2002-04-26, KPNQwest yesterday saw its shares lose nearly halftheir value after the European alternative telecommunications carrier conceded that it needed additional funding and might halt interest payments on its {XEU}1 9bn $1 7bn debt Bonds of the Dutch group also traded sharply lower in reaction to the warning as the main credit agencies downgraded its paper and said the ratings outlook remained negative Analysts said it could become the next of a string in the troubled sector to dilute shareholders through a debt-for-equity swap KPNQwest said it had called in Bear Stearns the US investment bank to look at ways of reorganising its finances adding Alternatives being explored include raising additional capital selling certain non-strategic assets and a recapitalisation of the balance sheet which may lead to the non-payment of interest of the company's high yield indebtedness  The company also clipped 20 per cent off its forecast for top-line earnings saying earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation this year was expected to be only {XEU}140m The {XEU}175m projected in February by Jack McMaster chief executive was itself the bottom end of a range that he had previously said could stretch to {XEU}200m KPN the privatised former monopoly that last year allowed Quest of the US to move to near-majority control at what had been their joint venture said yesterday its maximum exposure to KPNQwest was {XEU}700m Of that less than {XEU}150m would hit its cash position At {XEU}1 22 KPNQwest stock ended the day 47 per cent down and 62 per cent below its level in mid-April when analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston said the group faced a funding gap of up to {XEU}750m by the end of next year Yesterday the company refused to elaborate on the shortfall It said the outlook had darkened because of a recent dramatic deterioration in the wholesale market for data capacity in which it supplies other telecoms carriers That segment represents some 55 per cent of its revenues Last year the group moved into the black on an ebitda basis But net losses widened sharply in 2001 as it had to service more debt write down more in depreciation on its fibre optic network linking 60 European cities and make pay-offs for redundant staff and offices ,2
1998-04-04, From Mr Anthony H Rowley Sir So-called Cool Britannia April 1 is in reality no more than Fools' Britannia as is obvious from the fact that Rolls-Royce Motors is about to become the last British motor manufacturer to pass under foreign control It would have been understandable though no less deplorable if this had happened under former prime minister John Major since he was heir to a Thatcherite tradition which ignored the national interest and promoted the rights of international capital above all else That it should happen under a nominally socialist government proves just how unworthy the present government is to inherit the mantle of new Labour However doctrinaire previous Labour governments may have been they could not be accused of ignoring the national interest There is no other G-7 economy where the motor industry has been allowed to pass entirely under foreign control as it has in the UK Why is this It is because the other G-7 nations are advanced enough to realise that control is control and that the power to make strategic decisions which benefit the national interest resides in the fact of ownership The truth is that in Fools' Britain the interests of shareholders and managers have been elevated above all else and they have little regard for anything but mammon The pursuit of that will end in an ultimate loss of national purpose and pride As Shakespeare said this England dear for her reputation through the world is now leas'd out This land that was wont to conquer others hath made a shameful conquest of itself Anthony H Rowley Nishi Azabu 2-18-2 Minato-ku Tokyo 106 Japan From Mr David Marshall Sir Richard Adams's examination of the economy's health with a strong pound Sterling on steroids April 1 deserves deeper analysis In a fiercely competitive global industry UK aerospace has consistently reported the highest added-value performance in Europe over the last ten years with comparable efficiency to that of the US It contributed a £2 9bn positive contribution in 1996 to the trade balance an unchanging performance over 10 years The ability to do this is directly related to this industry owning its physical assets and intellectual property I suggest that this is the last of the UK's manufacturing engineering industries to do so ,1

2002-06-14, The US administration will need to offer heavy incentives if companies are to develop products to defend against biological attacks because many will not be commercially viable according to government officials and industry executives The administration is planning to invest heavily in research into treatments vaccines and diagnostic products for biological attacks involving diseases such as smallpox and anthrax However experts believe that the administration will need to devise new incentives if it is to involve the biotechnology industry in the development and manufacture of many of the treatments There is often a very small market for these types of products sometimes no more than a government stockpile said James Meegan who runs the microbiology and infectious diseases division at the National Institutes of Health NIH The government has announced that funding for NIH-sponsored research into bio-defence will see a huge increase from $274m {XEU}290m £187m this year to $1 74bn in 2003 an increase that Mr Meegan described as much larger than the war on cancer a few years ago For disease such as smallpox which transfers quickly between humans and therefore potentially threatens a large number of people there would a significant market he said When the administration put out a tender for a smallpox vaccine contract last year it received proposals from 11 companies Some diagnostic products which might be used continuously to test the water supply for instance could also have a large market opportunity However for products addressing a disease that was only likely to affect a small population even in the event of attack the government might need to find new ways of stimulating private sector investment such as subsidies for production costs Officials said there had been a huge amount of interest from the private sector in the administration's bio-defence programme with 12000 inquiries to the Department of Defence and 3000 to the Centres for Disease Control The Food and Drug Administration FDA has also introduced new rules which might permit some products to be approved in terms of efficacy after being tested only on animals However Robert Yetter from the FDA's Center for Biologics said that companies would still have to prove the products were safe in humans and that treatments could be withdrawn if they did not show any benefit once they are on the market and being used by humans The industry is pushing the administration to shorten approval times for new bio-defence treatments and to limit liability claims against manufacturers Carl Feldbaum president of the Biotechnology Industry Organisation said that the government needed to show a long-term commitment to bio-defence if the necessary products were to be developed Many of the threats were well-known in the early 1990s after the Gulf war but the momentum had been lost The administration also needed to streamline bureaucracy The government is stodgy The contracting procedures of government are anathema to biotech-nology companies he said ,3
1998-04-01, Government plans to make fraudulent or negligent directors of companies that go bust personally liable for unpaid National Insurance were attacked yesterday as a frightening erosion of limited liability Lord Higgins a Tory former Treasury minister fiercely criticised the proposals which would give civil servants the job of deciding whether negligence or fraud had occurred I am all for clobbering such directors but the repercussions of doing it in this way are enormous and highly dangerous  The plans were also attacked by Lord Goodhart a prominent lawyer and Liberal Democrat peer who said such directors should be pursued through the courts This is completely the wrong route for dealing with such cases he said The proposals were announced on Monday night in the Lords as a new clause to the social security bill Outlining the plans Lord Haskel said the National Insurance Fund loses about £150m a year when companies go into insolvency with National Insurance debts A good portion of these are related to the so-called phoenix set-ups where one company is put into insolvency only for a replacement company to rise from the ashes almost immediately  He said a recent analysis by the Contributions Agency which administers National Insurance identified 850 directors who had been associated with three or more insolvent companies which had cost the fund at least £26m Under the proposals where a company owes a National Insurance debt that it fails to pay in full and the failure is due to negligent or fraudulent behaviour of any or all of the directors the debt could be transferred to the directors personally Lord Haskel said the government would set up a small specialised highly trained body of staff to establish whether fraud or negligence was involved subject to a full right of appeal But Lord Goodhart said such cases should be dealt with in the courts where all the companies' debts including tax and private creditors could be taken into account It is all part of the same picture One cannot separate them out in that way  Peers also criticised another surprise move by the government which announced an amendment to the bill to enact the changes to employers' National Insurance contributions announced in the Budget Lord Higgins described it as an appalling abuse of parliamentary procedure insisting that such measures should be introduced in the Commons first to allow full scrutiny by MPs The Department of Social Security said the measures would have to go through the Lords because they involved National Insurance not tax which is the preserve of the Commons Lord Haskel said by introducing the changes as new clauses to the social security bill it would be possible to implement them by April 1999 In respect of changes to tax treatment of shares the move would keep to a minimum the period over which the income tax and National Insurance positions were out of step ,3
2002-06-10, The days are long gone when President Boris Yeltsin told Russia's local leaders to take all the sovereignty they could swallow and let the country's 89 regions and republics behave almost as if they were independent states President Vladimir Putin has put his emphasis squarely on recentralisation He is ending some of the worst abuses of regional power But not without cost He is relying heavily on army and KGB veterans who may understand discipline but appear to know little about economic policy civil administration or democratic process The measures he is using to check bad governors are dispiriting good governors too Three years ago you might have asked me if Russia was going to disintegrate says Yegor Gaidar a leading liberal politician That is not a problem any more The worry is too fast a centralisation It is better for Russia to work as a federation better for democracy  Getting the balance right between centre and regions will also be vital for business In spite of all the laws and regulations issued from Moscow governors still do much to determine the business climate The biggest companies can buy the governor or go over his head to Moscow But the governor is boss to everyone else He and his administration can determine whether investors are welcomed into a region and treated fairly or lured in and fleeced or shut out to protect existing business In those circumstances the last thing the Kremlin should be doing is dispiriting the good governors who can set an example to others But to judge from the mood of Mikhail Prusak governor of Novgorod region in north-west Russia that is just what is happening Appointed by Mr Yeltsin in 1991 and elected twice since then Mr Prusak quickly turned Novgorod into a model of business-friendly local government It attracted foreign investors including the British food company Cadbury Schweppes A leading Russian think-tank recently ranked Mr Prusak the fourth most influential of all Russia's regional leaders But interviewed at his office in the provincial capital Veliky Novgorod he gives the impression of a man more preoccupied by his loss of power than by his mastery of it He complains that the federal government is starving local governments of tax revenues He has nothing but contempt for Mr Putin's system of presidential representatives seven super-prefects appointed by the Kremlin to keep regions in line And he thinks Mr Putin was also wrong to throw the governors off the Federation Council the upper house of the federal parliament Their experience is needed in national politics Mr Prusak says Plenty of other local leaders think the same way But few of them have the nerve to say so out loud I have the political weight to do it says Mr Prusak The right fiscal policy he says was the one that used to be proclaimed if not always practised by Mr Yeltsin a 50-50 revenue split between federal and local budgets Now Mr Prusak says the federal government takes 80 per cent of the money They are telling us 'You may know how to make money in Novgorod but you don't know how to use it '  The federal government supports needy regions through budget transfers But the more a region has to depend on such transfers the more its independence is diminished Boris Nemtsov a former regional governor who now leads the Union of Right Forces a liberal political party says the federal government has engineered a collapse of regional finances turning the regions into colonies with Moscow as the mother country By Mr Nemtsov's calculation which is less drastic than that of Mr Prusak recent changes in tax laws have given the federal budget 63 per cent of revenues leaving 37 per cent for the regions He says the regions also suffer financially from the behaviour of Russia's big corporations especially its oil and gas companies which make their money in the provinces but pay most of their taxes in Moscow Some governors such as Gennady Khodyrev who runs the big industrial region of Nizhny Novgorod east of Moscow are more stoical on the tax front They recognise that the federal government is squeezing regional budgets to force regional governments to become more efficient The federal government wants two main things from local governments It wants them to pay more to their public sector workers many of whom receive derisory salaries And it wants a sharp reduction in the amount local governments spend subsidising the public utilities and services supplied to households Nizhny Novgorod has pushed ahead with a pilot scheme for making some households pay the full cost of heating and other services This has gone better than expected says Mr Khodyrev But in other parts of Russia such as Voronezh in the south west public demonstrations against so-called communal reform have been big enough to worry local and national authorities The second of Mr Prusak's complaints about the presidential representatives will find support from almost every governor in the country and from other quarters too The creation of the representatives is commonly viewed as one of the few big mistakes Mr Putin has made since taking office 2{1/2} years ago Mr Prusak objects in principle to asystem that he thinks is designed to harass governors and to catch them out He also objects to the people Mr Putin has favoured to fill the jobs As with many other high-level appointments Mr Putin has been recruiting from the military and security services where he himself used to work Five of the seven presidential representatives including the one overseeing Novgorod are ex-military and ex-KGB officers They know nothing about economic development says Mr Prusak All they really do he says is interfere The representatives are supposed to make sure that federal agencies such as the security services and the tax service operate effectively and impartially in the regions and do not get ordered around by local governors or crooks They are also meant to steer regional laws into conformity with federal laws after a decade of divergence But in practice most have reserved their main energies for power struggles with the governors They have become a big force in regional elections trying to promote their own or the Kremlin's candidates who are often yet more veterans of the military and the KGB Such candidates have won victories in Kaliningrad Ulyanovsk Voronezh Ingushetia and Smolensk Mr Putin's other main gambit to weaken the governors has been to oust them from the Federation Council the upper house of parliament The last ones left at the start of this year As partial compensation he has invited governors to join a Kremlin advisory body the State Council This may not be the end of Mr Putin's encircling tactics Last month he unveiled a new advisory body the Council of Legislators for speakers of the regional parliaments This body is supposed to encourage best practice in local legislation But some see it as a means for the Kremlin to close ranks with local parliaments so as to use them when needed against governors Laws passed last year also give Mr Putin powers to sack governors for serious misconduct He has yet to use them But he has persuaded one governor to resign after a series of scandals and he has looked on while his officials have used political and legal pressures to stop other unwanted governors seeking re-election As with much of Mr Putin's domestic policy the reining-in of the regions is a reasonable reaction to the excesses of the Yeltsin era But at least in Mr Yeltsin's day the regions were a source of pluralism and competition in politics They produced new potential leaders and tested new ideas All that risks being lost if Mr Putin goes on treating them as parking places for surplus secret servicemen ,3
2002-06-14, US-style campaigning for this weekend's Czech elections Vaclav Klaus's desperate centre-right Civic Democrats have bombarded voters with pre-recorded telephone messages of their master's voice Klaus's opponents claim they are delighted Czechs don't like this They are even more 'my home is my castle' than the British says Jan Kavan foreign minister Particularly irritatingly those on the receiving end cannot answer back and even if they hang up they cannot use their phone until the message finishes All very reminiscent argued one reader of the Mlada Fronta Dnes daily of Communist times Then the joke was that the president's telephone hotline to Moscow had a receiver but no microphone ,3

2002-04-30, DuPont the largest US chemicals company yesterday set the seal on restructuring plans for its lossmaking textiles and interiors division with proposals to cut 2000 jobs or 10 per cent of the unit's workforce The restructuring expected to save about $120m annually paves the way for a spin-off of the division by the end of next year More than two-thirds of the job cuts will be in the US with Europe taking up most of the rest The redundancies will largely be completed by July 31 DuPont which invented nylon in the 1930s said it would take a one-time charge of 12-16 cents per share to be finalised in the second-quarter earnings announcement DuPont Textiles and Interiors DTI which includes DuPont's lycra spandex nylon and polyester operations also said it would shut down its Terathayne manufacturing operation at Niagara Falls New York and close less competitive parts of its spandex facility in Waynesboro Virginia Richard Goodmanson DuPont executive vice-president chief operating officer and head of DTI refuted earlier claims that the latest redundancies would damage future revenue streams adding that the cuts would enhance competitiveness This month Steve McCracken DTI president conceded that the business had achieved zero growth over the last five years However Mr McCracken expected DTI to return to the industry average of 2 per cent growth in 2003 Cheap imports and slow orders from big retailers have hit the unit's annual sales which at $6 5bn are about a quarter of DuPont's total revenues Morgan Stanley is advising DuPont on the DTI spin-off plans which were announced in February An initial public offering of the textile unit is the favoured option but the company has not ruled out an outright sale or merger DuPont has cut 5500 jobs or 6 per cent of its workforce since April 2001 as part of efforts to remould itself as a science company This month DuPont predicted that its first-quarter operating earnings would top the best Wall Street estimates because of cost-cutting and solid sales of agricultural chemicals It said it expected to earn more than 51 cents per share excluding one-off items and other non-recurring factors ,2

2002-04-27, Labour's dishonesty over tax rises risks playing into the hands of far-right extremists the Liberal Democrats have warned in an apparent attempt to turn public cynicism to their electoral advantage Lord Rennard who is in charge of the Liberal Democrats' aggressive local election campaign said that whereas his party had been honest about the need to increase taxes for public services Labour say one thing before an election and another thing afterwards We think if politicians were straighter with people they'd feel less cynical about the political process    In the long run the fact that people don't trust politicians and don't believe they necessarily tell the truth or deliver makes people cynical and less inclined to vote and as turnouts go down that always favours extremists he said Politicians fear that fewer people will turn out to vote in next Thursday's local elections than ever before Lord Rennard believes turnout could fall as low as 25 per cent Disillusionment with mainstream politics favours ultra right-wing parties such as the British National party because people cast protest votes Extremists also tend to get a higher percentage of their supporters out to vote Lord Rennard said it was no wonder people were disillusioned that Labour had put up national insurance contributions despite pledging not to raise income tax in last June's general election The government is attempting to boost turnout by experimenting with new polling methods allowing people to vote by mobile phone text messaging and electronically for example But Lord Rennard believes the only experiment that works is giving everyone a postal vote whether they ask for one or not He is however concerned that such a system being trialled in Hackney in these local elections is open to fraud About 6000 seats are being contested in 172 English councils on May 2 The Liberal Democrats hope to defend the gains made from the Conservatives in the 1990s Lord Rennard predicts the party will either win or lose about 100 seats overall The Tories say they hope to gain up to 150 seats although their opponents believe they are aiming for far more but don't want to raise expectations Labour will not be drawn on its ambitions Lord Rennard says the Liberal Democrats are campaigning on their ability to provide better value for money for council taxpayers for example in Liverpool and Islington Other themes include adding 1p in the pound to income tax for education and their emphasis on the environment with recycling schemes Although many will vote on local issues Lord Rennard is expecting some people to use next week's elections to deliver their verdict on the Budget ,3
2002-04-03, The buildings of the Union brewery near the centre of Ljubljana are an odd mixture of architectural styles An impressive modern frontage conceals a jumble of buildings from different eras going back to the Habsburg empire The response of Slovenians to a takeover bid launched for Union in December by Interbrew of Belgium the world's second-largest brewer has been just as confused On one level the bid has been a rare act of modern competitive Slovenian capitalism Interbrew had to raise its agreed offer after a counter-bid from Lasko Union's only domestic rival The bidding war pushed up the price from T32 8bn to T36 2bn But the bid also provoked old-fashioned nationalist sentiment and underlined the opacity of many economic transactions in Slovenia Parliamentarians condemned any sale of Union to outsiders A state-owned fund sold its substantial stake in Union to Lasko in an off-market transaction The case follows more than a century of bitter rivalry between Union and Lasko based in a town of the same name in provincial Stajerska Last century Union secretly bought a majority stake in Lasko that it used in 1927 to shut down its rival It took 12 years for the brewery to reopen with new owners The competition between the breweries is not about profits says Ali Zerdin deputy editor of Mladina an influential weekly publication It's something more It's about regionalism It's between province and capital between the central region and Stajerska  Lasko claimed 51 per cent of the Slovenian market in 2000 Union accounted for another 46 per cent The Slovenian market however is peripheral to the present battle Lasko and Interbrew have been competing for several years to snap up breweries and markets throughout former Yugoslavia According to Maks Edelbaher an adviser to Lasko's managing director it is the last big European beer market ripe for development by outsiders Europe is more or less a consolidated market  and that includes many eastern European countries he says What remains is the Balkans  Interbrew wants to use Union a modern relatively high-capacity brewery to brew both Union and Interbrew's international brands such as Stella Artois to export elsewhere in former Yugoslavia Union would be Interbrew's third brewery in former Yugoslavia joining Zagrebacka Pivara in Croatia and Niksic in Montenegro Union has a small stake in Bosnia-Herzegovina's Sarajevska Pivara We have already finalised licence agreements with Union says Jak de Witte Interbrew's director for central Europe We want to expand and develop the brand out of Slovenia Giving all our distribution and sales assets would be our input to the strategic partnership  However Lasko believes it has a better chance of becoming the main Slovenian beer supplier to former Yugoslavia Some 40 per cent of Lasko's sales last year went outside Slovenia says Mr Edelbaher and the company has a reputation throughout the region Lasko was considered a Yugoslav brand in socialist Yugoslavia he says Lasko already owns Jadranska Pivara in Split Croatia The company is negotiating to buy a majority stake in Banjalucka Pivara in Bosnia-Herzegovina Interbrew had competed with Lasko to buy Banjalucka last autumn but withdrew over a legal dispute Union has barely any sales in other ex-Yugoslav republics Mr Edelbaher claims Union will not comment Mili Kus of Ljubljana-based e-Brokers agrees that Lasko has a better chance in the former Yugoslav market Most drinkers prefer the taste of Lasko she says Nevertheless Lasko may be flying in the face of wider world realities Polarisation in the brewing market means you either have big big big breweries or your local micro breweries she adds Interbrew now holds nearly 41 per cent of Union and Lasko at least 24 per cent Unsually for consensus-driven Slovenia the battle will be decided by regulators and the courts The case is likely to be only the first of many as Slovenia opens up to capital from the outside world says Neven Borak an economist Robert Wright,1

2002-06-25, In the debate on immigration currently rumbling in the US and raging in Europe business generally comes down on the side of greater openness For most employers the merits of being able to draw from a bigger pool of labour seem self-evident Economists however would be more cautious How you feel about immigration will depend on who you are and what you do and on who the immigrants are too Some of the most influential recent academic work on immigration has been done by George Borjas now at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard His simple model of the labour market assumes a fixed demand for labour Immigration raises the supply of labour so real wages fall and profits rise which must have some connection to business leaders' enthusiasm Although native workers then earn less their losses are more than offset by the rise in returns to capital so overall national income is higher Indeed the greater the effect of immigration on wages the bigger is the benefit to national income However calculations based on reasonably accurate figures for the extent of immigration and the sensitivity of wages in the US suggest the size of the effect may not be enormous Prof Borjas' estimates in 1994 were that the total gains to the US from immigration were only about $6bn £4bn a year a mere 0 1 per cent of US gross domestic product and certainly less than $20bn The redistribution caused by immigration is greater than the net gain The same assumptions for the US suggest that native workers lose about $114bn a year owing to immigration about 1 9 per cent of GDP while investors gain $120bn Given the social strains caused by such significant redistribution and the fact that the net fiscal effects of immigration are unclear all the estimates of the balance between the taxes paid by immigrants and the cost of the services they use are highly speculative Prof Borjas' analysis suggests that on balance the effects on natives may be negative If that extremely simple model of the labour market is made more realistic however scepticism about immigration is tempered For example if immigration increases the spread of skills and knowledge through the economy whether because immigrants bring new ideas or simply because a larger workforce generates more connections and sparks more ideas the benefits can be much greater Another refinement to the model incorporates differences in skills in the workforce In the US the wages of skilled workers are apparently more responsive to changes in supply than the wages of unskilled workers As it is the fall in wages that generates the surplus from immigration the gains will be greater if the immigrants are skilled rather than unskilled Using some plausible estimates of the responsiveness of wages to labour supply the net benefit to the US of immigration could rise to more than $40bn a year if only skilled workers were admitted In practice however immigrants to the US tend to be less skilled than the native population In 1998 the typical immigrant worker in the US earned 23 per cent less than the typical native worker Immigrants in the 1980s and 1990s have been less skilled than those of previous waves A new paper by Ximena Clark of the World Bank Timothy Hatton of Essex University and Jeffrey Williamson of Harvard examines why this may have happened The change in the origins of immigrants into the US since the second world war has been remarkable In the 1950s Europeans most of them from western Europe formed more than half the total by the 1990s they were down to just 5 per cent In the 1900s they had been 92 per cent The proportions from developing countries have risen accordingly with the share from the Caribbean peaking in the 1970s and that from Asia in the 1980s The shares of immigration from Mexico Africa and eastern Europe continue to increase This has not been a deliberate act of policy The 1965 reform of immigration law put a strong priority on family reunification ahead of employment as a justification for legal immigration It was argued at the time that because the existing stock of immigrants was largely European the flow of new immigrants would be too Clark Hatton and Williamson set up a model of worldwide migration to the US to see why that argument has turned out to be so wrong The answer seems to be that whatever a country's immigration policy may be people will come only if they want to With each passing decade since the war Europeans have grown less needy The majority of immigrants to the US have come from the countries closest to the US which have had the highest proportions of young people and have offered the worst economic opportunities One conclusion is that although the US might be better off if it accepted only skilled immigrants cutting off unskilled immigration could cut off immigration altogether Several countries have changed immigration requirements in attempts to increase the supply of skilled workers but found they were not an attractive enough prospect to attract the immigrants they wanted As Prof Borjas says immigration is about much more than the financial considerations it touches on the most important questions of justice human rights and conflicting political interests The case for open immigration will have to be made on those arguments as well as the economics ed crooks@ft com  The

2002-06-15, Manulife Financial Corp the Canadian insurer yesterday threatened to shut down its Indonesian operations if a court decision to declare its local unit bankrupt was not overturned Judge Hasan Basri of the Central Jakarta Court declared PT Asuransi Jiwa Manulife Indonesia bankrupt on Thursday claiming that it had not paid $2 6m in dividends to creditors in 1999 Manulife said no dividend was declared that year The bankruptcy suit was filed by PT Dharmala Sakti Sejahtera the former joint venture partner controlled by Indonesian businessman Suyanto Gondokusumo The ruling is outrageous said Philip Hampden Smith Manulife Indonesia president Manulife Indonesia is one of the country's largest insurers posting an $8 6m profit in 2001 Thursday's ruling is another step in a two-year legal battle between the former joint venture partners The decision is likely to heighten concerns among foreign investors and international agencies over Indonesia's uncertain legal system Controversial court rulings involving Manulife have prompted the International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Bank to express concern over Manulife's treatment in Indonesia Manulife said it would appeal the decision at Indonesia's Supreme Court The legal conflict started in October 2000 when the Canadian company bought a 40 per cent stake owned by its local partner in a state auction ,2

2002-06-26, WorldCom the stricken US telecoms group yesterday fired its chief financial officer after uncovering what appears to be a $3 8bn fraud The group said last night it would have to restate its 2001 and first-quarter 2002 financial statements after an internal audit revealed that some $3 8bn of operating expenses were improperly recorded as capital spending boosting cash flow and margins The group's shares dropped 75 per cent in after-hours trading after CNBC the business television channel reported that Scott Sullivan chief financial officer had been sacked A person close to the company said that executives had told him today would be the bleakest in WorldCom's history The news of potential fraud at WorldCom which became a symbol of dealmaking prowess at the peak of the bull market could push the company to the brink of bankruptcy and will rock US markets US stocks are already under a cloud following the collapse of Enron the energy trader in December and allegations of financial scandals at other companies including Tyco the conglomerate and Adelphia the cable TV company Our senior management team is shocked by these discoveries said John Sidgmore who took over as chief executive at the end of April after Bernie Ebbers the dealmaker who built WorldCom and epitomised the telecoms bull market stepped down under pressure from the board His resignation ushered in a further period of distress for the group that like Enron was audited by Andersen WorldCom replaced the discredited accountancy firm with KPMG last month After WorldCom notified Andersen about the result of the audit the firm said its audit report for 2001 could not be relied upon the company said WorldCom stock had fallen 8 cents to 83 cents in regular trading yesterday and dropped to 23 cents on the Instinet system within minutes of the CNBC report WorldCom said it had also accepted the resignation of David Myers as senior vice-president and controller and notified the Securities and Exchange Commission The group said the audit committee of its board of directors had hired William McLucas a lawyer at Wilmer Cutler & Pickering and a former head of enforcement at the SEC to lead an independent probe Mr McLucas said he had been hired very recently and had not yet had time to start the investigation Mr Ebbers' departure in April followed a collapse in WorldCom's share price and market capitalisation which stood at $180bn at its peak At yesterday's close the company was worth just under $2 5bn In March WorldCom revealed that the SEC was conducting a wide-ranging informal investigation into its accounting WorldCom said it had been asked to hand over voluntarily documents relating to a wide range of issues Reporting by Andrew Hill Stephanie Kirchgaessner Andrew Balls and Peter Thal Larsen Deal bonanza Page 27,2
2002-04-17, Super Tuesday lived up to its name as Wall Street absorbed a raft of upbeat sales forecasts from an array of top names and Europe was higher as its corporate sector had good news of its own The latest US consumer price index which showed costs rose less than economists had expected in May also gave the markets a boost as the figures suggested the Federal Reserve would be able to delay interest rate rises until June at least Super Tuesday is the nickname traditionally applied to the second day of the US corporate reporting season when 179 of the S&P 500 constituents unveil figures By midsession the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite were rallying strongly the markets applauded higher sales forecasts from a raft of industry leaders including Texas Instruments and General Motors Europe staged a broadly based advance of its own after Dutch electronics group Philips took the market by surprise with its return to profits in the first quarter The upbeat sales forecasts from leading US technology companies also breathed new life into some of Europe's TMT sectors Against this decidedly upbeat background a survey of institutional investors provided a reminder of how investors felt just days and weeks ago The monthly Merrill Lynch fund manager survey found the outlook for world equities had deteriorated in the past month Institutional investors said profit expectations fell interest rate prospects deteriorated equity valuations appeared more stretched and sentiment had retreated it said Michael Morgan,2
2002-04-18, The opening of Sarajevo stock exchange SASE this month was a modest affair perhaps reflecting Bosnia's confusion about why it now has not one but two bourses to serve a population of fewer than than 4m SASE which staggered into existence after a delay of a year arrived just a couple of weeks after the launch of Banjalucka Berza its counterpart in Republika Srpska Sarajevo founded by eight brokers offers trading in about 100 companies and privatisation funds Turnover has been symbolic so far We are still at the very beginning and did not expect much more said Milan Bozic director of Banjalucka For now our main aim is to inform people where and how to trade because many do not even know what a bourse is  This may seem odd considering there are already 1 5m shareholders in Bosnia 37 5 per cent of the population The high number of shareholders is the result of mass privatisation in which the government has given away half of the state's capital With the privatisation process yet to be completed the number of capitalists is set to grow But it will be hard to persuade Bosnians to invest in equities Equity trading is something new for this region and it will take time to regain their trust after the previous administrations lost it said Akif Serdarevic director of SASE The directors of both exchanges fear the number of shares on offer will by far exceed demand as financially challenged Bosnians rush to cash in their shares when they are allowed to do so For investors to show interest in Bosnia the country needs to be open for foreign investment and the current state of privatisation process in the country shows the opposite said Andrew Roberts emerging markets economist at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London Mr Roberts added that the country and indeed the region of former Yugoslavia are still ethnically divided and too risky for foreign investors to flock in While the international community says its primary aim is establishment of a united economic and political model in Bosnia's two entities creation of two bourses with the international community's blessing suggests the opposite But Kevin Sullivan at the Office of the High Representative the international body which oversees the running of the country said the bourses should be viewed simply as regional trading boards that were in contact with each other Yet the trading platforms only deal in shares based in their respective territory Mr Sullivan did not dismiss the possibility of co-operation between the bourses Indeed the creation of a trading platform incorporating the whole of Balkans could bring them together he said For the survival of the organisations appears to depend solely on their ability to co-operate with each other and their counterparts in other republics of former Yugoslavia We have to be aware that SASE won't survive without further mergers and regionalisation SASE advisory board director Muris Cicic said at the launch party Nerma Jelacic,2
2002-06-28, Sparring Although Eliot Spitzer the New York attorney-general who thrust himself into the spotlight by spearheading an investigation of Wall Street securities analysts was given a hero's welcome before a Senate sub-committee this week his reviews were not quite as glowing on the other side of Capitol Hill Spitzer has had a simmering war of words with top Republicans at the House financial services committee for months but following his appearance before the Senate on Wednesday the battle became unusually personal Richard Baker the respected chairman of the capital markets sub-committee fired the first shot back in April writing to the SEC to warn that Spitzer's investigation of Merrill Lynch was interfering with the efforts of Congress and the SEC to set a national policy on analysts' conflict of interests A month later Baker turned up the heat saying the settlement Spitzer finally reached with Merrill imposed illegitimate and unenforceable rules on the bank But on Wednesday Spitzer finally fired back telling the Senate that Baker had a flawed understanding of his case Baker seemed to take the rebuke as the last straw Spitzer's only known financial expertise as far as I can tell has been cutting a special deal to jump ship from his old school buddy's sinking hedge fund Baker said To me it simply doesn't inspire confidence to have a failed investor who didn't understand the markets then making up his own rules about how to protect all other investors now ,3

2002-04-15, Received wisdom dictates that natives of St Petersburg are more European in outlook and cooler of temperament than their counterparts in rival Moscow Whether or not this is true of Vladimir Putin the city is pleased to count Russia's president as one of its own Mr Putin is clearly attached to his home town whose cadres he has systematically plundered to staff his administration It is the closest the city has come to real power since Lenin moved the capital to Moscow Alongside Petersburg-born economic liberals in Moscow since the early days of Boris Yetsin's presidency Mr Putin has recruited faces from his career in St Petersburg city hall and the Leningrad KGB Strategic appointees include Sergei Ivanov defence minister Sergei Mironov speaker of parliament's upper chamber and from April Sergei Ignatiev head of the Central Bank of Russia But Russia's second-largest city still comes a distant second to Moscow in economic clout Petersburg's 4 5m inhabitants see the 300th anniversary next year of the city's creation on an autocratic whim of Peter the Great as a test of the exported elite's commitment to their alma mater Inconveniently for Mr Putin the city is run by Vladimir Yakovlev In 1996 Mr Yakovlev defected from the administration of the then mayor Anatoly Sobchak and defeated him in gubernatorial elections Mr Putin was a close ally of Sobchak and his protege He famously accused Mr Yakovlev of indirectly hastening his former boss's death in March 2000 The same year Mr Yakovlev was re-elected with 72 per cent of the vote despite clear signals from the Kremlin that it wanted a new governor in St Petersburg A vendetta in the northern capital was widely forecast These days Mr Putin is represented in the city by Viktor Cherkessov a Leningrad KGB comrade of Mr Putin and his presidential envoy for north-west Russia But so far Mr Cherkessov has not clashed conspicuously with Mr Yakovlev Three of Mr Yakovlev's deputies have come under corruption investigations in recent months but the motives for the local prosecutors' new-found zeal is unclear We do not feel the influence of Cherkessov says Mikhail Gorny of Petersburg's Strategia think-tank Yakovlev in his own right will never go against Putin so the initiative will come from Putin but for now he has no need to do this Maybe in a year things will heat up again  Next year Russia holds parliamentary elections The following year Mr Yakovlev is expected to seek a third term as governor and Mr Putin a second term as president Both men are taking a personal interest in a successful 300th birthday party The opinion of Vladimir Putin is that the best way to celebrate is to improve the lives of people in the city enthuses Alexander Zapesotsky rector of the St Petersburg University of Humanities and Social Sciences Our governor thinks the same and in this they are working together  Mr Zapesotsky is a sharp-suited academic and impresario whose office is adorned with pictures of himself entertaining Russian stars alongside students from his university Mr Yakovlev has given him the task of creating a $25m fund of domestic and foreign sponsorship for the celebrations The city says Mr Zapesotsky offers fast-track processing of investors' planning proposals in return But in addition to the festivities the authorities want to restore crumbling facades fill pot-holes and give voters some civic pride Under Mr Yakovlev the local economy has recovered from the 1998 national economic crisis Foreign investment in the city last year was $1 7bn up 14 per cent from 2000 But Petersburg is in a state of disrepair Moreover pensioners and veterans make up around one-third of the population putting a strain on the $2bn annual local budget To restore the dowager empress city to its former glory Mr Yakovlev has had to look for federal funds The largest and highest profile schemes connected to the 300th anniversary such as building a ring road and strengthening flood defences depend on Moscow The more federal money the city uses the more limited is local power says Mikhail Gorny Since 2000 St Petersburg has followed the national trend for humble unanimity behind the hugely popular president In the parliamentary elections in 1999 Mr Yakovlev was prominent in the All Russia-Fatherland movement that unsuccessfully challenged the pro-Putin Unity party The factions have now merged into one broad pro-Putin party Fatherland and Unity and Mr Yakovlev sits on its supreme council The Governor has enough political sense not to steal the limelight from the president says Yuri Solonin chairman of the party's St Petersburg wing of the 300th anniversary His best option is to put himself in a position of solidarity which is what he is doing  For the time being there is no obvious challenger to Mr Yakovlev who leads opinion polls and is popular among the ageing public sector workers whose jobs he pledged to protect in his election campaign apparently with some success But Petersburgers want their city to equal Moscow and for this they look to Mr Putin The president's portrait is widely on sale in the city Of course we are very proud he is from here says Tatiana a shop attendant He does not drink and he speaks foreign languages  Meanwhile Petersburg's liberal intelligentsia complains discreetly of a growing cult of deference to the city's favourite son They are awaiting clarification next year as to whether Mr Putin represents the city's fabled western moderation or the whimsical autocracy of its founder ,3
2002-06-13, Share prices across theUS grocery retail sector tumbled yesterday after Safeway the biggest US operator said that it would cut prices to fend off competition from discounters such as Wal-Mart The pledge came as Safeway reduced its earnings forecasts for the second quarter by up to 8 per cent and for the full year by up to 9 per cent citing disappointing sales Steve Burd chief executive told a conference call that identical-store sales for the current quarter ending June 15 were likely to be down by about 1 1 per cent Analysts had forecast an increase of at least 1 per cent He added that the US recession was driving consumers into the arms of discount superstore operators such as Wal-Mart and warehouse clubs such as Costco and Wal-Mart's Sam's Club As unemployment has continued to grow you have seen the discount operators report increasingly strong sales while you have seen the supermarket sector report lighter sales he said Clearly in tough economic times people are prepared to travel further go to multiple locations and really concentrate a bit more on price  Safeway shares were down $4 62 or nearly 13 per cent to $31 56 by midday in New York Albertson's the US number two was down 6 5 per cent to $29 95 and Kroger number three 6 6 per cent to $19 80 Shares of Ahold of the Netherlands and Belgium's Delhaize which have sizeable US operations also closed down sharply in Europe Wal-Mart the world's largest retailer made clear its determination to continue its aggressive push into food at annual shareholders' and analysts' meetings last week The company is moving into California Safeway's home state with its supercenter format which combines grocery and general merchandise Mr Burd said that Safeway would in future reinvest 75 to 100 per cent of the gross margin gains it was achieving from efficiency improvements up from the current 25 per cent into lower prices and promotions to boost sales growth This is our first negative identical-store sales quarter for nine years he said It is not a comfortable spot for us to be in and we don't like it  Safeway now expected second-quarter earnings per share of about 71 to 73 cents compared with consensus estimates of 77 cents Full-year earnings were expected to be about $2 86 to $2 90 compared with previous forecasts of $3 15 However Mr Burd added that Safeway's poor sales performance was due to internal as well as external factors A drive to reduce shrink or spoilage of fresh foods had been mishandled leading to product shortages that drove customers away A move to centralised buying and merchandising was also causing disruption ,2
2002-06-25, From Mr Stephen Hellinger Sir It was interesting to read your report on the findings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development regarding poverty reduction New approach 'could halt' growth in poverty June 19 Unctad's emphasis on increasing local productive capacity and production for local consumption rather than on expanding free trade primary exports and welfare is consistent with the findings of the multi-country initiative recently completed jointly by the Structural Adjustment Participatory Review International Network Saprin the civil society network that our organisation co-ordinates and James Wolfensohn president of the World Bank The Structural Adjustment Participatory Review Initiative which was funded by five European governments the European Union and the UN Development Programme among others found that the adoption by the countries studied in Latin America Africa Asia and central Europe of economic adjustment policies prescribed by the Bank has had a devastating impact on the enormous number of small and medium-sized enterprises and farms that produce for the local population and employ most of the labour force As a result of precipitous trade liberalisation indiscriminate privatisation financial-sector deregulation labour-market flexibilisation agricultural policies that favour export producers and other reforms employment wages family income and food security have fallen sharply while poverty and inequality have increased The Unctad report was also correct in its point that the current poverty-reduction strategies sponsored by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund still look like the old structural adjustment programmes To date the Bank has refused to permit any country to tackle poverty through changes in the aforementioned policies Next month Saprin meets the Bank's president and will learn whether after nearly a year of Bank inaction he will honour his commitment to follow up on the Sapri findings with meaningful policy-related changes Stephen Hellinger President The Development Group for Alternative Policies Washington DC 20005 US,3
2002-04-19, Gordon Brown's move to close yawning gaps in the stamp duty regime did not come as a surprise In the weeks leading up to the Budget announcement Inland Revenue officials sounded increasingly loud alarms with each new tax avoidance scheme passed under their collective noses for review Nevertheless confirmation of the industry's worst fears has been received as a serious blow by property pundits Closure of the loopholes is part of a much wider government review of its arguably anachronistic stamp duty regime In an age where deals are transacted in cyberspace does a tax on paper documents really have much relevance Nevertheless stamp duty is a nice little earner for the Exchequer and the chancellor shows no signs of relinquishing it Guy Napier head of the City of London office at Knight Frank the consultants says closure of the loopholes hits particularly hard at places like the City where almost all deals are above the £10m minimum threshold targeted by the Inland Revenue I can't think of a deal for over £10m that we have been involved with that hasn't had a tax-avoidance scheme Mr Napier says Gordon Keenay senior manager in the stamp taxes group at accountants KPMG says that even the most elaborate tax avoidance schemes the ones requiring the most expensive payments to accountants and lawyers begin to make sense at transactions of £5m and above Mr Napier says closure of the loopholes will affect debt-driven buyers particularly badly They are mainly private investors who borrow 90 per cent or more of the transaction price These investors can make relatively large profits on small investments But those profits are in many instances wiped out by the 4 per cent stamp duty Data from the British Property Federation suggest that the Treasury is quite right to be concerned about loss of revenue through avoidance schemes In the 2000-01 tax year revenue from stamp duty on commercial property deals above £1m was £95 1m down from £124 1m and £163 0m in the two previous tax years Mr Napier argues that closure of tax loopholes marks a sharp reversal of government policy Until now the Treasury has turned a blind eye to these schemes he says The Treasury makes clear it views the growing use of schemes as posing a threat to the Exchequer and to the economy in general It is particularly concerned about special purpose vehicles companies usually domiciled offshore created for the sole purpose of owning property and which retain the legal title while selling on the beneficial title No new document on ownership needs to be registered and stamp duty is avoided The other main scheme involves the transfer of properties into a subsidiary followed quickly by the sale of shares in that entity to a third party attracting stamp duty on the share sale at 0 5 per cent rather than the 4 per cent on property transactions In a 46-page consultation paper outlining plans for the reform of the 300-year-old stamp duty regime Ruth Kelly economic secretary pulls no punches She writes Some companies are determined not to pay their full share of duty and structure property transactions in increasingly artificial ways to achieve that We are determined to stop this abuse  Treasury forecasts call for a £150m increase in tax revenues in the first year following the reforms and up to £450m thereafter Among the measures suggested to wipe out tax avoidance is a new requirement that all purchasers notify the Inland Revenue of the transactions as soon as any significant payment is made to satisfy a contractual obligation This will end the loophole through which properties transferred into a special purpose vehicle are subjected to a split title The government also proposes to review the process by which stamp duty is assessed on leases and suggests that leases shorter than three years may be exempted Liz Peace director-general of the BPF expresses some optimism that government will at least listen sympathetically to the industry's views Within minutes of the chancellor's speech on Wednesday the BPF was called to Ms Kelly's office for a meeting Meanwhile Mr Napier suggests that it is only a matter of time before well-paid lawyers and accountants devise new strategies for circumventing stamp duty The Inland Revenue does not refute the argument but suggests it will be kept busy We can only close them tax loopholes as fast as they open them up it says ,3
1998-04-03, Private shareholders yesterday inflicted an important defeat on the vulture funds and institutional investors in the fight for the £60bn investment trust sector Their help was crucial in voting down proposals to convert partially Baring Tribune Investment Trust to a unit trust The plan was prompted by the wide discount between the trust's share price and the value of its underlying assets Private shareholders may have won the battle but the institutions are likely to win the war by forcing several trusts including Baring Tribune to offer them cash exits Despite the vote Baring Tribune's board said yesterday it would put forward reconstruction proposals by the end of this month Analysts said the Baring Tribune saga showed how vulnerable trusts were The trust a generalist fund with £358m of assets has a good performance record and a 29 per cent stake linked to the manager in the form of Baring private clients The message to the investment trust world is that good performance is no longer an immunity against attack shareholders now expect the managers and the board to keep the discount narrow said one analyst Yesterday's vote showed the split between private and institutional shareholders in trusts A packed shareholders' meeting voted 57 per cent to 43 per cent against the unitisation plans put forward by Advance UK Trust the so-called vulture fund and two other institutional shareholders Miles Rivett-Carnac chairman of Baring Tribune pointed to the high turnout shareholders representing more than three-quarters of the equity voted compared with a typical turnout of less than one-third and the strong opposition to the motion from private investors But he said There is no doubt the institutional shareholders no longer see any role in holding an international general investment trust such as Baring Tribune They say 'we have a huge investment team we can do it ourselves '  Baring Tribune is already subject to two rival offers Fleming Claverhouse Investment Trust yesterday said it had put proposals to the board which could lead to an agreed bid Legal & General the fund manager has proposed changing the trust into an index-tracking investment trust David Rough group director investments at L&G said We are trying to be the white knight by not proposing unitisation  But one analyst said The biggest cash element provided it is backed by a reasonable proposal for a rollover vehicle will win ,2
2002-06-27, Sunday mornings in America are no longer the sole preserve of churchgoers and joggers The ChristianSabbath is now a day for visiting your bank manager to discuss an overdraft or to pay in a cheque at the branch according to Commerce Bancorp If that does not excite you and the crowd inside a local New York branch last Sunday seemed pretty keen Commerce offers a variety of other customer service stunts including machines to turn small change into dollar bills opening extra tellers during busy periods and extended weekday opening hours Comparisons between Commerce and a supermarket are intentional Commerce has been built on the belief that selling bank accounts and loans is little different from offloading fresh fruit and breakfast cereal Vernon Hill Commerce's founding president and chairman makes few bones about his admiration for the business models of Sam Walton founder of Wal-Mart the world's largest supermarket group and Bob Nardelli Home Depot's head Mr Hill honed his entrepreneurial flair in the fast food business he still jointly owns 45 Burger King franchises in the suburban Philadelphia area and employs more emotive language than traditional banking gnomes We are making banking friendly making it fun he says Mr Hill's colourful approach to the normally grey business of selling bank services appears to be paying dividends In the past year Commerce's deposits grew 40 per cent to $11 3bn This compares with an average of 13 per cent among the top 30 US banks according to First Manhattan Consulting Group which analyses the financial services industry Commerce's bottom and top lines are equally impressive Revenue surged 34 per cent and earnings rose 29 per cent in 2001 Their financial results are off the charts says Gordon Goetzmann managing vice-president of First Manhattan Consulting The focus on deposit creation is crucial because core deposits account for most of a retail bank's income says Mr Goetzmann Core deposits create 87 per cent of consumer profits and 90 per cent of small business profits are from core deposits according to First Manhattan's analysis Commerce's other masterstroke was to stick with the bank branch concept in the dotcom boom when every other bank was trying to coax customers on to the web Mr Goetzmann says The renaissance of the bank branch has been touted by Commerce's US rivals including Wells Fargo Fleet and Bank of America But according to Mr Goetzmann there is really no one similar to Commerce in retail banking Mr Hill would agree with this diagnosis What we have learnt to produce is the highest deposit growth rate with the lowest cost of deposits he says The consumer is making a conscious decision 'I will give Commerce Bank my money and I will accept lower deposit interest rates in return for better retail service ' This is a rational decision by customers  Mr Hill's goal is to improve on the normal crummy banking service offered by rivals in the US We are making it friendly and getting rid of stupid rules  According to Mr Hill the stupid rules that other retail banks have created are closing all the time asking too much for an interest cheque book account charging stupid fees trying to push customers from branch banking to an electronic channel and an endless amount of little things What drives people crazy is not one rule in particular It is the things that banks do not do or the things that they charge for that drive people away  Commerce claims to be the world's most convenient bank which Mr Hill defines as always there for you whether it's a call centre open all round the clock or some other service A prime example of this service is the Penny Arcade a bright red coin-drop machine that swaps loose change for a paper receipt that can be exchanged for less bulky notes People often come in with biscuit jars full of small change to pour into the machines which are prominently placed in each Commerce store The service not only provides some amusement to queuing customers it is free to anyone with a need to empty their pockets of change You don't even have to bank with us to use it Mr Hill says However the Penny Arcades show another side of the Commerce strategy spend money to get results To date the machines have cost Commerce Bank $10m Mr Hill says We get no direct return on that money but it is adding extra access to our bank The message is not that we take your coins it is one of the things we do to enhance the retail experience  Mr Hill expresses some doubts about the effect of the dotcom boom on financial services online-only banks have basically failed he says but Commerce possesses one of the most successful banking websites with 29 per cent of its customers using its internet service One of the secrets of Commerce's success is that it has not become obsessed with one type of service a trick Mr Hill claims that he learnt from fast food delivery In the fast food business we make all our money on sales of Coke But that does not mean I am going to stop selling hamburgers he says The service ethic is drilled into employees at the Commerce University a teaching establishment modelled on the burger-flipping college operated by fast food chain McDonald's Here Commerce students learn how to wow their customers There is an almost cult-like attitude towards providing superior service says Edward Najarian a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch As the Commerce Bank juggernaut speeds into the premier league of the top 30 US banks its greatest challenge could be its own success Not that many analysts believe Commerce Bank's deposit growth will slow The success of Commerce's strategy has encouraged many imitators according to John Klein managing director at Sandler O'Neill Banking is generally a pretty competitive business he says When you see one competitor doing very well it often invites a lot of the competition to copy it  Oversupply of bank branches is now a real danger in the US and possibly the greatest threat to Commerce's business model Mr Klein adds I'd question whether the market needs that many branches  However he also believes that many of Commerce's rivals will fail because they are too big and un-focused It is hard to instill a new culture Rather than offering this new package across the whole franchise they are trying to do it selectively he says Mr Hill claims to have the big US retail banks in his sights The conventional wisdom is that the guys with the big market share win he says In reality the guys with the big market share are easier to take accounts from  The question is whether Commerce can continue to dazzle its customers and Wall Street when it becomes the biggest bank on the block ,2

1998-04-01, Shares in Scios surged yesterday after the biotechnology group released clinical results for a new acute congestive heart failure treatment and said it would be filing for approval with the Food & Drug Administration within 30 days The company's stock was up 6 5 per cent to $12{15/16} at noon Richard Casey chief executive of the California-based company predicted that global sales of the product would reach nearly $2bn annually However David Stone a biotechnology analyst at Cowen & Co put the drug's potential at half that figure There's no question that Scios' product is effective but to really understand how much it will sell we need to see head-to-head studies that show how it compares to existing treatments said Mr Stone The new treatment is the recombinant version of a naturally occurring hormone that is part of the body's normal response to a heart attack The hormone known as BNP was discovered in pigs in 1988 and isolated in humans the following year BNP works by relaxing blood vessels boosting fluid excretion and increasing sodium retention Heart failure affects 4 9m Americans a year Scios' drug is aimed at the 1m of those patients who go to hospital Scios said it planned to announce a global marketing agreement with a large pharmaceutical company for the new drug within the next few weeks Even before this week's announcement Scios' share price had quadrupled since last May ,2
2002-06-19, In an unexpected and important victory for reform-minded Democrats the Senate banking committee yesterday overwhelming passed legislation that would impose stringent new controls on the accounting industry including a blanket ban on performing most non -audit services for clients The bill is still not assured passage in the full Senate as Senator Phil Gramm the most powerful Republican on financial issues said he would work to block it But the Committee's 17-4 vote which included six Republicans gives the measure new momentum that makes its final approval more likely The continuing fall-out from the Enron scandal and a wave of revelations of US corporate malfeasance have made politicians acutely aware of the need to overcome their differences and create legislation designed to restore investor confidence in financial statements The bill promoted by Paul Sarbanes the Democratic head of the committee will now move on to a full debate by the Senate However Mr Gramm is still opposed to key elements of the bill particularly the proposed curbs on the additional work that accountancy firms can carry out for their audit clients Accountancy firms have come under fire for potential conflicts of interest created by carrying out lucrative consultancy work for clients whose companies they also audit But Mr Gramm sides with the profession in believing that restrictions on work are not a matter for legislation and should be decided in time by a new regulatory board The powers of the new regulator which would be created by the bill are also the subject of dispute The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants the profession's main body has told its members that Mr Sarbanes's plan would lead to a de facto government takeover of the profession and would create unnecessary bureaucracy Mr Gramm is still pledging to oppose the bill on the floor of the Senate Even if the Senate can pass a bill it would still need to be reconciled with a version passed by the House of Representatives That version is seen as more lenient on accountants The Securities and Exchange Commission the US's chief financial regulator is meanwhile pressing ahead with its own proposals to overhaul the profession Harvey Pitt the commission's chairman will provide further details of his plans tomorrow He believes that a new accountancy regulation board should be run by a majority of people from outside the profession The board should also be funded in part by public companies ,3
2002-04-19, Equity markets suffered a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the Milan air crash on fears of a repeat of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 163 points to 10057 on reports that suggested the crash might have been the result of terrorist action There were modest gains for US Treasury bonds as investors opted for safe haven investments But as later reports suggested that the crash into the Pirelli tower was an accident the Dow quickly recovered By 1pm in New York the Dow was just 53 points lower at 10167 The market's rapid initial fall demonstrated that investors remain nervous about the potential for further terrorist attacks in the US and Europe Stock markets fell heavily in the wake of the September 11 disaster but recovered the lost ground late last year with the help of interest rate cuts from the world's central banks US military success in Afghanistan and the lack of any further attacks on the US mainland also helped restore investor sentiment Most European markets had already closed when news of the crash became known By the end of the main session in the late closing Milan exchange the benchmark Mibtel index was just 0 2 per cent lower But this was quickly extended to a loss of 0 5 per cent in the first half hour of evening trade The market's knee-jerk reaction was illustrated when shares in Pirelli which were flat at the end of the official close quickly opened up a loss of 2 5 per cent in evening trade Although the building involved in the crash is known as the Pirelli tower it does not house Pirelli's offices Frankfurt's blue chip Xetra Dax index fell more than 2 per cent on news of the events in Milan but quickly trimmed that loss to 1 5 per cent within an hour of the start of the evening trading session ,2
2002-04-19, Electrolux the world's biggest maker of household appliances yesterday forecast flat demand in its main markets this year saying consumer confidence in North America was still shaky Its caution disappointed investors who had hoped for more upbeat comments from the group particularly after Whirlpool the largest US appliance manufacturer forecast a 5 per cent rise in US industry shipments this year The group's shares fell SKr4 to SKr184 despite better than expected first-quarter figures Electrolux whose brand names include AEG Zanussi and Frigidaire said it expected unchanged demand in both Europe and North America this year This was despite the fact that US industry shipments of core appliances such as cookers refrigerators freezers washing machines and tumble driers rose by 10 per cent in the first quarter There is still uncertainty regarding consumer confidence and spending particularly in North America the group said Peter Lawrence analyst with Lehman Brothers in London said It's a conservative forecast but it shows the new chief executive Hans Straberg is continuing the cautious management style  Mr Lawrence said Electrolux was regaining market share in the US after a difficult 2001 when it was hit by the costs of launching a new refrigerator range and aggressive pricing by rivals But market share was still below the level of two years ago The European market remained sluggish with core appliance shipments falling 1 per cent and the German market down by 8 per cent But Electrolux's margins rose due to cost-cutting lower raw material costs and market share gains Underlying pre-tax profits rose 20 per cent to SKr1 8bn $174m After including SKr1 9bn in capital gains mainly from the sale of the remaining part of its leisure appliances business profits swelled to SKr3 7bn Sales were stable at SKr33 6bn The group is cutting 2800 jobs as part of a restructuring programme  SKF the Swedish maker of rolling bearings produced better than expected first-quarter pre-tax profits of SKr761m just SKr30m lower than a year ago despite weak markets It predicted demand would remain weak in the second quarter although there were more signs of recovery in North America The group's shares which have had a strong run this year closed SKr5 higher at SKr251 5 ,2

2002-04-26, What would we do without hindsight The shock waves of Jean-Marie Le Pen's success in the first round of France's presidential election had barely subsided before all agreed it had been inevitable Within hours there were a dozen easy explanations for Europe's lurch to the extreme right The script had been written by the successes of ugly nationalism in Austria Italy Denmark Even in the profoundly liberal Netherlands a large slice of the electorate had fallen under the insidious spell of xenophobic populism Lionel Jospin the Jimmy Carter of French politics had fought a hopeless campaign Fragmentation of the left had already delivered Italy to Silvio Berlusconi and Umberto Bossi his unsavoury chum The Communists Trotskyists and Ecologists similarly gave Mr Le Pen his moment in France We can go on High unemployment and rising crime have long poisoned attitudes towards immigrants It was no accident that nearly half of the vote for Mr Le Pen came from the unemployed and pensioners September 11 reinforced the backlash against France's Islamic communities Globalisation has nurtured insecurity and sapped public confidence in Europe's ruling elites The European Union is seen as a further threat to national identity And of course as we gaze on these new faces of fascism we must not forget Europe's history There is something and nothing in such arguments We can put aside the daft ideas of those British Eurosceptics who seem to think that the far right has been rebuilt on the foundations of the EU's working time directive Each of the other explanations tells part of the story Taken together though they struggle to produce a convincing narrative They skim the surface but miss the deeper currents Mr Le Pen we know will be roundly defeated on May 5 by Jacques Chirac France and Europe will breathe a collective sigh of relief But the disconnection between rulers and ruled in France and beyond will endure Just as worrying as the rise of the right is an inexorable drift to disengagement Many more French voters abstained on Sunday than backed the National Front The same pattern can be observed across Europe as the chasm between politicians and citizens widens Apathy and extremism are two sides of the same coin I think this profound disenchantment among western Europe's electorates reflects a more enduring failure the misreading by mainstream parties of the meaning of the end of the cold war and their failure to face up to its consequences When the Berlin Wall came down more than a decade ago politicians of the right moderate left and centre simply cheered The west had won the defining ideological struggle of the 20th century Liberal democracy was the victor They could blow the peace dividend and settle down to the business of enjoying government occasionally swapping office for opposition but always within reach of the spoils of power Except of course that it was not quite like that The fall of the Soviet empire signalled the victory of market capitalism over the command economy The triumph was one of economics rather than of politics There was nothing in any of this guaranteed to entrench liberal democracy Quite the contrary The defeat of the Communist menace robbed European politics both of a common enemy and of the comfortable certainties of right and left With the ideological battle won and the west no longer under threat from the Soviet hordes the politicians lost their central purpose Simultaneously the left or most of it at last owned up to the fact that the state could not compete with the market The dividing lines between left and right were blurred Principle gave way to pragmatism The new politics promised managerialism in place of inspiration Mitterrand made way for Chirac Kohl for Schroder We should not be surprised that it has all seemed pretty hollow The complacency has extended beyond their domestic electorates Some will remember the heady rhetoric of 1989 Europe would be reunited The end of history would see peace and prosperity extend from the Atlantic to the Urals Politics would find its new purpose in the reconstruction of the broken nations of the former Soviet empire So we were told Instead the EU's approach to enlargement has been painfully slow and deliberately grudging The terms of eventual admission for the new democracies will reflect the same mean-spirited myopia Political leaders from Berlin to Rome from Paris to Madrid have colluded in the dangerous falsehood that the whole process is a zero-sum game that anything offered to the nations of central and eastern Europe is something subtracted from their own electorates For western Europe's citizens the consequences of the defeat of communism have thus seemed unremittingly bleak wars in the Balkans with the attendant influx of refugees and asylum-seekers illegal immigration from the former Soviet satellites organised crime and drug-smuggling And now it seems they will lose their EU subsidies and maybe their jobs to Poles and Czechs Hungarians and Slovaks Hardly a word has been uttered to make the compelling counter-case that everyone gains from the spread of prosperity and security that western Europe needs workers from the east that societies are enriched by immigration Should we wonder that the far right has found it easy to stir the embers of racism The immediate threat from Mr Le Pen and his like is to the parties of the centre-left The extreme right has always combined its xenophobia with a synthetic socialism tailored to the working poor The past two years have seen several electoral victories for the centre-right Some have self-consciously flirted with the language if not the policies of the extremists But parties of the centre-right are far from immune Apathy mass abstentions and the concomitant march of the nationalist right undermine the entire political process Mr Le Pen Jorg Haider in Austria Pia Kjaersgaard in Denmark Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands all challenge the essential values of liberal democracy The strength of these demagogues lies in the constant reassertion that they are in politics to change things Never mind that their policies are as phoney as they are repellent They have hijacked the politics of conviction To defeat them politicians of left and right alike must show that they too have a purpose beyond power philip

1998-04-01, Tony Blair the prime minister moved to head off a crisis in the Northern Ireland peace talks yesterday as major differences emerged over proposals for a devolved assembly for the province Amid signs the process may be faltering Mr Blair held discussions with John Hume leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party yesterday and is due to meet Bertie Ahern the Irish prime minister in London today to finalise the outline of a deal which the two governments hope to present to the parties later this week As the talks turned to the issue of the future governance of Northern Ireland nationalist politicians described unionist suggestions for a committee-style government for the province based on proportionality as little more than a glorified county council At the start of the day Mr Trimble broke with the convention of confidentiality governing the talks to lambast the cabinet-style government proposed by the SDLP Separately Mr Trimble was involved in a heated exchange with David Andrews the Irish foreign minister over the proposed amendments to Dublin's territorial claims over Northern Ireland Mr Trimble said to define the nation as all the people on the island and to define the territory as being the entire island is failing to recognise the existence of Northern Ireland As new fault lines emerged Mr Blair held separate telephone conversations with Lord Alderdice the Alliance leader and Gerry Adams the Sinn Fein president Downing Street said he would contact the two small loyalist parties later in the week A Downing Street spokesman said the discussions were part of the continuing process of taking forward the talks  The extent of the acrimony between the parties was underscored when Lord Alderdice who described the unionist proposals as unworkable and unrealistic accused Mr Trimble of negotiating through the media A SDLP spokesman said There were significant gaps between the parties It shouldn't be underestimated  In publicly airing his misgivings outside the talks Mr Trimble is adopting a hard line which officials fear will be difficult to step back from Mr Adams said later It is clear that the test of any agreement is whether it will be durable and this will only be possible if changes are substantial and deep-rooted  He said that while the public attention was on changes in the Irish constitutional claim over Northern Ireland the government must move to introduce real changes George Mitchell the former US senator chairing the talks yesterday outlined a schedule of meetings for the final push to a settlement Yesterday's spat over the form of an assembly will cast new doubts over whether the talks participants can meet the April 9 deadline set by George Mitchell ,3

2002-06-01, HIT Entertainment's attempt to add Thomas the Tank Engine to its stable of characters faltered yesterday after Gullane Entertaiment creator of the friendly blue engine issued an unexpected profit warning HIT which owns the rights to Barney the purple dinosaur and cherubic Bob the Builder announced it was reconsidering its offer of 500p a share It said In the light of that announcement the board of HIT Entertainment is considering whether to make an offer for Gullane and if so at what price  HIT's offer announced on May 27 would have valued Gullane at about £150m Earlier in the day Gullane warned that sales of the Guinness Book of World Records in the US had been slower than expected and that it would not close distribution and television production deals related to the book this financial year It said that sales and profits growth would be flat compared with last year a little over a month after it issued an optimistic interim trading statement Shares in Gullane which had risen sharply on hopes of a deal with HIT fell 35p to 437{1/2}p However the profit warning is unlikely to scupper the deal entirely HIT's latest bid represents its second attempt to buy Gullane Talks between the two collapsed in January 2000 over a disagreement on price At the time HIT was offering 750p a significant premium to its most recent offer HIT is interested in Gullane because characters such as Thomas the Tank Engine fit well into its line-up which is targeted at the pre-school market ,2
2002-06-15, It is of course commerciallyexpedient to have a vintage with three neat round noughts in it to sell A cynic might therefore have approached samples of the 2000 vintage ports just released with a whiff of scepticism But nature has undoubtedly done its stuff producing a small crop of very concentrated ripe wines The port trade is every bit as justified in making a fuss about its 2000 vintage as its counterpart in Bordeaux even if it may find rather fewer eager buyers My tasting of almost 40 examples at least once and many of them twice suggests that the vintage produced at least 15 truly fine wines albeit in several different styles perhaps more than there used to be A big new factor in shaping the style of vintage port to come seems to be a strange-sounding thing called a robotic lagar A lagar is the Portuguese word for the shallow granite troughs in which port grapes have traditionally been trodden by foot one of the port trade's most folkloric offerings to visitors to the region at vintage time All grapes have to be crushed before they will yield wine so that yeast can get at the sugars within The port trade has expended considerable ingenuity over the years in developing alternatives to the expensive time-consuming but undoubtedly effective foot-treading In the 1960s when producers first ran short of labour they borrowed a technique called autovinification from Algeria which extracted maximum colour in a short time without needing electricity which was at that time unreliable in the Douro Valley where all port is made Today they seek a substitute that will make wines that are just as good or better than those made by foot Two Anglo-Portuguese groupings dominate the fine port trade The Symington Family Port Companies produce all that is sold under the names Graham Dow Warre Smith Woodhouse Quarles Harris Gould Campbell Quinta de Roriz and Quinta do Vesuvio and many more besides The grouping now known as The Fladgate Partnership since it recently acquired Croft and Delaforce also makes Taylor Fonseca and some own- label ports Each has come up with its own modern replacement for the human foot the Fladgate Partnership has a series of piston plungers in sloping-bottomed tanks and the Syms a robotic lagar just like the old lagares but with robots instead of humans doing the hard work and offering control over the temperature a refinement unknown in foot treading I have seen neither at work but on the basis of what I have tasted I would say that the robotic lagar has made a particularly delicious impact Both the Symington vintage ports with a significant proportion of grapes crushed by robotic lagares Graham 36 per cent and Dow 25 per cent were stunning but in a rather different way to traditional young vintage port Both obviously had massive charges of tannin the natural preservative needed to sustain vintage port through what is to be hoped will be a very long life but the quality of the tannins was distinctive They were so ripe and gentle that it seemed to me both these ports even the traditionally rather austere Dow could be drunk with pleasure at a much earlier stage than most of their peers I should add that I came to this conclusion while tasting the wines blind among a range of 38 not an exercise with British Dental Association approval so there was no auto-suggestion here However I should perhaps further add that when I got to the Smith Woodhouse in this blind tasting I was also wrongly convinced that it was some robotic lagar effect that linked it to the Graham instead of the simple Symington effect The flagship wines of the rival group also showed well Fonseca much better when not tasted blind but seemed much sterner This of course is much closer to the traditional stereotype of a young vintage port For port's oldest devotees the presence of a gustatory steel girder is paramount and pleasure should not come into the picture for at least two decades But if vintage port is to make any appeal to a new generation of drinkers the ones whom Paul Symington one of a line of suits at the launch of his company's 2000s was presumably so desperate to convince that these wines are incredibly sexy it may well benefit from the robotic lagar effect These are wines for enjoyment not investment ,2

2002-06-15, Managers of the Szczecin shipyard decided to file for bankruptcy yesterday in what could become post-Communist Poland's biggest business failure The move came after some of the privately controlled yard's creditors refused to endorse a government-led rescue plan that would have required them to write down the shipbuilder's debt by 80 per cent News of the plan had sent shares in Poland's banks downwards on the Warsaw exchange this week The shipyard will formally end composition talks with banks and file for bankruptcy in Szczecin on Monday said Marek Molewicz a marketing specialist with the group Bankruptcy would allow the yard to stop servicing its debt as it seeks ways to continue building existing ships on order Mr Molewicz added The crisis in the port city near Poland's border with Germany is a headache for Leszek Miller's careworn leftwing government and a blow to an economy with an unemployment rate of 17 2 per cent As many as 60000 jobs are now in the balance including the yard's 6000 staff and positions at suppliers around Poland Angry workers outside the company's headquarters pelted Jacek Piechota economics minister with eggs after he emerged to report on talks with the yard's management and a worker-led protest committee Mr Piechota said that construction of some ships could continue at either one of the holding's existing companies or a new one recapitalised with $40m guaranteed by the state-run Industrial Development Agency Zbigniew Karkota chairman of the yard's holding company told workers who have not been paid since March that they would receive their back wages from a taxpayer-funded wage-guarantee fund An industrial showpiece and hotbed of the Solidarity movement under Communism the 52-year-old yard was privatised in a management-led buyout in the 1990s Poor financial management combined with slowing market demand and the strong zloty prompted banks to cut off lending to Szczecin last year Fearful of the mass job losses that a bankruptcy would bring the government stepped in last month with a pledge to renationalise the yard currently about 10 per cent owned by the state But due diligence turned up new financial problems at the complexly structured holding and some banks balked at reducing the shipbuilder's debt without a viable restructuring plan in place This is unfortunate because other companies in Poland will go bankrupt said Bogdan Wyznikiewicz vice-president with the Gdansk Institute for Market Economics However he added This was the only possible solution It should have been done much earlier ,2
1998-04-02, It is not hard to come across the Yes campaign for an elected London mayor and assembly Yesterday Tony Blair was at a glitzy launch on board HMS Belfast urging Londoners to back the overhaul of government in the capital The second world war cruiser complete with its fearsome battery of big guns was an appropriate place to launch what will one of the most one-sided electoral contests in British political history While the Yes campaign is backed by Mr Blair William Hague and Paddy Ashdown and the collective might of the three main parties the No campaign is considerably harder to track down It is not even called the No campaign We didn't want to call it that it sounded too negative says Simon Fawthrop one of a determined band determined to oppose the creation of a London-wide authority Instead Mr Fawthrop and his colleagues have set up a group called Communities 1st which will oppose Mr Blair's cross-party Westminster alliance from the leafy glades of suburban Kent The 34-year-old BT business analyst is approaching his task with an endearing boyish enthusiasm His campaign has hardly any money but claims to have the backing of about 1000 like-minded activists scattered around the capital Many of the No campaigners like Mr Fawthrop are Conservatives who have remained true to their belief that London does not need a capital-wide authority Lady Thatcher would be proud of them The former prime minister abolished the Greater London Council in 1986 dispersing power around the city to its constituent 32 boroughs Those Tories who believe she was right have been left high and dry by Mr Hague who has decided to join the political throng campaigning for a Yes vote He has concluded that the Conservatives could actually win a few seats on the new Greater London Authority and even the mayoralty itself It could be counter-productive if the Tories were to try to strangle the new arrangements at birth Mr Fawthrop chairman of Communities 1st is having none of it A former Conservative councillor in Lambeth he and his colleagues are handing out leaflets arguing that London can do without a new centralised authority His campaign is being run from Chelsfield a community which the Post Office classifies as being in Kent even though it has been subsumed into the London Borough of Bromley And that is a clue to the motivation behind the campaign Mr Fawthrop believes London is not a homogeneous mass but a collection of individual communities absorbed by the growing metropolis London isn't a planned city he says It has grown out of lots of small villages and towns People understand those communities and their interests are best reflected by the borough councils  Mr Hague has not bothered trying to bring his errant colleagues into line it is quite possible he has not even heard of them Even the Department of Environment which is organising the referendum has trouble locating the No campaign The No campaign is likely to operate on a budget of less than £10000 against a Yes budget which Mr Fawthrop estimates will run in excess of £1 5m He claims the most effective publicity for a No vote is being provided by the likely candidates for London mayor including Red Ken Livingstone and Lord Archer They are doing a great job for us he says If people don't want those people to be mayor of London the best way to stop them is by voting No on May 7 ,3
2002-04-05, Richard Pym chief executive-elect of Alliance & Leicester is so bored of being asked when the former building society will be taken over he no longer bothers answering the question himself Instead he picks up the annual results and reads out the now standard line set out by John Windeler executive chairman We have consistently said we have a duty to consider serious offers for the business should any occur which clearly represent superior returns to our shareholders  The bank has been the centre of takeover speculation since it listed nearly five years ago But this month is a critical moment as its protection against unwanted bids granted for five years at flotation ends In theory this opens the door for hostile bids and has helped drive the share price to 895p the highest for more than two years In practice nothing is likely to change There are banks that could benefit from owning A&L analysts put the savings from a takeover at up to £225m but most are either unable to buy because of competition concerns or unwilling to pay the current price which includes a chunky takeover premium Abbey National the most likely buyer has troubles of its own a purchase at a hefty price would not please shareholders who would prefer it to focus on bad debts at its wholesale bank Overtures from Lloyds TSB Barclays or Royal Bank of Scotland would prompt competition concerns and none has any strategic need for a mid-sized UK bank National Australia Bank which needs to increase its UK operations has troubles of its own and would find it hard to launch a hostile attack with foreign-listed shares And Bank of Ireland is unlikely to want to renew talks with A&L after the very public failure of the merger attempt in 1999 All of which leaves Mr Pym happy to predict that A&L can remain independent indefinitely We have got plenty of capital we are well funded we don't see any constraints he said We think we have a winning strategy  Shareholders have been highly sceptical not least because the strategy kept changing The bank fired its chief executive two years ago and dropped his replacement Peter McNamara last year It also abandoned a 6 per cent compound revenue growth target in favour of an easier 4 per cent and has moved its target customer group downmarket However some investors are being won round to the bank's point of view What has helped is A&L's success in the final quarter last year the best period of revenue growth since it came to the market and meeting its cost-cutting targets It is also a defensive stock with no exposure to the global corporate lending that caused such pain at its larger rivals This combined with the chunky dividend which puts it on an estimated yield of 4 3 per cent this year led Morgan Stanley to predict it had turned a corner There is no doubt that Mr Pym has a spring in his step There is a real feeling that staff know what we are doing and they agree with it This is an organisation that has got a high degree of confidence about its future  A&L is pinning its hopes on cross-selling increasing the number of products sold to each customer As a result it is breaking with banking tradition and giving existing customers better deals than new customers in an attempt to create loyalty It is also concentrating on just four key products to attract customers current and savings accounts personal loans and mortgages Other areas including the credit card division are secondary and could be sold or outsourced The aim is to stop trying to be a miniature copy of banking groups such as Lloyds TSB or Barclays and concentrate on ensuring the four core products are attractive to the mass market not to the upmarket groups that were being targeted The strategic shifts have gone down well with many shareholders But targets look likely to be missed A&L is aiming to boost its share of the small business market to 10 per cent by 2005 and even the Competition Commission argues this is implausible Mr Pym has not yet formally abandoned hopes of hitting this target But it seems clear that he no longer seriously expects such a rapid increase from its existing 0 5 per cent share I'm never going to give up on the target but we only have to go part of the way and we will have created a lot of value Let's not get hidebound by targets we want to be a lot bigger  Few will be surprised if the target is quietly dropped But when a takeover offer arrives and it seems to be when rather than if it will be one more piece of ammunition for a buyer seeking to discredit the bank ,2
2002-06-27, The dollar's rollercoaster ride continued yesterday as it hit new 28-month lows against the euro only to recover by more than a cent as investors took profits Wall Street remained the key and the dollar fell sharply overnight after US telecoms group WorldCom said on Tuesday it had fired its chief financial officer over a suspected $3 8bn fraud Enron WorldCom these accounting concerns are doing massive psychological damage to foreigners considering holding US assets said Lara Rhame vice-president of foreign exchange research at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York The news helped push the euro to $0 9944 yesterday from $0 9787 at the close of Wall Street trading the day before But the single currency eased after a sharply lower open for US equities failed to take it to parity with the dollar and it stood at $0 987 by midsession in New York The Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates on hold caused little immediate stir The key Fed funds rate remained at 1 75 per cent a 40-year low The decision was priced into the market and even the accompanying statement received less attention than usual in the wake of WorldCom's revelations  The Bank of Japan intervened again yesterday the sixth such move in five weeks According to analysts' estimates the bank has bought an estimated $31bn for yen over the period yet seen the yen strengthen more than 4 per cent to an eight-month high at Y118 94 despite its actions But analysts do not necessarily regard the Bank's lack of success in weakening the yen as failure What the BoJ has succeeded in doing is creating a slightly more orderly market said David Bloom currencies strategist at HSBC They know they can't fight the world on their own but I'd hate to think of where the rate would be without that $31bn  While Japan's hefty reserves can withstand the intervention to date there is a danger the BoJ's moves could become self-defeating warned Mr Bloom If the BoJ keeps coming in there's a danger people see the opportunity to make free money by selling dollars to the BoJ then buying them back as the rate falls further he said  Comments by George W Bush US president overnight were an important factor behind the dollar's slide yesterday President Bush told reporters in Canada the dollar will seek its level based upon market forces He said that the currency's level would ultimately depend upon whether or not our country can rein in spending can recover can revitalise our manufacturing base The news supported a growing belief that the US administration welcomed the weaker dollar and was quietly trying to bury the oft-repeated strong dollar mantra The president's comments gave a green light to dollar bears said Neil Mackinnon chief economist at the currency debt management group ECU They confirmed suspicions that the dollar is not a priority for this administration  The problem with the president's comments is that they come as the dollar's slide gathers pace and a green light to sell could help spark a rash of further selling which could spiral out of control From its January 31 high against the euro at $0 8582 to yesterday's $0 9944 high the dollar's slide has appeared relatively gradual equivalent to 0 09 of a US cent per day But in the last 10 days that pace has picked up and the dollar has fallen about half a cent a day The other problem is the market's attitude to the Bush administration If the market doesn't believe a government is concerned with or would firmly handle a growing currency crisis then selling could easily gather further pace This administration hasn't been very credible in the market's eyes it has put forth policies like steel import tariffs which the market doesn't like said Ms Rhame at Brown Brothers Harriman There isn't a whole lot of trust between this administration and the markets  If the pace of the dollar's slide picks up what trust exists could be tested in the days ahead ,2
2002-06-10, Denmark is a windy country with few fossil-fuel resources and a keen interest in preserving the environment So it may be no surprise that it punches above its weight when it comes to wind-energy companies The country has two of the three biggest suppliers of wind turbines the publicly quoted Vestas and NEG Micon It is also home to a member of a second league of wind energy companies in the shape of the privately-owned Bonus Both Vestas and NEG have grown substantially in the past 10 years on the back of increased interest in ways of producing electricity using renewable resources While Denmark provided the initial impetus for both companies' growth both have become international businesses with sales operations around the world Of the various alternative energy technologies wind systems are frequently highlighted as having the most promising immediate prospects Wind turbines account for about 25GW of power output less than 1 per cent of the world's total electricity supply installations However many believe new installations could expand by 20 to 25 per cent a year in the next few years with the costs of producing electricity from the free supply of energy from the wind having dropped dramatically in the past decade so they are now broadly comparable with those of producing electricity from fossil fuels New credibility has been lent to the cause of wind energy after the purchase of the wind energy division of Enron the bankrupt US electricity trader by General Electric the world's biggest power equipment compnay That means GE has become the first of the large generating makers to become a fully-fledged supplier of wind systems Enron's wind division was before its demise the world's fourth biggest in this technology followed by Gamesa of Spain The second sandwiched between the two Danish companies is Enercon a private German company Both Vestas and NEG are run by executives with a financial background Svend Sigaard a former auditor stepped up to become chief executive at Vestas in April after 15 years as chief financial officer Torben Bjerre-Madsen has been president of NEG since late 1999 when he was recruited to sort out a series of management and financial problems that stemmed from over-rapid growth in the previous two years Mr Sigaard believes that this year Vestas can push up sales to {XEU}1 6bn from {XEU}1 3bn last year He reckons it should earn an underlying profit margin on earnings before interest tax and depreciation of 10 per cent above average for the engineering industry Last year Vestas was responsible for about a quarter of the world's installations of new wind energy systems which accounted for power output of 6 8GW This year he thinks wind installations will be 25 per cent higher at 8 5GW and next year will rise again to 11GW At NEG Mr Bjerre-Madsen is less optimistic about the immediate future He thinks new wind installations during 2002 might grow only 10 to 15 per cent with much depending on the state of demand in the US where much of the growth in the industry has taken place in the past two years but where expansion may be slowing Last year NEG's sales came to {XEU}716m on which it made a pre-tax profit of {XEU}37m Both Mr Sigaard and Mr Bjerre-Madsen are happy to confront one frequently voiced argument against wind power When the wind does not blow even the most technologically advanced wind turbine is useless It is true that you cannot rely 100 per cent on a wind system says Mr Sigaard However you have to relate the use of wind energy to the overall requirements of the electricity grid As long as you have adequate generating capacity from other sources and ensure that wind energy is no more than 20 to 30 per cent of the total wind turbines have a valid role to play  Mr Bjerre-Madsen says electricity planners are becoming increasingly sophisticated about countering this issue for instance through siting wind turbines in places which are statistically likely to have the best chances of seeing high winds Also new forecasting techniques are making it possible to assess when winds are likely to be strongest during times of the day when production of electricity into the grid using conventional power stations can be reduced Another objection is that some people just do not like the look of wind turbines which they say ruin the countryside Both Mr Bjerre-Madsen and Mr Sigaard say this argument can be countered by careful planning sometimes involving siting new wind parks offshore and better designs which ensure the blades of wind turbines move less quickly and so appear less obtrusive Peter Marsh,2
2002-04-16, Volvo the Swedish industrial vehicles group yesterday expressed cautious optimism that an upturn was under way in the North American truck market adding that the downturn in Europe was proving to be less severe than feared Leif Johansson Volvo chief executive said We have seen an upturn in orders for both heavy trucks and construction equipment in North America in the past few weeks It's a matter of a few percentage points  He was speaking a day after Volvo celebrated its 75th birthday with a party at its Gothenburg headquarters Both Volvo and Volvo Cars the latter has been owned by Ford since 1999 were involved in the celebrations The North American heavy truck market has proved disastrous for truckmakers in the past two years After peaking at 309000 deliveries in 1999 the market collapsed to 170000 deliveries last year Volvo alone saw its North American sales slump 34 per cent last year Mr Johansson said it was too early to say whether the upturn would prove durable This is not booming This is bottoming out and perhaps slightly increasing he said However observers said his comments were more optimistic than those given at Volvo's capital markets day last month Mr Johansson also said that Volvo was doing better than its competitors after overhauling its product range last year In Europe there was also cause for some optimism he said Europe is still coming down but it is not coming down so dramatically as we expected  Analysts expect the European heavy truck market to shrink by 10-15 per cent this year The fate of Volvo's 30 7 per cent voting stake in Scania the Swedish truckmaking rival it was prevented from buying two years ago by the European Commission remains uncertain The Commission has ordered Volvo to sell its stake or distribute it to shareholders before 2004 at the latest Volkswagen of Germany acquired a significant voting stake in Scania two years ago but it is far from clear whether it intends to move to take full control The result is that ownership uncertainty continues to dog Scania Mr Johansson said We have few options as Volvo to say 'no' to a reasonable offer  He said the group was hoping to receive more than its average purchase price of SKr265 per Scania share But analysts believe he may have to sell at a loss given Scania's current share price Scania shares closed unchanged at SKr195 50 Mr Johansson said Volvo hoped to get the go-ahead to start truck production in China in conjunction with the state-owned China National Heavy Trucks group Discussions have been taking place since 1998 I would like to see us make an agreement in the next six months I am optimistic about that but I have been optimistic for the past four years he stated The Chinese authorities have been reluctant to give the go-ahead to any truck manufacturing deal involving a foreign truckmaker fearing the potential impact on the domestic industry and jobs ,1
2002-06-12, Bankruptcies in Hong Kong in the first five months of this year nearly trebled compared with the same period in 2001 deepening concerns over the longer-term health of the territory's economy Rising unemployment and economic recession are also expected to push the numbers higher in the coming months analysts said after the government said bankruptcies rose to 8104 between January and May compared with 2738 during the same period a year earlier and a record 9151 for the whole of 2001 We don't expect unemployment to start coming down anytime soon so we don't expect the bankruptcy numbers to start coming down anytime soon either said Keith Irving head of Asia-Pacific financials research with Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong The figures are the starkest indication yet of the structural slowdown under way in Hong Kong's domestic economy as it wrestles with its second recession in five years Unemployment has hit a record high of 7 1 per cent while gross domestic product shrank 0 9 per cent in the first quarter Declining revenues caused the government's budget deficit in the last fiscal year to surge to HK$63 3bn $8bn compared with an original estimate of HK$3bn The global economic slowdown is behind the territory's latest recession But Hong Kong's domestic economy has never fully recovered from the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 The territory's export sector emerged relatively intact but its once mighty property market is languishing at half the levels of 1997 Deflation sparked by the crisis is now in its 43rd month Over the past two years the weak real estate market and low corporate demand for loans has prompted banks to begin aggressively pushing credit cards These remain profitable but bad-debt write-offs have risen sharply in line with the number of personal bankruptcies Mr Irving said the net charge for bad debts at Hang Seng Bank the territory's second largest listed bank could double this year leading to a 5 per cent fall in net profit a situation that is likely to be replicated throughout the sector This problem rising bankruptcies has come immediately after a period when the banks have grown their unsecured consumer lending very aggressively so it's kind of a double whammy said Mr Irving The banks blame the government's decision in 1998 to reduce the rehabilitation period for bankrupt people to four years from eight which they say has encouraged people to resort to bankruptcy to avoid their debts They are pressing the government for the right to share consumer credit information in a bid to reduce future charge offs www ft com/asiapacific,2

2002-04-10, A two-day meeting between Afghanistan's interim administration and international donors begins in Kabul today amid efforts to speed the flow of funds to the country's cash-strapped authorities A positive result is crucial to a government facing growing security concerns and to assuaging complaints that external pledges of $1 8bn for this year have been slow to materialise Afghans have high hopes and expectations that the money pledged will be spent soon and wisely said a pre-conference statement issued by presidential adviser Ashraf Ghani Unless there are quick results hope could fast turn to frustration and disappointment  The government will present its recently prepared budget which one official said amounted to significantly less than earlier estimates of $600m £422m The official said 40 per cent would be spent on salaries including those of soldiers 40 per cent on equipment including textbooks for schools and 20 per cent on extraordinary items The interim administration will seek commitment from donors to fund the budget so as to allow Afghanistan predictability of financing and a return to normality said the statement Donors and the authorities alike are convinced that security remains a priority following an assassination attempt on the defence minister an alleged coup plot and a rocket attack on the international security force There are serious concerns about the number of unpaid soldiers most of whom will not be absorbed by a proposed national army border guard and police force totalling 150000 The United Nations yesterday reported factional fighting on the border with Iran adding that thousands of returning refugees had been held up on the border with Pakistan The fighting came as Iran and the UN refugee agency started a programme yesterday to repatriate some of the roughly 2m Afghan refugees inside Iran In western Afghanistan rival warlords struggled for control of lucrative border security posts threatening to stall attempts to return refugees from Iran No refugees crossed the border at Zaranj yesterday because of the fighting the UNHCR said But at Iran's northern border crossing with Afghanistan at Islam Qala 146 Afghans returned home and thousands more queued in Tehran to register for the assisted repatriation programme The return of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees from Pakistan also largely ground to a halt after farmers pelted cars with stones in protest at government plans to stop them growing poppies used to make opium and heroin ,3
2002-06-15, Tobacco consolidation Smoke signals from the tobacco sector are suggesting a further round of consolidation in an already much merged industry Recent speculation has centred on the possibility of a 900p a share bid by British American Tobacco for Gallaher valuing the target at £5 8bn BAT is under-represented in the UK and continental Europe while a clampdown on advertising in developed country markets has put a premium on international brands Savings can also be made by giving sales forces a broader range of products to sell Finance is not a problem because many of the tobacco groups are awash with cash BAT has made no secret of its desire for further acquisitions but Philip Morris in the US and Japan Tobacco are also potential buyers Likely targets apart from Gallaher include Altadis the Spanish-French group Smaller less strategically compelling buys can be found among a swathe of soon-to-be-privatised companies in countries including South Korea Italy and Bulgaria Until recently tobacco has been one of those rare sectors where the scale of synergies has meant bidders' shareholders have benefited as much as those of the target But the vertiginous rise of European tobacco stocks outperforming the Eurotop 300 by 110 per cent in the past 18 months is putting a strain on the numbers The shortage of bid targets with an international spread is also pushing up prices The strategic reasons for further consolidation remain compelling but the financial case is becoming harder to argue No one wants to be seen to do a deal at the top of the market ,2
2002-06-17, Slawomir Wiatr a slick 48-year-old businessman with a big advertising budget is leading the government's campaign for European Union accession Ranged against him is Roman Giertych a 31-year-old leader of the League of Polish Families the small right-wing party which is alone among parliamentary groupings in declaring its complete opposition to EU membership Mr Wiatr starts with the backing of the government machine most of the intellectual elite the media and business leaders Yet it is the tough-talking Mr Giertych who has made the stronger impression since the two men started campaigning in earnest a month ago His television appearances are marked with a passion which pro-accession spokesmen including Mr Wiatr seem to lack The pro-EU forces are in a tricky position They command a big majority in parliament with the SLD the dominant partner in the ruling coalition and the Civic Platform the biggest opposition grouping both staunch supporters of accession The powerful Roman Catholic Church the main newspapers and big business are all on their side So is about 60 per cent of the public after a recent modest increase The anti-EU campaigners secure between 20 and 25 per cent in opinion polls with other respondents undecided But the government must choose its words with care because it is locked in ever more intense negotiations with the EU over membership terms With the key issue of farm policy unlikely to be decided before the year-end there is still much to do at the negotiating table Ministers who want to convince Brussels that the terms now on offer are unacceptable cannot simultaneously urge them upon the Polish population Mr Giertych and his supporters have seized their chance Until about a year ago most opposition to accession was limited to vague emotional language about defending Poland's identity against the western onslaught Now with the negotiations increasingly concentrated upon issues of hard cash the anti-accession lobby has added financial arguments to its campaign Spokesmen argue for example that Poland's accumulated trade deficit with the EU of $10bn in the last decade amounts to a $10bn loss The claim may be spurious but it succeeds in sowing distrust of the EU Much is at stake Leszek Miller the prime minister says that winning the referendum by a few percentage points is not enough A handsome victory is required to show that the country is united on accession Andrzej Rychard head of social studies at the Polish Academy of Sciences says that although supporters of accession clearly outnumber opponents undecided voters could still upset the results He notes one recent positive trend a decoupling of support for the EU which has risen from support for the government which has fallen This could indicate that people are really beginning to believe the EU can solve problems which the government cannot but it is too soon to be sure says Mr Rychard EU fans are strongest in the big cities The opposition is concentrated in small towns and the countryside EU supporters tend to be younger better-educated and more prosperous than their opponents But there is a notable exception Among farmers opposition to the union is strongest among larger commercial producers people who fear they have most to lose from joining the Common Agricultural Policy They are afraid that Poland's markets will be swamped by cheap imports from heavily subsidised EU farmers These Polish farmers are among the most enthusiastic supporters of Andrzej Lepper the populist leader who is himself a commercial farmer Mr Lepper has not categorically ruled out accession but insists it can only be acceptable if the entry conditions are dramatically improved By contrast poorer farmers are less hostile to the EU perhaps because of the Catholic Church's support Danuta Hubner the EU integration minister says the government must do more to inform farmers about the benefits of accession in terms of EU rural development funds This message fails to penetrate because of the bigger farmers' focus on agriculture per se A key influence will be the course of negotiations Like other candidate states Poland has persuaded the European Commission that it cannot start out as a net contributor to the EU budget This might happen if the EU stuck rigidly to its financing rules because some funds such as infrastructure finance take time to disburse But Brussels has promised that the new members will receive at least as much as they now get in pre-accession aid This is important politically because a net loss on entry would be a gift to the antis Without an acceptable deal on farm aid the government coalition could break apart with the junior partner the Polish Peasant Party PSL abandoning the SLD If the PSL combines with Mr Lepper and Mr Giertych to oppose accession the pro-EU lobby would face a tough fight Barbara Radziejowska a rural affairs expert at the Polish Academy of Sciences says a powerful cry to protect the countryside could find an echo in the cities since 60 per cent of urban Poles have rural roots The decisions in the countryside could be decisive she says As well as the negotiations economic developments could be crucial If growth recovers next year to about 3 per cent as the government has forecast and unemployment stops rising above its current 18 per cent level Poles could become more optimistic about their future and more trusting in their pro-EU political elite But even then they are unlikely to vote for accession with any great enthusiasm The referendum may be a rather serious affair ,3
2002-04-20, NTL and its main bondholders yesterday rejected a new bid from John Malone the US media mogul who has been stalking the crisis-stricken cable company Mr Malone and Liberty Media his investment vehicle are understood to have offered $500m £347m in cash for 100 per cent of Cablecom NTL's heavily indebted Swiss subsidiary They also want NTL's consent to buy enough bonds to give it 30 per cent of the company's core UK and Ireland unit in any debt-for-equity swap Although NTL which this week agreed a record $10 6bn debt-for-equity swap with its bondholders has rejected the approach Liberty is continuing to target banks The rescue cannot succeed without their approval At least one bank last night welcomed Liberty's interest suggesting Mr Malone may yet find a way into the restructuring talks from which he has been excluded Liberty is prevented from talking directly to NTL's banks or bondholders by an agreement it has with the cable company until July It made the offer in writing to Barclay Knapp NTL's chief executive It is thought that Liberty valued NTL considerably below the $10 5bn total enterprise value that underpins the restructuring plan The NTL board and its main bondholder group quickly rejected Liberty's price as too low Malone is still trying to get the company on the cheap said one person close to the situation Liberty was rebuffed last month when it offered buy NTL bonds Now it has moved Cablecom and its banks centre-stage to its pitch While NTL bondholders have largely written off Cablecom the Swiss unit is a crunch issue for many NTL banks and threatens to unravel the rescue plan Cablecom has breached covenants on its $2bn of loans It could have to file for insolvency by the end of the month unless it is granted new short-term bank waivers To survive longer term it must receive new cash or see some of its loans written off according to bondholders and debt analysts Its banks which include JP Morgan Chase Morgan Stanley Bank of America and dozens of others are facing a total write-off of at least several hundred millions of dollars according to some Bondholders do not want to provide new cash but the banks are resisting any write-off They want new funding for Cablecom as a condition of agreeing the overall debt restructuring plan at NTL They argue this cash could come from either bondholders or the $300m proceeds from the sale of NTL's Australian network Talks between NTL management and its banks continue Any delay could undermine NTL's plan to file for Chapter 11 by the end of April While the banks have not had the chance to evaluate Liberty's offer we are not disappointed the offer has been made one said ,1

2002-04-19, President Vladimir Putin yesterday used his annual speech to parliament to issue a stern warning that Russia's possibilities in world economics and politics will contract unless it can increase its economic growth rate The comments coupled with other criticisms of the government yesterday for failing to improve healthcare or to streamline bureaucracy increased speculation that Mr Putin would soon reshuffle his government He has made few changes to the government led by Mikhail Kasyanov prime minister since he was elected president two years ago Mr Putin criticised his government for its medium-term forecast of a 3 5-4 6 per cent annual growth rate This was not helpful and did not imply an active policy he said He blamed a cumbersome clumsy and ineffective state apparatus for limiting Russia's growth potential He said it needed a more compact more open and less interventionist bureaucracy In a speech yesterday Mr Putin's main message was that Russia had to take full responsibility for its success or failure No one is going to war with us in the modern world   but no one is really waiting for us either no one will help us specially he said We have to fight for our place in the economic sun  But he gave no specific targets for the size or the timing of the changes he wanted a failing that other politicians identified as a general weakness of the wide-ranging but cautious policy speech There are no concrete parameters in terms of timing or quantity for dealing with any of the problems he identifies whether in economic reform military reform judicial reform or anything else said Boris Nadezhdin a centre-right parliamentarian Mr Putin first pressed his ministers for ideas on raising Russia's growth rate after reviewing the government's medium-term strategy last week He has observed publicly that at last year's 5 per cent growth rate Russia would need another 18 years to reach the living standards of Portugal today Mr Putin repeated his calls for Russia to join the World Trade Organisation He said Russia was already in world trade but with no say in shaping the rules of world trade He said companies that wanted to sit behind a fence of protectionists quotas were absolutely doomed strategically Foreign policy occupied only a small part of the speech despite Russia's dramatic shift to a more pro-western position since September 11 Mr Putin said Russia's foreign policy was purely pragmatic Its main partners in the world remained the ex-Soviet countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States Work with these countries was a main foreign policy priority of Russia he said Other priorities included permanent dialogue with the US better relations with Nato and the creation of a single economic state for trade and investment with the European Union ,3
2002-04-01, India yesterday scrapped almost all quantitative restrictions on exports part of a five-year strategy to boost its share of world trade and double exports to more than $80bn £56bn {XEU}90bn by 2007 Murasoli Maran commerce and industry minister said India needed radical action to raise its share of global trade from 0 67 per cent to 1 per cent over five years Mr Maran said export trade for the current year had been terrible and he was unsure if India would meet its 3 per cent export growth target for 2001/02 even though it had been revised from 12 per cent in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks in the US Winning 1 per cent of world trade would need a compound growth rate of 11 9 per cent over five years from the current level of $46bn said Mr Maran To achieve this we should wake up from the stupor of export fatalism    and employ international trade as an engine for growth  Despite recent setbacks in regional elections and a political backlash following the communal violence in Gujarat the BJP-led coalition government has tried to push ahead with reforms to revive economic growth which is expected to be 5 4 per cent this year The central plank of its latest five-year trade plan is the removal of all quantitative restrictions on exports except for a few sensitive product areas The biggest impact will be in India's agricultural sector which provides income to 70 per cent of households The government said it would cut red tape to allow farmers to boost exports of grains oils cashew nuts and butter It would also provide aid for transporting goods a move which Mr Maran said was within World Trade Organisation rules Action was also unveiled to galvanise India's special economic zones SEZs set up in 2000 to copy the success story of China's SEZs India's model has been less successful In a bid to respond to calls for greater freedom for the SEZs Mr Maran said special tax breaks would be provided to SEZ businesses In a further effort to become competitive India will give incentives to the IT hardware sector which is lagging behind India's booming software industry a rare export success story The framework was welcomed by industry leaders who had been concerned that economic liberalisation could be derailed by the BJP's political troubles Amit Mitra of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said Without removal of these restrictions you can't have a big boost in exports ,3
2002-04-30, Listening to thecommotion across Europe about Jean-Marie Le Pen a stranger might suppose he had won 71 per cent of the French vote instead of 17 There is no sinister wave of rightwing extremism sweeping away our democratic landmarks There is genuine concern about crime and immigration spasmodic-ally exploited by extremists In Britain the British National Party has modest hopes of election success in one or two northern towns In Germany Ronald Schill who exploited the issue of crime in last year's Hamburg election sputtered out this month in Saxony-Anhalt This is not big stuff The lesson from the French election is that the electorate has developed a distaste for the conventional parties and their leaders Most French voters either stayed at home or voted for eccentric candidates because they were not Lionel Jospin or Jacques Chirac The same distaste is evident across Europe l'Europe s'ennuie  Boredom is not the worst political disease politicians ought not to be excessively adored or hated But it can go too far As the big political parties of Europe have converged the level of popular interest and trust in the political process has fallen dangerously low That is a real challenge to those like myself with centrist and consensual instincts The French will elect Mr Chirac and perhaps in June an Assembly somewhat inclined to the left Having miscalculated the effect of their votes in the first round this clever electorate may restore the balance even if it means more cohabitation The next crucial test will come in Germany in September Lacking so far any great division with his rival on policy Edmund Stoiber Germany's opposition candidate will make a virtue of the difference of personality between Gerhard Schroder the incumbent and himself He does not shine on television but is thorough and hardworking and owes nothing to the trade unions He will invite the electorate to contrast these qualities with the spin showmanship and deference to the unions shown by Mr Schroder The contrast between substance and glamour enabled George W Bush to succeed Bill Clinton and will one day give Iain Duncan Smith a chance against Tony Blair The difference is that Mr Bush governed Texas and Mr Stoiber governs Bavaria with a success beyond the reach of an opposition leader in our centralised system Yet a crucial political theme in both France and Germany is crying out for attention Are those two peoples willing to accept lower individual prosperity and higher unemployment as the price for maintaining their present social and agricultural systems Or would they without breathing the word Anglo-Saxon prefer reforms that would liberate individual and corporate energy but arguably gamble with social stability The liberal Free Democrats in Germany are the only sizeable force advocating such reform That is why the best result for Europe in the German election would be a CDU-FDP coalition In France the most effective advocate of structural reform is not a politician but the governor of the Bank of France Jean-Claude Trichet would do a more important job for Europe as prime minister of France than as the next president of the European Central Bank The odd consequence is that the leader for economic reform in continental Europe is now Spain followed by Italy In Britain once New Labour had accepted the main Thatcher/Major reforms that particular argument was settled William Hague chose Europe as his main challenge to the government but it flopped The Conservatives have now bravely turned to the public services But this does not mark a fundamental difference of philosophy with Labour The Conservatives are not arguing that less should be spent but that pouring new money into the old structures will not work This dearth of fundamental political division creates a dilemma for the Conservatives Of course they will concentrate on the growing total of Labour mistakes But if they return to shrill automatic denunciation of every Labour decision they will be identified with mindless adversarial politics That is why thoughtful Conservatives such as Francis Maude probe deeper and argue for humbler more local dialogue between politicians and people Oliver Letwin and David Willetts shadow cabinet members want to equip the Tories with a fresh vocabulary as the champions of a neighbourly society that does not depend for its dynamics on government rules This is vague stuff beginning to take intelligent shape Precisely because they are technically in the weakest political position the British Conservatives may be undertaking a deeper rethink of their approach than their counterparts on the Continent who believe they are closer to office This is a space worth watching Lord Hurd is former foreign secretary He is chairman of the advisory board of Hawkpoint Partners,3

2002-06-22, European Union leaders are today expected to unveil plans intended to apply maximum pressure on developing countries to curb illegal immigration pledging greater aid and financial assistance but falling short of applying sanctions as an immediate stick The measures are an attempt by the Spanish presidency and by Tony Blair UK prime minister to save face after they had made the fight against illegal immigration the main agenda of this summit A compromise due to be thrashed out today will show how member states particularly Sweden and France are not prepared to use sanctions against illegal immigration as a way to appease far-rightwing or xenophobic parties or indeed affect their own national interests Anna Lindh Swedish foreign minister has argued the fight against poverty good governance and targeted development aid were ways to curb illegal immigration not a fortress Europe President Jacques Chirac of France continues to think that illegal immigration should be dealt more on the bilateral rather than an intergovernmental or community level Essentially France does not want its ties and trading relations with former colonies such as Algeria and Morocco often the origin of illegal immigration to be compromised if the EU decides to go down the road of applying sanctions Britain sensitive to accusations that it was backing away from proposals that would penalise countries failing to help curb illegal immigration into the European Union insisted the Spanish presidency's compromise retained an element of threat There would be incentives for countries which were co-operating which of course potentially could be taken away if the co-operation did not continue said Jack Straw the foreign secretary Mr Straw said Britain backed positive conditionality new aid and trade help for countries that took back asylum-seekers whose asylum applications were refused and took steps to stop illegal migra-tion through their territory These should not undermine efforts to focus aid on poverty reduction in low income countries he said Britain's tone has softened since Mr Blair's letter to Jose Maria Aznar the Spanish prime minister last month which called for the EU's economic and financial clout to be used against countries that did not comply leading to suggestions that existing aid could be withdrawn UK officials hope the summit will set firm timescales today for action on asylum and immigration Britain wants an end-December deadline for revising the Dublin convention which is preventing asylum-seekers being returned across the channel At a summit where national interests are coming strongly to the fore President Chirac has put a French stamp on proceedings not only digging his heels in over immigration but also winning extra time for France to bring its deficit under control Mr Chirac attending his first summit for five years without an accompanying socialist prime minister also opposed a plan by Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroder of Germany for some qualified voting at EU summits The plan if adopted would have meant that Mr Chirac could be forced by other countries to fully open France's energy markets French European policy has been in the doldrums in recent years hampered by the cohabitation between Mr Chirac and Lionel Jospin his socialist prime minister but many think that is about to change Many in Brussels think Mr Chirac will also become very active in the talks leading up to the enlargement of the EU particularly in defending payments to French farmers  The euro ignored the latest signs of backsliding over the stability and growth pact rising to a 26-month high against the dollar yesterday David Turner writes The European currency peaked at $0 9722 more than half a cent up on the day Many traders said the euro was likely to reach parity with the dollar by the end of the summer pushed higher by continuing concerns about the US economy and stock prices www ft com/seville,3
1998-04-01, What's cooking So let's make a check-list as the British presidency of the EU reaches the half-way mark in its six-month term of office Tony Blair's address to the French national assembly went down well and the view from Brussels is that the British particularly foreign secretary Robin Cook are generally seen to be doing a professional job So why did Cook turn up in Brussels yesterday armed with a silly seven-page document claiming all sorts of successes for Cool Britannia in the political parlours of Europe His paper demanded credit for a dozen events that have little or nothing to do with the Brits including the European Commission's Agenda 2000 package on eastern enlargement and a separate report on which countries make the grade for economic and monetary union The progress report towards a People's Europe reckons telecoms ministers agreed measures that should mean lower phone bills across Europe while finance ministers signed up to a deal that could cut the prices of EU goods and services Meanwhile there's reported progress towards a ban on drift nets to save dolphins and even a deal to help zoos protect their animal inmates Still three months to go so little time and so many promises ,3
2002-06-15, WAZ Gruppe Columbia TriStar and Commerzbank have agreed to make a jointbid of about {XEU}1 8bn $1 7bn for the core assets of the failed media empire of Leo Kirch The three yesterday signed a memorandum laying the foundations of an eventual takeover of ProSiebenSat 1 Germany's largest TV broadcaster and KirchMedia's film and sports rights interests according to people at the meeting The formal contract due to be signed next week still needs the agreement of Sony which controls US film studio Columbia TriStar and the board of WAZ Gruppe the German publisher The exact price of the bid was to be determined during due diligence of at least four weeks but is expected to be about {XEU}1 8bn Wolfgang Hartmann chief risk officer at Commerzbank Bodo Hombach and Lutz Glandt representing WAZ Gruppe and John McMahon managing director Europe at Columbia TriStar agreed that the Kirch assets should be bundled into a new company after a successful takeover The partners think chances of success are high given their time advantage over other potential bidders and KirchMedia's urgent need for liquidity UBS Warburg which was mandated to auction Kirch's assets is said to have received more than 80 expressions of interest for the businesses the most attractive of which is a 52 5 per cent ProSiebenSat 1 stake The involvement of WAZ Gruppe would mean Germany's largest TV broadcaster remaining under mainly domestic control an issue that has concerned German politicians The agreement would give Commerzbank and WAZ Gruppe 40 per cent of the consortium each with Columbia TriStar holding 20 per cent ,1
1998-04-03, Sabena the Belgian airline is considering moving its pilots' employment contracts to Switzerland to avoid high social security charges and taxes in Belgium Paul Reutlinger chief executive said yesterday Mr Reutlinger said he wanted the Belgian government's approval for the move which he hoped to complete this year He said it would assist Belgium by ensuring it had a financially successful national flag carrier Sabena might also employ its cabin crew from Switzerland The employees would not be asked to move to Switzerland but their contracts would be issued in the country and they would pay their social security charges and taxes there Mr Reutlinger said this would result in significant savings to Sabena which is 49 5 per cent owned by SAir group the parent company of Swissair Mr Reutlinger's statement at a press conference in London comes a week after Virgin Express the Brussels-based low-cost carrier controlled by Richard Branson said it was considering moving to the UK or Ireland unless the Belgian government lowered its social costs Jonathan Ornstein Virgin Express chief executive said social costs in Belgium represented 37 per cent of employees' salaries compared with 8 or 9 per cent in the UK and Ireland High social costs and government interference made operating in Belgium extremely difficult if not impossible in the long term he added Virgin Express and Sabena have a code-sharing agreement This involves Virgin Express operating some of Sabena's services including the Brussels-London route In 1995 Sabena threatened to relocate 480 of its pilots to Luxembourg to cut social security costs but the plan was abandoned after opposition from the Belgian government Mr Reutlinger who is Swiss said yesterday that the new relocation plan would be carried out only after negotiations with the Belgian and Swiss governments and with trade union approval Mr Reutlinger said We want the Belgian government to say 'yes' It would mean important savings for our company It would be one element of guaranteeing a healthy airline for the future which would be good for the country's tourism and its internationalism ,3

2002-06-25, Zhang Ruimin chairman of Haier the Chinese white-goods and consumer electronics company claims to be a great admirer of Jack Welch And until recently the US business legend might have returned the compliment Mr Zhang has famously transformed the Qingdao-based company from a moribund state enterprise in the mid-1980s into one of China's few well-known consumer brands today Indeed Mr Zhang himself has become a kind of Chinese Jack Welch a charismatic business leader whose trail-blazing success has attracted glowing press at home and abroad But this year for the first time in its short history Haier and Mr Zhang have been attracting critical scrutiny in China and coming off much the worse for wear Instead of standing out from the mainland pack as Mr Welch ensured GE did Haier has been caught out making many of the mistakes typical of less admired Chinese companies The criticism has badly hurt the share price of their local listed company Qingdao Haier Refrigerator which fell from a 52-week high of Rmb18 33 to around Rmb12 in recent weeks Analysts and investors have been selling partly because of worries over the parent company's diversification into numerous other products such as mobile phones financial services and computers Such diversification mirrors the strategies pursued almost entirely without success by China's numerous other white-goods and consumer electronics companies These companies' forays into new markets have invariably been accompanied by price wars which are often strung out because of the ease of gaining loans from pliant local banks As a result profits have tumbled Haier's blue-chip brand gives it an especially privileged position when going to the banks for credit no matter how poor its business plan may be for a new product line and thus an unchecked ability to diversify It is impossible for Haier to make money in many of these new markets said a report by Chen Yichong of Southwest Securities In GSM mobile phones there are about 10 counterparts at about the same level as Haier and about 10 ahead of them And their CDMA phone has been a failure  According to Mr Chen Haier now has 86 gross product categories and more than 13000 specifications Mr Zhang no longer appears to be following Mr Welch's golden rule about dominating each business sector The second focus of the renewed scrutiny is also depressingly familiar territory in China especially for critics of mainland corporate governance concerns over transactions between Haier's listed arm and its state-owned parent Such related transactions are common in China as most listed companies remain under the majority control of their government parent in Haier's case enterprises controlled by the Qingdao administration Most comment has centred on the listed company's Rmb2bn purchase of the remaining 75 per cent of its parent's air-conditioning business using about Rmb250m of internally generated funds and Rmb1 8bn in equity funds raised in early 2001 The initial 25 per cent however had been acquired only a few years earlier by the listed company for just Rmb50m reflecting a valuation by the group company at that time of the air-conditioning business of just Rmb200m In other words the group invested Rmb200m into the air-conditioning project but got back from the listed company Rmb2bn in cash says Mr Chen Analyst Gu Qing of Haitong Securities says Qingdao Haier has paid top dollar at a time the margins in this sector are being squeezed by renewed price wars and a saturated market The air-conditioning business is inevitably on the downward slope he says On top of the expansion within the consumer goods sector the group company has spent about US$120m in an effort to establish itself in the securities and insurance businesses for the first time This includes a 5050 venture with New York Life International to sell life insurance This venture has a good chance of being profitable say analysts because of the way China still protects its local insurance market but it remains unfamiliar territory for Haier nonetheless Haier has not been confining itself to the domestic market increasing its investments overseas with the purchase earlier this year of a US$14 5m building in Manhattan to act as a shopfront for its 13 global factories Haier has also forged overseas alliances most notably with Sanyo Electric which includes a joint venture in Japan to market the Chinese company's products But even its enterprising attempts to establish brand-building beachheads overseas have drawn criticism at home both for the prices they have paid for factories and on strategy as well Haier declined to comment and referred all questions to the Qingdao government's foreign affairs office ,2
2002-06-22, Vivendi Universal Jean-Marie Messier loves surprises Sadly shareholders in Vivendi Universal do not share his passion When his latest deal to park a 12 7 per cent stake in Vivendi Environnement with Deutsche Bank leached into the market from a regulatory filing they assumed the worst The shares fell sharply on fears that the move reflected short-term funding difficulties at the media group This could be true although Vivendi's complex financial arrangements make it difficult to fathom exactly when its overstretched balance sheet faces real tension In its favour the deal allowed Vivendi to raise {XEU}1 4bn of cash without having to draw on its {XEU}3 3bn of unused credit lines This could have hit investor confidence even harder Deutsche technically owns the 12 7 per cent stake which Vivendi is committed to buying back at a later date Vivendi thus got access to cash for the period at a much cheaper rate than it could have from other sources Deutsche will presumably make the trade worthwhile by winning a role when Vivendi's shares in its utility subsidiary are finally placed with other institutions But the deal just adds to Mr Messier's maverick image It was originally struck on June 12 six days before the board agreed to sell down the group's stake in Vivendi Environnement below 50 per cent Instead of being announced it came out in a filing Deutsche had to make to financial regulators The company remained tight-lipped yesterday about the exact details of the transaction Mr Messier is an accomplished deal maker But investors long ago stopped taking the wisdom of his opportunistic and unpredictable moves on trust Until they feel able to stop worrying about yet another surprise crawling out of the woodwork Vivendi will continue to suffer from its debilitating Messier discount ,1
2002-04-13, We've had the gimmicks from Chancellor Gordon Brown Now comes the pain Any rise in the percentage knocked off salaries for National Insurance Contributions will ultimately cost business far more than it gains from silly tax breaks such as that for research and development National Insurance is the UK's second biggest tax after income tax It brings in more than £60bn roughly twice the corporation tax take So it is easy to see how a small rise in NIC rates for either employers or employees could raise several billion pounds It is a tax on employment Businesses will feel any increase either directly or indirectly through pressure from staff for compensatory rises in take-home pay Another bill that adds to employment costs is the one for red tape The British Chambers of Commerce says that £3bn a year has been added by measures introduced under the Labour government including EU directives Then there's the prospect of increased pension costs as surpluses disappear in occupational schemes Even if employers close these schemes to newcomers they contribute to the existing pot and pay into whatever alternative retirement savings schemes newer staff choose With the adverse publicity for scheme closures employees are bound to demand a decent contribution to their personal pension or higher take-home pay so they can build other nest eggs How should business respond to these extra costs Not by asking for a return of the dividend tax credit The cut in corporation tax from 33 to 30 per cent has saved companies more than £3bn which roughly offsets the loss of the credit to pension funds The £5bn that is bandied about includes all classes of investor who lost out  Companies did initially move to make up the shortfall in institutional income In 1999 when the full impact was first felt they paid out more than £50bn in dividends and share buybacks according to Lombard Research compared with just over £36bn in 1997 But in 2000 the amount fell more than £8bn The shock for shareholders is that now the tax system does not favour dividends companies are using far more discretion in deciding how much to pay out from after-tax profits So that stream of income will swing about But behaviour has changed too It now makes more sense for investors as bondholders to receive income from companies out of profits before tax That way each pound goes straight to the investor If it were taxed first only 70p would be left for the pot from which dividends are paid This helps explain alongside the bursting of the technology stocks bubble why the total returns on sterling corporate bonds as measured by Merrill Lynch have been about 22 per cent since the start of 2000 This compares with a 13 per cent fall in the FTSE All-Share So if there is no going back to dividend tax credits what should business lobby for in terms of tax Simple A further reduction in corporation tax As that will not be forthcoming what should companies do Respond to the rise in employment costs by investing in anything that saves labour and borrow to do it Interest rates remain relatively low and investors clearly have an appetite for steady interest income Think of it as a backdoor way to pay Mr Brown less tax ,3

2002-04-05, Past performance is no guarantee of future results The value of investments may go down as well as up Always statements of the obvious for equity investments they are now better understood after recent negative returns But when it comes to house prices many of us seem to lose all sense of the obvious Instead the talk is about rising demand fixed supply and hence ever-rising prices It is all rather similar to the bogus wall of money argument for equities that huge flows into pension funds would secure ever-rising stock prices House prices are rising fast Depending on whether you choose to believe the figures from the Nationwide or the Halifax they have risen by 13 8 or 16 per cent over the past year Both lenders expect further gains in 2002 Demand to borrow to purchase housing assets is high People still worry about getting on to the housing ladder the average mortgage advance to income ratio is at an all-time high Borrowing to buy-to-let is rampant nearly 10 per cent of property transactions in London last year fell into this category Additional borrowing against increased property values has risen to its highest rate since 1990 A sophisticated defence of these trends was advanced by Sushil Wadhwani an independent member of the monetary policy committee last week He argued that the reduction in inflation and nominal interest rates has allowed households previously constrained by the initial up-front costs of a mortgage to consume more now On this view recent price rises are merely a one-off move to a higher level Future household consumption will correspondingly be lower as individuals pay back their greater debt levels That is one theory An alternative thesis also highlighted by Dr Wadhwani is that people might be rather myopic when it comes to housing finance They do not realise that their burden of debt in a low inflation environment will remain much higher for longer than previous generations enjoyed And any rises in interest rates from current low levels will have a disproportionately large effect on repayments Evidence to support this view is quite compelling Currently almost two-thirds of mortgage advances are based on variable rates up from only 45 per cent in 1998 As variable rates are low at the moment this suggests households pay more attention to their immediate mortgage payments than to the long-term costs Memories seem to be short House prices are far from guaranteed to continue their upward march for long But the longer they rise the more likely the spending spree is to end in tears ,2

2002-04-01, From Mr Paul Poast Sir Michael Moore presented a convincing argument for why the Bush administration's decision to impose a 30 per cent tariff on foreign steel will be harmful to the US economy and its foreign economic policy Bush's policy on steel is bad for Americans FT com March 19 However his argument is amiss on two points First the granting of steel tariffs is not the only recent US trade policy decision to reveal the protectionist leaning of the Bush administration Second Mr Moore does not address what is perhaps the significant foreign policy question resulting from the tariff's implementation how can a policy that will alienate many of the US's staunchest international supporters be enacted while the US is trying to maintain an international coalition against terrorism On the first point the administration has consistently pursued a more protectionist trade agenda ever since it helped to create a new round of World Trade Organisation negotiations last November For instance in December the Bush administration failed to commit the political capital necessary to encourage a congressional renewal of the Andean Trade Preference Act with Colombia Peru Bolivia and Ecuador Then in February the US House and Senate each approved agricultural subsidy bills When the final bill is passed it will most likely be signed by President George W Bush and despite the spending caps placed in both initial versions of the bill will authorise overly generous farm expenditures beyond the limits set by the WTO This leads to the second point how can the Bush administration renege on its earlier free trade stance and still believe it can maintain the international co-operation necessary to underpin the coalition against terror This is best explained by the now evident supremacy of US military power The war in Afghanistan made clear how disparate the weapons gap between the rest of the world and the US has become Consequently it presents the US as possibly the only viable provider of collective security and makes the promise of US military aid very enticing to coalition members Apparently the Bush administration believes that this military stick and carrot is sufficient to acquire the co-operation of the international community thereby allowing it to use foreign trade policy for pacifying domestic pressures Paul Poast Lecturer Department of Economics Ohio State University Columbus OH 43210 US,3

2002-04-08, Shrill Schill It has a resonance all its own Ronald Schill Germany's judge merciless has chosen Martin Luther's home town of Wittenberg for his biggest campaign rally ahead of this month's Saxony Anhalt state elections Flanked by Ulrich Marseille the towering mop-headed millionaire leading the campaign for the tough law-and-order party in the state he will tonight ram home his familiar message about the need to tackle rising crime keep out immigrants and generally ensure good behaviour That went down a treat in last September's Hamburg state elections when his newly-formed party won more than 19 per cent Economically depressed Saxony Anhalt has a history of supporting maverick candidates a reflection perhaps of that non-conformist Lutheran tradition so the established parties will be crossing their fingers that the Schill effect is not repeated ,3
2002-06-14, As he cleared away the Consignia-branded coffee cups from his desk yesterday Allan Leighton took at least one small step in the restructuring of the Post Office The chairman's decision to change Consignia's name back to the historic and popular Royal Mail is likely to be by far the easiest step The detritus of the previous rebranding involving everything from china mugs to corporation chocolates will cost little more than £1m to replace But the symbolic break with the group's recent attempts to reinvent itself could prove a turning-point By making no secret of his contempt for the clumsy makeover ordered by his predecessors Mr Leighton has reinforced his reputation as a new broom capable of taking a fresh approach to its problems At first sight it looks an impossible mess Yesterday the group revealed a loss of £1 1bn for its last financial year A further 17000 job cuts in delivery offices were announced on top of 13000 redundancies already planned in the parcels division Ultimately the 200000-strong workforce could shrink by a fifth once natural wastage is added to the toll And John Roberts the chief executive who presided over the rebranding 18 months ago as part of a failed international expansion plan is retiring early Mr Leighton currently part-time chairman has little interest in filling the vacant chief executive's job himself The former Asda chief executive has staked his reputation on building a career based on a series of 11 non-executive directorships and is only now conceding that he may need to relinquish two or three of them But Mr Leighton's experience in the retail industry has left him with obvious talents as a showman His first tactic has been to appear brutally honest about the extent of the Royal Mail's difficulties Frankly the business is in a mess and there is no point trying to hide the fact The most important thing is that everyone in the company understands the current position is untenable  There is a suspicion that the company wants to exaggerate the problems to justify harsh medicine Yesterday's press release carried the headline £1 1bn loss underlines need for radical restructuring In fact only £318m was owed to operating losses The rest is an exceptional charge taken to pay for the 13000 redundancies planned in Parcelforce a big part of that restructuring A further £500m of exceptional restructuring costs is expected this year Operating losses on this scale are worrying enough Until last year Royal Mail had been consistently profitable for two decades paying £1 8bn in dividends to the Treasury over that period But the slide into financial crisis has its roots in the past Decades of under-investment have left the distribution network with relatively little automated equipment to compete with growing competition from private rivals Overcoming this legacy requires expensive investment in new equipment in addition to the redundancy programme By stoking the atmosphere of crisis Mr Leighton has persuaded the government to give back the dividends of the past 20 years helping to fund generous enough redundancy terms to have a fair chance of avoiding industrial action from the heavily unionised workforce Patricia Hewitt the trade secretary responsible for Mr Leighton's appointment has also been persuaded to take another step One big threat to the Royal Mail's finances was a plan by Postcomm the independent regulator to end its monopoly rapidly and open up the market to competition faster than had been foreseen Against her own government's policy to encourage the independence of such regulators Ms Hewitt was encouraged by Mr Leighton to apply not-so- subtle pressure on Postcomm to delay the proposals It worked Although Postcomm denies that ministers forced its hand the regulator climbed down earlier this month and gave Royal Mail an extra year to prepare for the end of its monopoly It was persuaded by new figures showing a rapid deterioration in the group's finances to grant a narrow window of opportunity for Mr Leighton to make job cuts and start on new investment Mr Leighton has a second quality from his retail background that may help him As part of a personal campaign to sell the changes the chairman has been getting up early to visit sorting offices and post offices to share his message with the workforce I have probably spoken to about 2000 of our front-end people he says They want to get on with it They want to know what it means for them  This man-of-the-people strategy has had limited results with Royal Mail's management which Mr Leighton wants to slim down from 15 layers to fewer than six He has a reputation among some senior executives for being unpredictable and aggressive But it seems to be working where it matters most The postal unions used to dealing with a remote management have responded well to his overtures The threat of strike action over redundancies has receded This has been made possible only by the generous public subsidy Without the government money to pay for redundancies Mr Leighton would have been unable to meet the union demand for no compulsory job losses But the mixture of sweet-talking and scaremongering has worked wonders with the Communication Workers Union one of the most militant in the UK Billy Hayes general secretary conceded yesterday that the group's financial results were undeniably bad The staff restructuring will still not be easy The union argues that service standards could suffer as a result and wants a say in how it is done Indiscriminately shedding staff is not an option if we are to continue the universal service says Mr Hayes But the strongest response the union could muster yesterday was to insist that any and every job cut is justified by management and that it will not affect the service nor impact adversely on workmates Given that 30000 jobs are at stake that is quite a step forward for a company that in past years has been responsible for more working days lost due to strikes than any other business Mr Leighton also faces political pressures Having intervened on his side Ms Hewitt has made it clear that she expects him to produce quick results Stephen Timms latest in a line of DTI ministers to take direct responsibility for the Post Office says there is no scope for a further bail-out From a trading point of view the position of Consignia funding is clear They've got the funding resources they need to bring about the changes they need he says The government has its own reasons for nervousness By backing him so clearly and putting pressure on the regulator it has aligned its reputation with that of Mr Leighton in contrast to its earlier promises to leave Consignia's management to commercial independence But a rare mood of optimism is creeping across Whitehall I have every confidence that the Post Office has a very successful commercial future ahead of it says Mr Timms Beyond the next two-to-three year time frame the Post Office can be very optimistic of its commercial prospects  Even Mr Leighton is cautiously hopeful If we had not got funding from the government and did not have a turnround situation and a series of actions then the business would be in serious trouble I am pretty confident with the organisation and with one or two new people coming in we will be able do this  He emphasises the change of attitude among workers I am confident we have come a long way to getting people's minds around the problem  If Mr Leighton's plans fail however it would leave the government with few options apart from privatisation of a business that would have resisted all efforts at reform within the public sector No change is not an option he says Unless we change we die ,2

2002-06-20, Scottish Power shocked the market with a late plunge that left the share price down more than 8 per cent by the close of trading By far the worst performer in the Footsie the company also saw its share price dive on heavy turnover of more than 18m double the daily average And the net fall of 30{1/2} to 342p took the stock to its lowest level for more than five years Apparently one broker had received inquiries about possible accounting irregularities relating to Pacificorp Scottish Power's US arm About two thirds of Scottish Power's profit are expected to come from the US this year The speculation came just a few days after the company's overall accounts were published and reflected the general nervousness spinning off from the demise of Enron the US power trading company Analysts were sceptical but one said that with a history of poor US trading and low or zero growth in the UK the company was an easy target If there is justification for the rumour people will be wary of the stock and if there is none some mud will probably stick said Angelos Anastasiou of Williams de Broe The company was sufficiently rattled by the slide to issue a statement after the market closed It said it had noted a sharp fall in its share price and knows of no reason to have caused this The company also said that its Pacificorp accounts had been signed off by PWC and published separately last Friday Serco the industrial and government services group was also hit by talk of accounting-related problems and the loss of a contract The shares fell 26{1/2} to 187{1/2}p Alliance &

WestLB Panmure raised its rating to neutral from underperform with an unchanged 630p target on valuation grounds following the biosciences company's recent share price drop However it said Amersham shares looked fairly valued now that the rating had fallen from 26 times 2003 earnings in April a 30 per cent premium to the market to 20 times Brambles Industries topped the Footsie with a rise of 13{1/4} to 312{1/2}p after a reassuring trading statement that underpinned analysts current year to June 2002 profits forecasts The group said in a trading update that it expects its continuing businesses to progress in the second half of 2001-02 and that revenue growth at CHEP Cleanaway and Recall has continued However Kevin Lapwood at ING Financial Markets remained cautious Despite the calming tone of the statement there is little to suggest that the stock should trade at a significant premium to the sector he said We retrain or target price of 280p and at these levels Brambles still looks overvalued  News that Xansa had lost its biggest contract 18 months ahead of schedule saw the share price tumble 19 to 120p Analysts said it would cut up to 10 per cent off future earnings Schroder Salomon Smith Barney and Old Mutual both downgraded recommendations Xansa said HBOS was terminating its First Banking Systems joint venture in December 2003 to take the contract in-house The

2002-04-15, Two or three years ago the fund management industry faced an apparently rosy future Markets were booming lifting funds under management and fees In Europe shifts in savings patterns promised a windfall as investors switched from bonds to equities and attempted to build personal pensions But now the picture looks much less promising Falling markets have eaten into funds under management while costs are being pushed up The industry faces a series of long-term fundamental issues The first relates to fees When annual returns from the stock market were 20 per cent or so few retail investors were bothered about 5 per cent initial charges or annual fees of 1 5 per cent But if as seems likely future returns are going to be in single digits those fees will make more of a difference Either competition will drive down fees or they will be set lower by government diktat  as was the case with UK stakeholder pensions On the institutional side fees may already seem pretty competitive But active managers may be stuck between a rock and a hard place If they stick too close to the benchmark they are accused of being closet indexers and thus not worth paying more than passive managers But if they veer too far away from the benchmark they run the risk of incurring Unilever-style legal action In the UK the Myners review has placed the spotlight on the transaction-related costs that fund managers pass on to clients In future pension fund trustees may well be going through fund managers' charges with a fine-tooth comb A world of low nominal returns also means that funds under management and thus fee income will advance more slowly than they did in the 1990s Of course there is still the hope of a general shift into managed products but the last two years may have delayed the process the old savings account may be dull but it is a lot safer than a Techmark or Neuer Markt stock Low nominal returns also create the temptation for fund managers to come up with fancy products that offer higher returns but at a greater risk The danger is that when such products deliver the risk rather than the reward side of the equation the manager's reputation is damaged In the UK this problem has already emerged with split capital investment trusts A second big issue relates to costs Fund managers have often played three roles as stock-pickers analysts and promotional pitchmen for their funds But many fund management groups are now creating separate teams of analysts to research stocks This may or may not improve performance but it does reduce dependence on the flawed advice of investment bank analysts It undoubtedly adds to costs Further upward pressure on costs is coming from the rise of the hedge fund Star managers can get higher fees if they start their own hedge fund plus a piece of the equity Traditional fund managers have been forced to compete pushing up salaries and bonuses across the industry The standard industry assumption is that these pressures will lead to a split There are economies of scale in fund management it costs little more to manage £1bn than it does to manage £500m The big groups will have the resources to employ the analysts attract the star fund managers and spend enough on marketing to attract the retail investor At the other end of the market there will be a place for niche players hedge fund managers who want to run their own show or those who specialise in limited areas such as small-caps and emerging markets who can carve out superior returns In this view it will be the mid-ranking players that get squeezed out of the market lacking scale on the one hand and performance on the other While this view may be broadly correct it may miss another dimension For a multibillion-dollar industry it is very odd that active fund management has yet to prove that it is very successful at its core business adding value by picking stocks Index-tracking has already taken a significant share of the market In essence tracking makes a commodity out of the buy-and-hold strategy Perhaps the next challenge will come from mechanical portfolios based on value using for example dividend yield or growth using earnings forecasts Such portfolios could be constructed at limited cost and might prove competitive in a world of lower returns The consensus is right the active management industry will consolidate But it may also shrink Philip Coggan is the FT's investment editor Contact philip coggan@ft com,2

2002-06-04, Austria'sMichael Groller has found one of Europe's most challenging retirement jobs A fortnight after stepping down as chief executive of Mayr-Melnhof Karton MMK after 36 years at one of Europe's biggest packaging companies he has re-emerged as supervisory board chairman of the heavily indebted RHI the world's biggest manufacturer of refractory materials for the steel industry RHI which had grown rapidly through ambitious overseas acquisitions ran into serious financial difficulties late last year as a result of a sharp downturn in the US steel industry and an explosion of asbestos- related insurance claims relating to companies it had bought In an attempt to avoid going under it severed all financial ties to its three biggest US subsidiaries which have all filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection However last year's {XEU}863m £544m loss has wiped out RHI's equity and its bankers had to launch a {XEU}1 1bn refinancing plan leaving them holding {XEU}400m of interest-free mezzanine debt which is not due for repayment for five years In addition the banks have had to top up a {XEU}145m convertible loan that met a lacklustre response from investors The day-to-day responsibility for turning round RHI rests with Helmut Draxler former head of Austria's state-owned railways who took over as RHI's chief executive last January However Groller who remains chairman of MMK's supervisory board will be responsible for helping restore investor confidence in a group that wants to be number one in the refractories business outside the US Whether RHI can achieve this objective rests on its ability to prevent US creditors disrupting its non-US businesses with legal challenges and achieving its goal of trebling its expected 2002 net income to {XEU}118m in the next four years Groller who was at the helm when MMK failed to meet its targets after its 1994 IPO is well aware of what happens to companies that fail to keep their promises William Hall,2
2002-06-06, The European Commission yesterday reopened a bitter debate over the economic effects of September 11 when it launched a formal investigation into whether a {XEU}55m $51m £35m compensation package to French airlines included illegal state aid Brussels has been at pains to reduce the direct aid given to European airlines in the wake of the terrorist attacks since it fears that hidden subsidies could prop up failing carriers and distort competition There is concern on both sides of the Atlantic that one of the unexpected consequences of September 11 has been to increase the role of the state in the economy But while the US Congress approved a $15bn {XEU}16bn £10bn bailout for airlines the European Union has only allowed governments to underwrite insurance schemes against terrorist attack and compensate airlines for the four days when US airspace was shut down The Commission has expressed doubts over the legality of France's {XEU}55m compensation package which principally benefited Air France because the money was intended to subsidise costs even after US airspace was reopened and flights had resumed The French payment was also only marginally less than the £40m {XEU}62m $58m payment Britain made to its airlines even though British Airways accounts for almost three times as much transatlantic capacity as Air France If the investigation concludes that illegal state aid was involved this will have to be paid back It creates a problem of competition said a Commission official You can't have one rule for the UK one rule for Germany and a different rule for France  The Commission is also keen on a single harmonised approach as part of its drive to consolidate Europe's fragmented aviation market Brussels' attack could be fiercely resisted by Paris particularly as the Commission had approved the French scheme earlier this year But the Commission says that a subsequent French submission made clear that the aid would be for more than just four days However at a transport ministers meeting last year Loyola de Palacio EU transport commissioner had suggested she would look at whether compensation for a further four days was permitted This was declared as a victory by Jean-Claude Gayssot then France's transport minister France's new centre-right government may not take such a strong line ,2
2002-04-03, Enterprise succumbing to Shell yesterday marks the capitulation of Britain's last significant independent oil company In the past three years Monument Oil & Gas British-Borneo and Lasmo have all been acquired directly or indirectly by Eni of Italy Five other smaller companies have also disappeared from the stock exchange since January 1995 three of which were bought by foreign predators Shell's bid at least means Enterprise's assets and staff will retain a British identity barring a counter-bid by Eni or another foreign company a prospect analysts believe is slim Enterprise's future had been the subject of speculation almost since it was spun out of British Gas two decades ago In recent years it had been hit by a series of production problems a poor exploration success rate in the Gulf of Mexico and two failed attempts to merge with Lasmo Ironically it announced on Monday it had been part of the Tahiti oil find in the Gulf of Mexico that insiders said could be a world-class field Analysts saw Enterprise as both too small to compete with the likes of BP and ExxonMobil and too large to offer investors the excitement of smaller oil companies that have a greater exposure to exploration The appointment of Sam Laidlaw as chief executive in October brought hope of a strategy that would allow the company to remain independent He had been lauded as one of the most gifted executives in the industry in his previous role with Amerada Hess In February he outlined a plan to lift production by 7 per cent a year over the medium term and cut costs by £30m a year Yesterday he said the plan had been given broad support by shareholders but would have taken longer to produce value than Shell's bid I didn't join Enterprise to see it sold within a few months but offers such as today's are too good to ignore Delivering shareholder value was our goal and with a 60 per cent premium to the average share price before Eni's bid in December we have achieved that he said The move will leave 18 exploration and production companies with a main London listing but none of them anywhere near the size of Enterprise The largest of the remaining groups will be Cairn Energy and Tullow Oil with market capitalisations of about £440m and £375m respectively compared with Enterprise's £3 5bn last night Iain Reid analyst at UBS Warburg said British independent exploration and production companies had failed to keep pace with their counterparts in North America where a series of deals over the past few years had created a number of super-independents such as Amerada Hess and Anadarko Petroleum Independent companies have to be dynamic have the right kind of shareholders and a business strategy that people believe in The people at the top of Enterprise were never quite good enough to compete and take the company places he added Mr Laidlaw said he still believed there was a place for medium-sized exploration and production companies in the UK and hinted he might consider forming one if as expected he does not stay with Shell after the sale This is a disappointment for the sector but I think other new independents will be created he added Given that Enterprise could not make a go of it even with the helping hand of British Gas's oil assets analysts believe Mr Laidlaw would be fighting an uphill battle ,1
2002-04-03, When Josef Ackermann takes the helm at Deutsche Bank next month he will do so amid expectations that he is grooming Germany's largest private-sector bank for a merger with a rival Deutsche Bank has unwittingly encouraged this by building a track record as an acquisitive bank Its purchase of Bankers Trust and Scudder Investments and its failed attempt to merge with Dresdner Bank are only the most dramatic examples Recent speculation has centred on Deutsche Bank doing a deal with Lloyds TSB the UK retail bank Indeed it spent much of last year negotiating with Lloyds about a possible merger designed to sort out Deutsche Bank's troubled retail bank Bankers close to the discussions which took place in the summer and were revived in December say they focused on two options an outright merger of the two groups or the part-sale of Deutsche Bank's retail bank to Lloyds The talks were the first time Deutsche Bank had raised the possibility of a full merger with another European rival since its aborted talks with Dresdner then the second-largest German commercial bank two years ago That Deutsche Bank was willing even to contemplate merging with Lloyds which has no investment banking business raised concerns among analysts about Deutsche's strategy If the aim was just to siphon off Lloyds' earnings to feed Deutsche's investment bank the shareholder reaction would be analogous to the NatWest/Legal & General deal which fell apart and led to the epic takeover battle for NatWest says one London analyst It is hard to see what else a deal would provide Lloyds and Deutsche have nothing in common  There is certainly little similarity between the two banks Lloyds TSB is a UK retail bank and life assurer with minimal overseas presence no investment bank and a relatively small corporate bank Deutsche Bank is increasingly dominated by its investment bank But there could be advantages for both banks Lloyds is desperate to escape the mature UK market and has been searching for a merger in Europe for more than three years Buying Deutsche Bank's retail operations would give it a big presence in Germany and upmarket businesses in Spain and France Peter Ellwood the bank's chief executive has long argued that the bank's key selling point in any deal in Europe was its retail expertise But he has said he is happy for Lloyds to join a group with a large investment bank as long as there is acommitment to retail banking What we see as a model is Citigroup which has got retail wholesale and investment banking and seems to work very well he said earlier this year The question is does a merger partner want to create a universal bank For Deutsche Bank anything that sorted out its domestic retail arm would be a relief The retail banking unit made just {XEU}156m $137m pre-tax profit last year half the 2000 figure on revenues of {XEU}7bn It had a cost/income ratio calculated by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney analysts at 94 per cent For Lloyds by contrast this key measure of efficiency is far better at just 42 9 per cent John-Paul Crutchley banks analyst at Merrill Lynch says If you follow the Deutsche strategy to its conclusion they want to be a Goldman's pure investment bank and you then have to ask if they want the retail bit at all  Last year's talks clearly show the bank is keen to sort out at least DB24 its retail arm It is also a reminder that both banks are keen to bulk up to place themselves in a stronger position to lead further consolidation in the banking industry Together their market capitalisation would be more than {XEU}111bn Unfortunately both banks have different views of what that next step should be for an enlarged group Deutsche Bank is believed to favour a deal eventually which would take it further into Wall Street and wholesale banking analysts believe Merrill Lynch Credit Suisse First Boston or Goldman Sachs could one day come into its sights Lloyds on the other hand is believed to favour a more retail strategy Analysts also doubt whether Lloyds would be able to cut costs and increase charges as much as it might like to improve the profitability of Deutsche Bank's retail network There are other more political impediments Some bankers at Deutsche Bank fear they would be the junior partner in any merger with Lloyds not least because Deutsche's market capitalisation of {XEU}45bn is smaller than Lloyds' {XEU}65bn Ackermann has wanted to run a bank for a very long time and now that he is about to get his chance he is unlikely to want to give that up straight away by doing a deal where he does not end up on top one analyst said A deal with Lloyds would also lead to control of Deutsche Bank moving out of Germany something which would be unacceptable to many of its board including Mr Ackermann He knows that radical restructuring of Deutsche Bank's corporate and retail banking businesses needs political acquiescence in Berlin The Lloyds deal therefore looks unlikely to be revived at least in the short term and the dream of cross-border banking consolidation in Europe remains elusive As Maarten van den Bergh chairman of Lloyds said In the next couple of years we are going to see European consolidation happen but I do believe it is going to be a couple of years ,1
2002-06-11, A puff of white smoke from the Department of Health's Richmond House headquarters Observer learns that after a protracted search Barry McCormick Southampton University economics professor has been appointed the department's chief economic adviser A plum job surely After all the National Health Service is currently awash with Brownite billions In fact filling the job proved so difficult that Clive Smee the incumbent who turned 60 in April had to delay his retirement while the headhunters circled Which suggests that many viewed life at the sharp end of the government's delivery agenda as a less-than-healthy career option The appointment of McCormick 52 a noted labour-market economist who has been a part-time academic consultant at the Treasury for more than a year signals the government's determination to ensure those extra bucks translate into higher output rather than price inflation And given the minute attention that the prime minister is bringing to bear on the subject Observer can only wish McCormick the best of British ,3

2002-04-11, Lloyd's of London yesterday broke with 300 years of tradition by announcing a move to annual reporting It also revealed record £3 11bn losses following the September 11 terrorist attacks Lloyd's usually publishes accounts three years in arrears However yesterday it announced 2001 figures saying the decision to report on an annual basis was in line with proposed reforms to modernise the global insurance market which last made a profit in 1996 The reforms also propose scrapping the existing system of Names wealthy investors who underwrite risk on an unlimited liability basis Lloyd's will also have greater regulatory powers to crack down on lossmaking syndicates Sax Riley chairman said the Lloyd's market needed to reform if it was to retain its position as a global insurance centre The significant improvement in current market conditions cannot serve as an excuse for putting off reform he said It is long overdue  Nick Prettejohn chief executive said Clearly the losses we've had over the past five years are unacceptable and we believe the proposals address that issue of profitability  The proposals are currently out for consultation but Mr Riley said he was confident they would be voted through this year Using its three-year accounting basis Lloyd's said that losses in 1999 worsened to £1 9bn against expectations of £1 67bn Losses for 2000 rose to £1 72bn compared with the £1 49bn analysts forecast Losses for 2001 were £1 56bn on the same basis Lloyd's which is already facing the biggest single loss in its history from the destruction of the World Trade Center said September 11 would cost it £1 98bn rather than the £1 9bn originally projected Robert Miller of the Association of Lloyd's Members which represents 5000 individual Names said These are serious losses and you can't keep on running a business like this The results from some of the weaker syndicates have been awful  Christopher Stockwell of the Lloyd's Names Association called the results appalling David Wharrier director of Fitch the rating agency said Even if Lloyd's moves to annual accounting it does not make the results any better It needs to concentrate on weeding out poorly performing syndicates  Mr Prettejohn said the insurance market was experiencing significant rate rises and was expected to return to profitability in 2002 Its resilience after September 11 had helped disprove those who had questioned its long-term future last year Lombard Page 23,2

2002-06-25, There is no respite for Jean-Marie Messier chief executive of Vivendi Universal Shares in the indebted French media group yesterday fell more than 23 per cent to levels last seen in 1989 meaning they have dropped by one-third in the last four trading days as investors took fright at its decision to rush through the sale of a stake in its water unit Vivendi Environnement The company's US directors who will be in a minority at a board meeting today in Paris are intent on finding a rapid solution to the collapse of investor confidence in the group's short-term liquidity position and in Mr Messier's leadership The shares were also buffeted by a Financial Times report that Rupert Murdoch was having difficulty in finding partners to share the cost of acquiring Vivendi's Telepiu pay-TV unit in Italy and might attempt to renegotiate terms Vivendi Universal said yesterday it would realise {XEU}1 7bn £1 09bn by placing a 15 6 per cent stake in Vivendi Environnement with Deutsche Bank much of which is expected to be picked up by French institutions The fact that the Telepiu sale is now less likely and that they have pushed through the sale of Vivendi Environnement without waiting for better conditions as they said they would has raised questions of whether the company's liquidity position is worse than recent filings suggest said Mark Harrington analyst at JP Morgan The utility unit will also undertake a rights issue of about {XEU}1 5bn which will dilute Vivendi Universal's stake will to 42 per cent and allow the media group to deconsolidate the water unit's debt of {XEU}14bn from its total borrowings of about {XEU}33bn Shares in Vivendi Environnement fell 7 per cent to {XEU}30 below the level at which they were first sold to investors in 2000 Vivendi Universal said last Friday that it retained {XEU}3 3bn in unused credit facilities However investors are concerned at its ability to refinance some {XEU}7 1bn of short-term debt within the media business as well as other liabilities which Standard & Poor's estimates at {XEU}1 2bn Insiders say the Bronfman families who sold Seagram to Vivendi two years ago now doubt whether Mr Messier can restore his credibility rapidly or entirely and are impatient with the chief executive's failure to arrest the rout in the value of their 5 per cent shareholding Marc Vienot the former Societe Generale chairman who is one of Vivendi's French board members said he did not believe any directors would ask for Mr Messier's resignation at today's meeting but recognised that the chief executive had lost quite a lot of credibility with the capital markets He has a strong position within the board and is doing the job for which we hired him Mr Vienot said If there were a change of strategy and he were not in a position to execute the new strategy things might be different but that is not the case The strategy is the same  Another French board insider said he felt Mr Messier would come under mounting pressure from US directors to resign and said he doubted whether the French establishment could save him if there was public dissent from the minority US directors I think Messier knows he is finished but does not understand the insider said Mr Messier is still a member of the French establishment and it will rally round against any organised US attack But it seems to me as though the campaign against him will not stop until he negotiates his exit package  Lex Page 20 France Telecom downgrade Page 26 World stocks Page 44,2
2002-04-30, This may come as a surprise to Channel 4 which has just secured the UK rights to The Simpsons for L1m a show but the most popular TV programme in the world could be on its last legs Not that Matt Groening the show's genial creator who was in Bristol last weekend to open the Animated Encounters festival puts it quite like that However he's the first to admit that it becomes increasingly difficult as the years go by to keep on not only surprising the audience but surprising ourselves When The Simpsons was first put out as a stand-alone series in 1989 it attracted a great deal of criticism in the US particularly from the Christian right But the show has now become so popular that it usually stays out of trouble says Groening For instance no one wrote in to complain when in one show Homer smoked cannabis to relieve his pain Now on its 13th series playing to more than 60m people in 60 countries exceeding even Baywatch in its prime the Simpsons have become global icons The power of the brand is such that Brazilian tourism officials were up in arms over a recent episode showing the family visiting Rio de Janeiro where they were kidnapped robbed and attacked by monkeys But while Groening a middle-aged bearded character seems almost bemused by the programme's success he senses that its days may be numbered I think we are closer to winding it up he says Although what happens generally if we win the Emmy for best animation show is that that gives us another couple of years to run it into the ground  Fox the Rupert Murdoch-owned channel which has shown The Simpsons for the past 13 years and is said to have made more than $1bn out of it would be happy to continue forever he says I think Fox will wring every last penny out of the show before they call it a day  The relationship between Groening and his paymasters has been a textbook case study of artist-manager conflict I have made them billions of dollars so there is a trace of a smile in their faces when I walk into the room he says But Groening is unhappy about Fox's handling of Futurama his animated science fiction show Now in its fourth series Futurama is Groening's comic vision of the future which owes much visually to The Simpsons but is a very different kettle of fish While Fox is showing this season of the series it has refused to order another blaming slipping ratings The Simpsons was always going to be a hard act to follow Groening says he feels like Paul McCartney after the break-up of the Beatles But as far as he is concerned the problem with Futurama is that Fox doesn't understand it They haven't really supported it I think it's a worthy companion to The Simpsons and we're really proud of it But Fox gave it a bad slot and zero promotion for the last three years  Critical interference has been another intermittent problem I was getting notes from them which contradicted themselves The show was getting further away from what I wanted to do he says They would write notes like 'These characters are too mean ' I thought you could say that about the Simpsons but if they had been nice we wouldn't be talking today  However he is determined to prove Fox wrong about Futurama and he is not alone in his campaign for the programme An internet petition not organised by Groening has already collected 105000 signatures of fans who want to save the series If Futurama is dumped Groening has several other ideas in development He describes them as similar in design to The Simpsons and Futurama The characters will look like relatives of those characters with the classic mouth overbites Given how important The Simpsons is to the network couldn't Groening threaten to break away from Fox unless they show Futurama That really wouldn't be my style he says No doubt the outcry would be even larger if The Simpsons was to be canned But while Groening suggests declining inspiration for the programme he still has a few ideas One of the most obvious themes of the show is that people in authority do not always have the best motives And that too applies to big business Groening is set to poke fun at Enron and Anderson in his next series while Krusty the Clown will run for Congress with the endorsement of several real-life politicians The fact is that there is a lot of fast food out there and shoddy toys and your newspaper is full of stories about the people who provide this stuff  Although this is a tad rich coming from the man who spawned tens of thousands of Simpsons paraphernalia including T-shirts tea towels and bubble bath the anti-establishment streak in Groening seems to spur him on I think there is a lot of corporate irresponsibility Consumers are bombarded with commercials and hype and propaganda and I think it's healthy to provide a counter-message he says But despite such ideas there is a sense that he has become increasingly detached from the creative process He has a team of 20 writers putting together The Simpsons and he says his suggestions often get over-ruled Having to manage his own production company it makes Futurama but not The Simpsons which has about 50 employees including animators and post-production staff also may have affected the level of involvement in The Simpsons I wear two hats he admits One is as the cranky cartoonist but I also have to worry about a lot of people and be a manager and boost morale and all that stuff I'm not particularly fond of the stuff which takes me away from the creative side  For several years there has been talk of a Simpsons film Many fans think the programme could make the leap to the big screen just as South Park did As far as Groening is concerned however it is not clear whether Fox wants it or not Creating a 30-minute programme is very different from making a 90-minute film and he is wary that a poor movie could affect the television show He is concerned about jumping the shark a phrase which refers to that defining moment when a TV programme has reached its peak The phrase comes from a 1977 episode of US sitcom Happy Days in which its main character the Fonz ditches his motorcycle for water skis and attempts to jump over a shark after that the legend goes the show ceased to be funny But Groening is also pragmatic about the show's shelf-life Because animation is such an intensely painstaking process it wears people out and audiences are always looking for surprises When any character is as stupid as Homer Simpson it's hard to keep surprising the audience  jamespickard@hotmail com,2
2002-06-13, The Australian government said yesterday it had received three final bids for the long-awaited A$4 5bn US$2 5bn sale of Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport expected to be the biggest privatisation of its kind in the world this year The airport is Australia's largest with 23m passengers a year and is also the last of the country's big airports to be sold It had originally been due to be privatised late last year but the sale was delayed following the September 11 terrorist attacks and the collapse of Ansett formerly Australia's second domestic carrier Nick Minchin finance minister declined to identify the bidders or to specify the timetable for evaluating their offers although the government has said in the past it would like to finalise the deal by the end of the financial year on June 30 Offers are expected to range between A$4bn and A$4 8bn The bidding groups are understood to comprise consortia involving ABN Amro National Australia Bank Vancouver Airport and Babcock & Brown Westpac AMP Deutsche Bank and BAA and Macquarie Bank Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Hochtief The final composition of the bidding groups remains unclear however following several last-minute changes including decisions by at least two banks to scale back their equity participation The government has attached conditions such as a requirement that offers must comprise at least 51 per cent domestic equity ,1
2002-06-07, Castorama has named a new adviser for its increasingly acrimonious battle against a {XEU}5bn £3 4bn takeover bid from Kingfisher of the UK The French do-it-yourself group has appointed Credit Lyonnais to work alongside Merrill Lynch its original adviser Although the company said Merrill remained as an adviser the new appointment is likely to come as an embarrassment to the US investment bank Merrill was last month forced publicly to defend the advice it had given Castorama in approving the selection of Salomon Schroder Smith Barney as the independent bank to assess the fairness of Kingfisher's {XEU}67 a share offer Merrill had failed initially to point out that SSSB advises Compass Group whose chairman Francis Mackay also chairs Kingfisher Earlier this week Merrill was noticeably absent from a meeting in France between advisers to both companies and Rothschild the bank chosen by a French court to replace SSSB for the high-profile assignment Bankers from Credit Lyonnais attended the meeting on behalf of Castorama Castorama would not comment yesterday but it is understood it wants to strengthen its team of advisers particularly with a French bank Merrill Lynch whose relationship with Castorama is thought to have been uneasy at times would also not comment yesterday However Merrill insiders said they believed Castorama was trying to delay Kingfisher's bid by objecting to SSSB's role Under the terms of the 1998 deal when Kingfisher merged its B&Q operation with Castorama in return for a 55 per cent equity stake an independent bank must be chosen by both sides to provide a fairness opinion on Kingfisher's bid Castorama had originally agreed to SSSB as the independent bank ,1
2002-04-30, Thus yesterday became one of the first UK telecommunications operators to scrap controversial accounting policies in response to investor concerns about the sector The move hailed by analysts as very conservative and an example to others in the telecoms sector depressed the group's underlying profits by £17m However Bill Allan chief executive said the move was worthwhile The sector has been tarred with the same brush That tar is sticky and we are trying to remove as much as we can from us he said Thus demerged from Scottish Power last month now treats the sale of network capacity as a fixed asset disposal Previously this had been recognised as turnover in the profit and loss account Network capacity transactions are usually with other telecoms groups and are known as indefeasible rights of use or IRUs The changes which reduced last year's turnover by £24m to £268 4m £229 3m come in light of investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission into the accounting treatment of IRUs by Qwest Communications and Global Crossing the insolvent carrier Fraser McLeish an analyst at Investec Securities said Nobody else has done this and it will be interesting to see whether others follow suit  The company reported earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda of £3 1m compared with losses of £24 6m for the year to March 31 Under the previous accounting policy ebitda was £19 8m compared with losses of £21 4m Pre-tax losses deepened to £104 2m £70 2m following a higher interest charge and a £21m write-off on the value of shares it bought in the market before demerger Losses per share were 14 76p 8 31p losses and the shares dropped 1p to close at 18{1/2}p Mr Allan said trading conditions were expected to remain difficult but the company continued to target turnover growth of 20-25 per cent and a rise in ebitda margins of 7-9 per cent He said We remain confident of the trajectory of our business ,2
1998-04-02, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India ONGC the state-owned upstream oil giant reported a 19 per cent rise in net profits for the year ending March 31 to Rs24 2bn $613m compared with Rs20 3bn a year earlier despite lower crude oil production The improvement which exceeded analysts' expectations came after a 13 5 per cent rise in operating revenues of Rs151bn with higher sales of gas liquefied gases and related products Crude oil production was 28 25m tonnes higher than government targets of 27 7m tonnes but down from last year's 28 7m tonnes Production has fallen more than 31m tonnes in the early 1990s as a result of technical problems in ONGC's Bombay High oilfield which is viewed by analysts as having suffered from overproduction I N Chatterjee finance director said the profits increase derived partly from higher prices for most petroleum products worth an additional Rs8 7bn over the year combined with stronger output of gas and gas-related products which contributed an extra Rs1 62bn Analysts said the profits figure reflected both the government's move last year to deregulate gas prices and a strong rupee ,2
2002-06-07, Richemont Richemont's chief executive has again lived up to his nickname of Rupert the Bear While Bernard Arnault head of rival luxury goods group LVMH last month predicted operating profit growth above 10 per cent this year Johann Rupert remained cautious yesterday Operating profits fell 32 per cent last year as like-for-like sales dropped by 1 per cent Richemont felt the full impact on its costs of investing in manufacturing and service as well as new retail outlets through the downturn Mr Rupert said Richemont hoped to see a period of gradual recovery this year but it depended on economic improvements There are however signs of life Richemont's like-for-like retail sales rose 4 per cent during April and May As with other luxury goods companies this was offset by weakness in wholesale But with wholesaling typically trailing any upturn in consumer demand because cautious third-party retailers keep their inventories low for longer the second half could improve There are also some positive signs in the difficult US market Japanese demand remains strong in spite of the country's economic woes Richemont and LVMH shares have had strong bounces since the September 11 trough up 44 per cent and 99 per cent respectively and are now back to mid-cycle earnings multiples This has factored in enough good news for now But it provides a solid base for the forthcoming floats of Prada and Burberry As long as they do not get overambitious on price the two should be able to lure in new investors ,2
2002-06-13, The Democrat-led Senate yesterday rejected a permanent repeal of the estate tax dealing a blow to Republicans' hopes of entrenching a core element of President George W Bush's tax cut past the end of the decade The proposal sank on a vote of 54-44 six short of the 60 required under Senate rules The vote was viewed as a sign of the shift in the political mood and economic climate surrounding tax cuts Last year 12 Democrats sided with Republicans to approve Mr Bush's $1350bn L924m tax cut which included a gradual phasing-out of the estate tax Yesterday only nine Democrats voted for permanent repeal Many of those who had voted for the original Bush plan cited growing budget deficits and the nation's deteriorating fiscal outlook as the main reasons for their change of heart Two Republicans John McCain and Lincoln Chafee broke party unity and joined Democrats in voting against it The vote was also viewed as a testing of the political waters for this year's congressional elections Republicans are expected to make estate taxes an issue in the November elections especially in farm states such as Iowa and South Dakota where there are important Senate races Supporters of a permanent repeal argued that taxing estates on the death of an individual was immoral John Kyl an Arizona Republican who led the fight for the permanent repeal said The death tax robs hard-working taxpayers of the American dream  But several Democrats seeking re-election brushed aside Republican threats that voters would punish them in November for voting against enshrining a permanent repeal Echoing a Democratic theme likely to resonate on the campaign trail Kent Conrad the North Dakota Democrat who heads the Senate Budget committee argued that fiscal responsibility was at stake When we look at the question of repeal of the estate tax what we see is the cost is enormous almost $100bn in this decade he said It absolutely explodes in the second decade to $740bn right at the time the baby boom generation retires  Mr Conrad failed to win support for an alternative plan that would have kept the estate tax but raised the exemption for individuals from $1m to $3m and $6m for couples Another Democratic alternative that failed would have added permanent relief for family-owned farms and small businesses Today the House is scheduled to vote on making permanent the provisions of the Bush tax cut that lower taxes for married couples ,3
2002-06-17,  Gareth Jones the former head of Abbey National's wholesale bank has made a stinging attack on the bank's management He said he felt impelled to act after suggestions that Abbey was trying to rubbish his past record in the press  Arthur Andersen's demise seemed inevitable yesterday after the former global accountancy giant was convicted of obstructing justice in the Enron scandal  BAE Systems is preparing to defy critics and press ahead with a $6bn £4 1bn bid for the space and defence interests of TRW the US automotive and aerospace company which is already the subject of an unsolicited $12bn £8 2bn offer from Northrop Grumman  Friends Provident the life assurer is planning to raise £800m in the bond market to fund acquisitions and shore up its weakened financial position  The chairman of Telewest misled shareholders about executive pay at last week's annual meeting of the cable television and broadband company Cob Stenham assured shareholders that all directors' pay had been frozen In fact the finance director who was at the meeting had been given an extra £40000 a year  Ian Harley chief executive of Abbey National came under fresh pressure this weekend as a former colleague Gareth Jones launched an attack on his management of the bank Mr Jones who was the former head of Abbey's wholesale bank has written to Lord Burns the chairman questioning the handling of the bank's affairs  Philip Green the retail entrepreneur wants to install Allan Leighton as chairman of Woolworths if he succeeds in winning control of the high street retailer  Virgin is in talks to sell take-off and landing slots at Heathrow to British Airways despite repeated claims that it is unable to secure enough slots at the congested London airport  The full damage inflicted by plunging stock markets on the pension funds of some of the UK's best-known companies is revealed today The newspaper says that several of the UK's biggest corporations have seen the size of their pension shortfalls balloon by up to 50 per cent in recent weeks as stock markets have tumbled  Woolworths which has revealed it held merger talks with BHS has itself been studying plans for a takeover of the Peacock discount clothing group  Laurel the owner of 600 managed pubs has dropped plans to remortgage its estate Instead it plans to float on the stock market next year The company has been looking at ways to raise extra cash since it decided to sell 1860 leased pubs to Enterprise Inns for £875m  Jefferson Smurfit the Irish paper and packaging group is expected to succumb this week to a £2bn bid from American venture capitalists Madison Dearborn Partners  Lord Burns Abbey National chairman is preparing to appoint headhunters to find a replacement for Ian Harley chief executive who finally lost the City's confidence last week Potential candidates might include Gordon Pell the head of retail banking at RBS  Taxpayers will have to stump up an extra £150m to buy off angry Railtrack shareholders when details of how the ruined company will be taken out of administration are published this week  French managers will desert Castorama in droves if Kingfisher succeeds in buying out the DIY chain and keeps Sir Geoff Mulcahy at the helm for six months  Arthur Andersen has been found guilty of shredding documents a move that sounds the death knell for the accountancy firm  Apax Partners the private equity firm leading a consortium bidding for the busted telecoms group Energis wants to merge the business with the UK arm of Global Crossing to create a £1bn alternative telecoms provider  Vivendi the debt-laden French media conglomerate is speeding up plans to sell off up to 20 per cent of its controlling stake in Vivendi Environment the world's largest water services firm  Senior figures in the hedge fund industry are warning of overcapacity and lower returns as a result of the flood of money  Management staff and shareholders of Artemis Investment Management are understood to have shared £65m from the merger with ABN Amro's unit trust business ,1
2002-06-12, The new set of public spending plans is likely to show a tight settlement for most ministries an analysis of the figures reveals Over the two years from 2003-04 the first year of the new set of three-year plans spending other than on health education and social security could rise by an average of just 1 5 per cent a year ahead of inflation That figure is significantly less than the expected growth in the economy The Budget in April set out plans for the total level of public spending over the next three years to 2005-06 The spending review which will conclude in about a month's time is working out how that total will be carved up between departments The Treasury says negotiations with spending departments have got to the stage of detailed discussions about ministers' bids The lion's share of the increased spending however has already been committed Only the health service has a firm promise spending plans have been set out for the next five years But the government's commitments to spending on education and social security are likely to mean that those departments will win significant increases in resources as well The amount left for other ministries including transport the Home Office and defence will be tightly constrained Over the three years covered by the new set of plans total public spending is set to rise by an average of 4 3 per cent a year ahead of inflation Because the sets of plans overlap however the first year of the new programme 2003-04 is also the last year of the existing three-year plans and most of the spending for that year has already been allocated Only an extra £1 2bn has been set aside for ministers to bid for So when ministers negotiate over spending the important years are the two following 2004-05 and 2005-06 And over those years the average rise in spending is lower at just 3 4 per cent a year The rise in spending is front-loaded into the beginning of the programme In cash terms the increase is almost 9 per cent in 2003-04 but only about 6 per cent in each of the two subsequent years Of the £56bn rise in spending over that period the health service has been promised £15bn For the other departments the government's commitment to education reiterated by Gordon Brown in his speech in Blackpool on Monday means that it will have to be seen to do well A continuation of the growth trend in Labour's past spending reviews average growth of 5 4 per cent a year ahead of inflation would give it an extra £10bn or so by the last year of the new plans 2005-06 Social security spending will also have to rise because of the benefits being introduced such as the pension credit If it also rises at its average rate during Labour's past spending plans by 3 3 per cent a year ahead of inflation that could mean more than £10bn extra spending by 2005-06 For the rest there might be less than £20bn left to fight over about a 1 5 per cent average increase ahead of inflation each year With public concern over issues such as transport and crime mounting and the war against terrorism adding to Britain's international commitments the pressure on spending ministers to grab as much as they can of the available funds is intense It should be no surprise that civil servants went into a spending frenzy in March to avoid an underspend in their budgets before the end of the financial year or that ministers have been more or less openly demanding extra resources Over the next few weeks the temperature in Whitehall can be expected to rise even higher ,3
2002-06-20, For most businesspeople acquiring a new company is a big event For David Grey managing director of a Sheffield-based specialist engineering company it has become almost an annual ritual Since he set up OSL Group in 1980 Mr Grey has acquired 18 companies including rec-ently six companies from UK engineering group United Industries The deal though welcome is already bringing sleepless nights In every acquisition there is an unexpected problem and with six companies I know we will have problems in spades However successful acquisitions depend upon the calibre of the management team and I have enormous confidence in the management of the companies we have acquired says Mr Grey His initial motivation for pursuing an acquisition strategy was to broaden his company's client base after the British Coal strike in 1984 when he discovered that not only was OSL Group dependent upon British Coal but so also were most of his other clients the strike wiped out the company's growth over the previous four years The strategy worked After acquiring the six United Industries companies OSL Group which manufactures and distributes seals and pneumatic products will have a turnover of £28m with 350 employees 10 businesses across 70 product lines and a broadly diversified client base Sue Whitmore a partner who specialises in acquisitions at accountancy firm KPMG says Successful acquisitions can enable companies to enter new markets to achieve a quantum leap in size to reduce their vulnerability to competition and assuming the appropriate target to take advantage of revenue and cost synergies  That said most acquisitions are not a success Some estimates say up to 80 per cent do not produce value for the acquirer Indeed a recent study by accountants Deloitte & Touche found that a failed merger or acquisition was a leading cause of problems for almost two-thirds of the UK businesses its reorganisation services department works with Many acquisitions fail because of management's inability accurately to assess risks and benefits and poor planning says David Ascot a corporate finance partner at Grant Thornton the business advisory firm Many companies simply do not have a convincing business plan they haven't thought through the acquisition he says People assume that strength in one marketplace can be replicated in another market They underestimate the risks the competitor risk market risk and management risks  Mr Grey's only failure so far is an acquisition in the construction industry a sector he thought he understood although he lacked direct experience I discovered that contracts within the construction industry don't hold any water A senior member of a large plc client told me 'When we put in a quote to a client we bid in at zero profit Our margin is what we get out of the client when he gets the tender document wrong and out of the subcontractors when we are sitting on their money '  Mr Grey decided to get out of the market It took two years to unwind the business and cost £320000 The lesson was clear to focus on businesses his operation understood niche manufacturing companies with good management where they could add value He realised early on that he would not get a good price by knocking on doors expressing an interest We target companies whose management want to exit from the business maybe businesses which haven't had any recent investment or companies in administration I am wary of buying companies on a multiple of profits particularly a high multiple that might be based on two or three good years  Tony Foye financial director of academic publishers Taylor and Francis which has acquired six companies over the past five years echoes the importance of price You have to be able to walk away from the deal if the price isn't right At any given time we are looking at maybe six possible acquisitions of which we will probably make one We expect the acquisition to generate a positive net present value over a 10-year horizon and we need to see a cash pay-back within seven years  Potential acquirers should be wary of overestimating the cost benefits and synergies and should focus on revenue growth post-acquisition a recent study by management consultancy McKinsey found The study suggests up to 40 per cent of mergers fail to capture the identified cost synergies Also Mr Grey says rushing in to cut costs can give the wrong message particularly just after the acquisition At this point says Ms Whitmore you need to make sure you get a clear message across to the key people in your company and in the business that you acquire They will need to understand your overall strategy and  how the acquisition will affect them from day one This is particularly true in the case of small and medium-sized businesses where word or rumour can circulate quickly and where one or two individuals are central to the company's success  Having made acquisitions as both a private and a public company Mr Foye believes listed companies are in a strong position for keeping and incentivising management There were certainly situations as a private company where we lost out when bidding for an acquisition against public companies owing to our inability to offer quoted share options he says Share options have played a vital role in attracting and keeping key talent in the acquisitions we have made as a public company  Mr Grey believes managements are often more attracted by the prospect of clear cash rewards than shares but he does not rule out the possibility that he might one day also be able to offer management share options in a public company Why Mergers Fail M M Bekier A J Bogardus and Tim Oldham  The McKinsey Quarterly 2001 4 Part II will look at alliances,1
2002-04-17, Few parties will emerge unscathed from NTL's restructuring negotiations but some will come out better than others NTL yesterday announced an agreement with its bondholders under which it will split its more successful UK business from the European assets and turn over the UK unit's equity to bondholders in exchange for $500m £348m cash and the bonds While some bondholders may have lost money on the value of their investments they are in one of the best positions because they will receive equity in NTL UK One NTL bond investor thought the bondholders' committee probably made more money than those who did not join the group This investor estimated that the average price paid by members of the bondholders' committee was about 38 cents The bonds yesterday rose to 43 cents These bondholders include Oaktree Capital and Angelo Gordon Those reluctant to join the committee may well have been those who came in at a higher price whereas vulture fund investors who bought NTL bonds at their lowest level when they traded in the mid-20s would have done relatively well But one investor said NTL bonds were not a home run for anyone The company's UK bank lenders which include JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are in the most comfortable position as their loans will remain in place and they remain the senior creditors The losers inevitably are the equity investors including France Telecom and Cable and Wireless Although the French telecoms company hopes to recoup {XEU}1 8bn £1 1bn through the eventual sale of warrants it will still have lost about {XEU}6bn of its initial NTL investment Jean-Louis Vinciguerra France Telecom's finance director yesterday said the company would exit NTL entirely once it recovered its written-down exposure of {XEU}1 8bn While John Malone's Liberty investment vehicle did not lose any money it spent plenty of time on a rescue deal that did not happen Some bankers have suggested he might return The legacies of Barclay Knapp NTL's chief executive and finance director John Gregg hang in the balance If the company emerges from bankruptcy and they keep their jobs they will be winners on one level although as shareholders they have lost out If all goes according to plan the rescue will have taken a surprisingly short time But with bondholders in control executives are no longer masters of their own or the company's destiny ,2
1998-04-04, Le Mal Francais exists But its depth and gravity should not be exaggerated France is not about to be ruled by the extreme right The country has just reminded us through two legal decisions that it remains deeply democratic The first the condemnation of Maurice Papon is a triumph for democracy and justice The relatively moderate nature of the sentence 10 years as opposed to the 20 sought by the prosecutor should be perceived as a sign of serenity not of weakness For the first time France's courts have recognised the contributing role played by Vichy France in Hitler's Final Solution incarnated by the ambitious and immoral figure of Papon secretary-general to the Prefecture of Bordeaux during the war For present and future generations of top-ranking civil servants the lessons of the Papon trial are equally important The state they serve does not necessarily protect them from any form of accountability Henceforth morality must coexist with raison d'e tat The second verdict condemning Jean-Marie Le Pen the leader of the extreme-right National Front to a two-year ban from standing for office is not historically as important Mr Le Pen has been struck off for acts of violence towards an elected politician of the left The ageing demagogue is on his way out about to become a detail of history to use the expression that he himself used to describe the gas chambers of the Holocaust Few will miss him But Bruno Megret his number two and a man who has adopted a cold calculating strategy could turn out to be even more dangerous politically After regional elections last month parts of the conservative right accepted alliances with the National Front in order to stay in power These pacts could constitute the most important political transformation of the right for many years To understand why one must take into account a combination of historical ideological and ultimately political factors Since the French Revolution the right in France has been divided into three parts The first sometimes called legitimist is counter-revolutionary anti-democratic and anti-republican The legitimists supported Petain and Vichy the National Front is their closest incarnation The second strand of the right the liberal has comes to terms with the French Revolution but not the Terror It is within this section of the right that the temptation to make an alliance with the National Front has been greatest The third element which emanates from Bonapartism is today closely linked with the Gaullist party The question is how could those speaking in the name of General De Gaulle even envisage the possibility of an alliance with the descendants of Vichy Ideologically the French have a tendency to keep fighting the battles of the past The publication last year of The Black Book of Communism  which describes and counts the millions of dead resulting from communism came as a welcome opportunity for many conservatives It allowed them to justify in moral and political terms their acceptance of an alliance with the National Front How could the left in power in a coalition which includes the Communists dare to give lessons in morality to the parties of the right The very demise of the Communist party has paved the way in socio-economic terms to the blooming of the National Front The popular protest vote has largely moved from the extreme left to the extreme right helped by a combination of unemployment and insecurity attributed to supposedly unchecked immigration At stake in the present crisis is the recomposition of the French right Conservatives will have to decide whether the time has come to create a new party of the centre that can offer protection against the temptations of the extreme right A change of generation in the leadership is badly needed But the availability of modern reasonable competent and charismatic leaders is far from evident France is probably sicker politically than is generally thought Yet the country has surmounted crises far worse than this The land of Liberte Egalite and Fraternite is more resilient than many foreign observers realise We are not living in 1936 The European Union itself constitutes the best guarantee of democracy even if its own democratic pattern is far from perfect France will endure ,3

2002-04-05, Stephen Byers is attempting to avoid future rows over spin by appointing a policy expert to replace Jo Moore his controversial political aide The transport secretary has decided his new special adviser should focus on policy rather than spin in an attempt to head off a repetition of the conflict between Ms Moore and his press office that shook the Department for Transport Local Government and the Regions Ms Moore who angered civil servants with her e-mail urging colleagues to bury bad news in the wake of the September 11 atrocities in the US and Martin Sixsmith Mr Byers' press chief were forced to resign in February after a series of disagreements and leaks that had destabilised the department Ms Moore was one of about 11 special advisers who were primarily spin doctors Mr Byers is in the process of choosing her replacement and although no decision has been made on the favoured candidate it is understood that the transport secretary will leave civil servants in the press office to handle the media Applicants for vacancies in the press office where several staff have left or asked to transfer to other departments have been told that Ms Moore's successor will not be involved in media work Officials applying to work at the department wanted reassurances that they would be free to do their jobs without political interference from Mr Byers' office The First Division Association which represents senior Whitehall staff has said that officials were bullied and victimised by Ms Moore Labour has faced repeated accusations of politicising the civil service There are currently 81 special advisers -adramatic increase from the 38 employed under the Tories However the government has said only 11 of the 81 are primarily involved in media work The government is to publish a civil service bill proposing to limit the activities of special advisers and setting up a new complaints procedure Sir Richard Wilson the cabinet secretary has said the civil service code should be given legal force An official at the transport department said Stephen Byers has taken no decision yet on a new special adviser and any speculation would be premature  Mr Sixsmith is negotiating a pay-off with the department but his job has yet to be filled Mr Byers announced his press chief's departure on February 15 but Mr Sixsmith has insisted that he never resigned His deputy Ian Jones has been suspended on full pay following the leak inquiry ,3
2002-06-18, Nasdaq the US stock market and two of Germany's biggest banks will today unveil plans for an electronic trading platform to challenge Deutsche Borse's dominance in its home market The world's second-largest stock market is linking up with Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank to offer trading in about 300 leading stocks including the Nasdaq 100 the Dax 30 the Euro Stoxx 50 and Dow 30 The proposed Nasdaq Deutschland will be a direct rival to Deutsche Borse which operates the Frankfurt exchange by far Germany's largest and comes amid mounting pressure for consolidation among Europe's 30 bourses and derivative markets It is understood the venture will be 50 per cent owned by Nasdaq while Commerzbank and its online broking subsidiary Comdirect will hold 7 5 per cent each Dresdner Bank controlled by insurer Allianz will have a 15 per cent stake and the regional German bourses of Berlin and Bremen 10 per cent each HVB Group Germany's second-biggest bank is said to be supportive The platform will start operating in January 2003 and hopes to be trading 2500-3000 stocks within a year according to bankers involved in the negotiations It will use Nasdaq's new SuperMontage trading system they added The participation of the big German banks is crucial to the success of the trading platform as only they can provide a sufficient level of liquidity to make it viable and attractive to investors But analysts said they remained sceptical about the venture's prospects Similar initiatives by Germany's online brokers and bourses failed to make headway said one It will have to be very competitive on pricing otherwise it is difficult to see how much order flow they can drag to this new platform he added The liquidity pool they are creating is not that big  Bankers said the venture was a result of growing frustration among many German banks over the dominance of Deutsche Borse which controls about 90 per cent of equity trading in Germany and its pricing policy This is all about cost-cutting said an official at one of the participating banks If we can set up this platform and cut out the exchange we can save a lot of money  But analysts said Deutsche Borse would almost certainly respond by cutting prices if the new venture showed signs of gaining market share Deutsche Borse declined to comment It recently launched its Xetra Best trading platform which enables banks to trade customer orders with other financial institutions without having to trade through the exchange Nasdaq has made repeated attempts to gain a bigger foothold in Europe but without much luck so far Last year it created Nasdaq Europe which took over the Brussels-based Easdaq a failed pan-European market for high growth stocks Poor markets however prevented it from attracting more trading liquidity In November it announced an alliance with Berlin stock exchange aimed at creating an integrated cross-border platform for trading US and European stocks Nasdaq said then that clearing and settlement costs would be 80 per cent cheaper once its system was fully operational The US exchange has also been talking to the London Stock Exchange although little progress has been made so far ,2
2002-06-08, William Hill the UK's second largest bookmaker is hoping that next week's World Cup match between England and Nigeria does not stop football fever sweeping the nation More rests on the World Cup than many investors realise including the success of the bookmaker's market debut William Hill which has about 1500 betting shops believes the turnover for the industry will have been £10m from England's victory over Argentina yesterday For its part William Hill will have raked in £2m The bookmaker is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the World Cup Not only will it earn millions for each game but it expects to win thousands of new gamblers around the world through its internet and telephone services This is one reason why the company's flotation one of the biggest new issues this year has been carefully orchestrated to coincide with the World Cup Confidence in new companies coming to the market has been hit hard since the flotation of HMV the music retailer But analysts maintain that the signs for William Hill's flotation bode well For a start it is a good cash-generative business with a dividend yield of about 4 per cent Betting shops are not traditionally high-growth businesses but the bulls are keen to point out that deregulation in the betting industry is boosting profits Profits have risen at about 20 per cent a year since 1999 due to extended opening hours new products and betting via the internet The abolition of betting tax is beginning to have an effect on earnings Profits have risen by a third in the past year and earnings before interest and tax are expected to grow 26 per cent to about £142m from £112m last year Some analysts think profits will continue to grow fast until 2005 before settling at a steady rate of about 10 per cent a year although others are less optimistic The company expects to benefit when bookies are allowed to set up more slot machines and to increase the payouts The government also plans to allow betting shops to sell food and drinks On this basis say brokers paying what amounts to between 12 times earnings hardly seems overpriced Other quoted betting shop owners such as Ladbrokes and Stanley Leisure albeit with higher-quality assets such as hotels and casinos are priced at about 16 times earnings The risks are that betting is a cyclical leisure pastime linked to prosperity If there is acontinued economic decline the growth may not materialise If so the company's debt expected after flotation to be about £500m against a proposed market capitalisation of about £1bn and costs associated with upgrading and building up the betting shops may become harder to manage Morgan Stanley the bank believes profits will slow in 2003 after a bumper 2002 The benefits of deregulation will only start to come through in 2005 it says Investors should remember that brokers have tried to float William Hill before in 1999 The idea was shelved after investors turned their backs on the £900m price tag The owners the private equity arm of the Japanese bank Nomura sold it for £825m to two venture capital groups CVC and Cinven The Financial Times' Lex column said at the time William Hill resembles all those flotations that entailed the vendors getting out while the going was good leaving new investors with a slow or no-growth stock It is coming to the market on the back of a bumper year thanks to betting on the World Cup 1999 profits may well be down The offer closes to private investors on June 14 Investors will be offered shares at a price between 190p and 240p The minimum subscription is £1000 The company's advisers set the price based on demand from private investors and prices offered by institutions The current reckoning is that the stock will go for more than 215p the mid price The price will be announced on June 17 at which point the shares will start trading on the stock market At 215p William Hill is valued at £922m and the owners CVC and Cinven will keep about 38 per cent of the stock At higher prices the owners will release more stock To register for a mini prospectus and application form retail investors can contact their own stockbroker or Hargreaves Lansdown www hargreaveslansdown co uk 0800 138 1410 or NatWest Stockbrokers 0870 889 3118 http//shareoffer williamhill co uk,2
2002-06-12, Derek WilliamsAsia-Pacific executive vice-president of Oracle the software giant does not quite dare to predict that the gloom that has enveloped the region's information technology sector is about to lift But nevertheless he sees some heartening new alignments in the tea leaves The past few quarters have been rough for a company that relies on corporate spending to drive sales of its enterprise software Its share price is languishing and the company announced in March that global revenues fell 16 per cent in the third quarter of last year adding that no improvement was expected in the first quarter of this year So Mr Williams' still tentative perceptions of some encouraging signs could be significant In the past 90 days we have actually seen projects being drawn up to meet a need going to the board but the board is still deferring them But that believe it or not is progress he says in an interview Prior to that last 90 days everyone knew there was no point in drawing up a project because it would never get approved So I draw some comfort that people are saying that they must see something but they are not quite ready to act he adds He also noticed a few weeks ago a surge in advertisements for new semiconductor jobs in Singapore's New Straits Times In Taiwan he noticed that TSMC the semiconductor manufacturer recently received its highest order book for 14 months and in South Korea Samsung has announced that it is investing in a new chip plant But beyond Singapore Taiwan and South Korea economies that act as leading indicators for volatile regional demand there are two countries that have over the past few years tended to march to their own rhythms China and India These are the jewels in the crown says Mr Williams China's importance will be emphasised by Larry Ellison chief executive in a speech in Beijing today He is expected to unveil some new initiatives in this fast-growing market In China demand is being driven by a confluence of one-off and recurring impulses The shift of manufacturing facilities to China from countries in south-east Asia and elsewhere has been one powerful driver for Oracle sales as multinationals require systems software to automate their new factories in China Such corporate demand also derives in part from China's accession last year to the World Trade Organisation WTO an event that many economists predict will raise inflows of foreign direct investment to above $50bn this year compared with $46 8bn in 2001 Another dynamic related to WTO entry has been the reorganisation of the tele communications industry The break-up of China Telecom the dominant fixed-line telecoms company into two parts this year is expected to fuel demand as is the migration from the current second generation of mobile phones to 2 5G and 3G formats Telecoms companies live and breathe information technology says Mr Williams In Japan we have a strong relationship with NTT DoCoMo and we will be applying what we have learnt there in 2 5 and 3G technology to China too  Revenues in China have been rising at more than 50 per cent a year in the past two years he says But there are signs that demand this year could outstrip even that rapid growth rate as local companies rush to upgrade their information technology systems to meet a perceived intensification of foreign competition following China's WTO accession In our applications business in China in the past 12 months or so something in the order of 100 new customers will have joined us Of them at least 70 per cent are local companies Mr Williams says The company is planning to hire 100 people to staff a new development centre located in the southern boom-town of Shenzhen which was scheduled to start operations this month Later this year it plans to open a similar development centre in Beijing with roughly the same number of staff Most of the staff at the development centres will be engaged in localising software from around the world and working with telecoms companies on issues such as how to enhance the capacity of mobile and short messaging services to deal with the huge numbers of subscribers in China China is already the world's largest mobile market but with demand growing by several million new customers every month networks suffer from overloading and frequent dropped lines The biggest place in the world for SMS is the Philippines We have learnt what it means to do this enormous volume of SMS to support the Philippines Now I am sure over time the Chinese market will be bigger than the Philippines Mr Williams says Oracle also has plans to initiate co-operation agreements with Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturers but Mr Williams would not give details ,1

2002-06-25, The pound's fall against the euro has increased the threat of higher inflation which could add to pressure on the Bank of England to put up interest rates It's the major risk to the Bank's inflation forecast said Ciaran Barr economist at Deutsche Bank If sterling continues to fall at this rate the Bank will get very concerned about it  Indeed Sir Edward George governor of the Bank of England told a Commons select committee last month that the implications for inflation were potentially considerable The rising cost of imports could feed through to higher prices for UK consumers even if competitive pressures prevented this in the short term Ian McCafferty the Confederation of British Industry's chief economic adviser said The inflationary impact is extremely limited in manufactured goods at this stage in the cycle because there's excess global capacity so no opportunity for prices to rise  The fall against the euro is only partially offset by sterling's rise against the dollar as the eurozone is Britain's largest trading partner The UK imports 50 per cent of its goods and services from eurozone countries and 14 per cent from the US The European Union accounts for 52 per cent of the UK's exports and the US accounts for 18 per cent The Bank takes this into account through sterling's trade-weighted index On this basis the pound closed 0 4 lower at 103 1 yesterday The extent of sterling's decline has taken most people by surprise The Bank of England's last inflation forecast in May assumed that sterling's trade-weighted index would fall from almost 107 then to 104 1 in two years time But the pound has already fallen below that level touching a three-year low of 102 8 earlier this month The rule of thumb em-ployed by analysts is that a 10 per cent fall in the exchange rate translates into a 1 percentage point impact on inflation On that basis sterling's trade-weighted fall could add 0 3 percentage points to inflation Sterling's weakness will only reinforce the judgment on the Bank's monetary policy committee that higher interest rates will be needed sooner rather than later said Nigel Pain senior research fellow at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research the think-tank In the minutes of the June meeting which kept interest rates at their 38-year low of 4 per cent members acknowledged that the decline in the sterling exchange rate were it to persist would have a material effect on inflation Mervyn King one of the Bank's two deputy governors who was the only member to vote for a rate rise argued that if the May inflation rate projection had been updated to take sterling's fall into account the central projection for inflation would be close to 3 per cent with the risks on the upside and rising quite sharply beyond the forecast horizon One problem for the Bank is that underlying inflation has undershot the 2 5 per cent target for 34 of the past 36 months It dropped to 1 8 per cent this month and some analysts expect it to fall to 1 6 per cent next month only just above the 1 percentage point margin of error allowed before the Bank must write an explanatory letter to the chancellor Raising interest rates to counter inflation potentially just at the moment inflation hits a record low could prove embarrassing But Mr King foresaw this eventuality in the minutes when he said it was important that policy was set on the basis of prospective and not current inflation ,2
2002-06-25, AOL Time Warner will cede control of about 2 1m cable subscribers to Advance/ Newhouse the magazine and newspaper publisher under terms of an agreement announced yesterday The agreement settles a question that has worried shareholders for three months when AOL disclosed that it may have to restructure its partnership with Advance/Newhouse The structure will leave AOL with about 10 8m cable subscribers meaning it will remain the second-largest cable operator in the country Losing these subscribers will lower AOL's revenue and cash flow but it will also lower the company's debt by about $800m Last year these subscribers generated $1 25bn in revenue and $570m in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation AOL said it would still push its programming into the homes run by the Advance/Newhouse group which operate in Florida California Michigan and Alabama As part of the agreement AOL acquired Advance/ Newhouse's stake in Road Runner a high-speed internet service Consolidating the Road Runner stake will boost AOL's revenue but decrease its cash flow The impact of consolidating the stake in 2001 would have added $90m in revenue but decreased ebitda by $170m The partnership between Time Warner Cable and Advance/Newhouse was formed in 1995 with the goal of building stronger clusters of cable systems But the deal had a clause allowing either side to initiate a restructuring of the partnership or to withdraw from it This year the Newhouse family threatened to walk away from the partnership unless it gained greater control over some of the cable systems Glenn Britt Time Warner Cable's chief executive said keeping the partnership together was a victory We've had a successful partnership with the Newhouse family but they had a desire to have a more active management role in the group he said That's consistent with the way the rest of their company operates  Keeping the partnership together will allow Time Warner to roll out new services he said ,2
2002-06-10, Jennifer Gillespie known among colleagues as the Queen of Cash has no doubt that her empire is set to grow A 32-year-old Canadian Ms Gillespie manages the world's second largest sterling money market fund for Scottish Widows Investment Partners the £80bn fund management arm of Lloyds TSB the UK bank Since its launch in March the fund has attracted £3 5bn of assets second only to Barclays Global Investors' £4bn sterling fund Money market funds designed to offer corporate treasurers an alternative to traditional short-term bank deposits are big business in the US But they have yet to take off in Europe This is exciting because it is the beginning of a whole new business which is so rare in asset management says Ms Gillespie About 40 per cent of US companies' cash or $2300bn £1575bn is held in money market funds compared with 5 per cent or $107bn in Europe Sterling funds account for a mere $18bn In the US money market funds sprang up during the oil crisis and the rise in interest rates in the 1970s Companies in the US know what they are and know how to use them says Ms Gillespie So it's all about educating people in the UK and continental Europe to the advantages of outsourcing your cash and getting a better return  Investors in the Dublin-registered Swip Global Liquidity fund can buy shares at a face value of £1 which are valued daily on a net asset value basis Income is converted into new shares and allocated back in proportion to individual holdings You are buying shares but you're not exposed to the volatility of the stock market because you can buy and sell them at the same price she says These funds are comparable to a bank deposit but you are getting a better return  By investing in assets such as commercial paper the fund aims to outperform overnight deposit rates We are giving you the ability to move in and out of the market on an overnight basis says Ms Gillespie And we'll give you a return that's worth seven days of investment  But with a yield of just above 4 per cent the fund is hardly shooting for the moon Its AAA-rating from Moody's Investors Service  the rating agency means that it has to abide by stringent investment criteria the average maturity of assets in the portfolio must be less than 60 days while corporate credit must be of the highest quality It's all about capital preservation and liquidity says Ms Gillespie Certificates of deposit which are issued by financial institutions account for the bulk of the assets with higher-yielding commercial paper both from banks and companies accounting for 40 per cent Its commercial paper holdings include Tesco the UK supermarket chain Cadbury Schweppes the UK drinks group Nestle the Swiss food giant and carmakers Toyota and Volkswagen The list is based on an analysis of risk and yield and a relative valuation across sectors Ms Gillespie believes that money market funds are ultimately a game of size People will come to me with things that they may not offer to our smaller competitors If a company comes to the market with a bond issue of say £100m we can buy the lot in one go  Size also helps to attract the most lucrative clients since large companies are keen to place up to £500m with one fund So far there has been only a handful of sterling funds with more than £1bn of assets This matters because they typically place a limit of 10 per cent on individual shareholdings forcing companies to split investments Management fees at the Swip Global Liquidity fund start at 20 basis points but rates are negotiable depending on the size of the investment The fund is aimed at the corporate sector but Ms Gillespie hopes it will also appeal to pension funds and local authorities in the UK which have recently been given the right to invest in money market funds If Swip has yet to overtake BGI as the biggest provider of sterling funds the firm has most to fear from big US competitors such as Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan which have an long-established record in liquidity fund management and are expanding in Europe But Ms Gillespie remains sanguine These guys are limited in what they can do in the UK because they don't have the banking and corporate connections that we have through Lloyds TSB she said There is however a bigger potential challenge Britain's entry into the European monetary union This would pit Ms Gillespie's fund against the European banks that dominate the euro money market ,2
2002-06-06, The European Central Bankand the Bank of England must choose today whether to raiseinterest rates The decisions will be a close call This should please each central bank when interest rate decisions are obvious past policy errors are often responsible The current difficulties confirm that monetary policy across Europe has been broadly right The case for higher interest rates in the eurozone is simple Inflation has been stubbornly high it has confounded repeated expectations of an imminent fall and has exceeded the ECB's self-imposed ceiling of 2 per cent for almost two years True the early estimate of May's inflation rate fell back to the 2 per cent level but underlying price pressures remain The eurozone core inflation rate excluding volatile energy and food prices has risen steadily since the start of 2000 to stand at 2 4 per cent in April With across-the-board price rises the ECB could not be seriously criticised for raising rates to dampen inflation expectations At the Bank of England the discussion will be rather different Inflation is below the 2 5 per cent target and is forecast to remain so until 2004 Nevertheless consumer borrowing house prices and debt are rising too quickly for comfort A sharp increase in inflation could follow With the housing market threatening to run out of control rates must rise soon to counter a potentially dangerous consumption surge Applying the brakes gently now would help prevent more dramatic moves later So interest rates are set to rise in both the eurozone and the UK The question is whether they need to rise today In both economies policy-makers would have arguments for waiting a while If the recent signs of lower eurozone inflation are confirmed looser money would be appropriate because domestic demand growth stubbornly refuses to rise to more healthy levels And in the UK a delay in monetary tightening would allow time to see whether borrowing and spending slow of their own accord Uncertainty surrounds the forecasts with inflation concerns limited to the end of the forecasting horizon If either central bank could stay its hand while credibly sending the appropriate signal monetary policy could be left alone for now The ECB would warn even more darkly about inflation and wage negotiators would respond with greater moderation the Bank of England would scare consumers into greater restraint But words rarely carry the same weight as action While it is not a disaster if Europe's central banks do not act today they should not delay much longer before tightening policy ,2

2002-06-20, It is atale of three cruise groups three regulators and one decision Yesterday's clearance by the UK competition authorities' of the $3 7bn £2 6bn merger between Royal Caribbean Cruises and P&O Princess Cruises will have repercussions far beyond British shores In land-locked Brussels the European Commission is investigating a rival bid for the UK cruise group the $5 4bn offer by Carnival Corporation Royal Caribbean's arch-rival The commission's decision expected by the end of next month will influence the outcome of the bid battle between the two US cruise groups and the relationship between the two regulators If Mario Monti competition commissioner follows the UK lead he would have to backtrack on a number of his department's preliminary conclusions on the Carnival case But if he decides to block the deal or clear it only after significant disposals he could face criticism from his UK counterparts and a possible court case from Carnival Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean have a similar share of the UK market for cruises an element that could make a divergence of views between Brussels and London even more controversial Mr Monti will also have to take into account the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to overturn his veto of the merger between the UK travel groups Airtours and First Choice In the ruling the judges criticised the commission for disregarding a previous investigation by the UK authorities To make matters even more complicated both merger proposals will also have to be cleared by US regulators towards the end of the summer Competition lawyers yesterday said the UK decision could increase pressure on the EU and the US to take a lenient view on Carnival This goes against what was expected This might impact the EU and US's analysis of what the market is  said Alastair Gorrie competition partner at Coudert Brothers The crucial question in Europe is who do the three companies compete with in the UK If they are up against providers of other types of holidays such as all-inclusive packages then neither deal is anti-competitive A combination of Royal Caribbean or Carnival with P&O would have too small a share of such a market to worry regulators But if the three companies compete only against other cruise groups or worse only against each other then European and US watchdogs could have a reason to block either deal In yesterday's decision the UK Competition Commission did not answer the question of market definition However it did say that a merged Royal Caribbean/P&O would not be able to increase prices at will because customers would retaliate by choosing other holidays or going to other cruise operators The Brussels authorities have so far disagreed In a detailed list of objections sent to Carnival last month they said they were concerned a takeover of P&O would harm competition in either the UK market for all cruises or in the narrower UK market for premium cruises They indicated the US group would have to make significant disposals in the UK in order to win approval According to the Carnival camp yesterday's decision by the UK authorities is a blow for the commission The commission has got a major problem said a member of the Carnival camp yesterday The UK authorities are saying that the UK cruise market is growing fast has a number of different players and has low barriers to entry Such a conclusion he said should also apply to a Carnival/P&O deal which would have a similar market share Royal Caribbean contests this view Richard Fain chairman and chief executive said Carnival and P&O were each other's largest and most direct competitors in the UK and Germany hence the intense scrutiny now being given to Carnival's bid by the regulators in Brussels Mr Monti's dilemma is to decide who was right and who was wrong ,1

2002-06-06, Senior executives at US media companies are eyeing the UK broadcasting sector for ways to exploit the relaxation of foreign ownership rules proposed in last month's draft communications bill Bob Wright chairman and chief executive of NBC was in London last week to look for potential deals He said yesterday that he was heartened by the new viewpoint towards media ownership When the prime minister of Great Britain stands up and says 'we're supporting dramatic changes in the ownership laws in this country because we really want to see a broader ownership base' you have to pay attention to that Mr Wright said in an interview It doesn't happen very often  The draft communications bill presented to parliament in May proposed scrapping the rules barring non-European Union companies from buying the UK's main television and radio businesses It would make the UK one of the most liberal television and radio markets in the world Shares in many UK media groups including Carlton Communications and Granada the controlling shareholders in ITV rose after the bill's announcement in anticipation that the move would spark a series of mergers and acquisitions However Mr Wright cautioned that NBC the broadcasting network owned by General Electric had been thwarted before in attempts to expand globally We had NBC Asia and NBC Europe in the early 1990s and we got punished he said More recently the company's international strategy has centred on CNBC the business television channel Mel Karmazin Viacom president and chief operating officer indicated this week he would be interested in buying UK assets if they were available at the right price Some Viacom cable channels such as MTV and Nickelodeon are already familiar in the UK and Viacom also owns radio stations through its Infinity unit The stocks of all these companies have run up on the basis that an American media company will buy them Mr Karmazin told a conference this week We don't need anything out there   enough to overpay  Mr Karmazin and Richard Bressler chief financial officer plan to come to London next week though Viacom cautioned that it was only to speak at an investment conference AOL Time Warner the world's largest media company appears less engaged The group has debts of more than $27bn and the fall in its share price has limited its freedom to act Wayne Pace its chief financial officer said yesterday that AOL Time Warner was focused more on maintaining its investment-grade credit rating than on In the near-term it's very difficult for us We're not in a position of doing anything right now in the acquisition area he said AOL Time Warner last year bought IPC Media the magazine publisher for £1 1bn Walt Disney is also known to be keen to increase its international revenues Jazz FM offer raised Page 26 AOL defends ads revenue Page 30 www ft com/media,1
2002-04-19, A suggestion that the current trading environment seems somewhat less buoyant took the gloss off record interim figures at DFS Furniture which also announced its fifth special dividend since its flotation in 1993 The shares slipped 13{1/2}p to 504p although they touched a low during the day of 490p Lord Kirkham executive chairman of the company known for its sexy sofas later remarked I almost wish I hadn't put that in the official statement There is nothing of any real significance it's subjective  He said like-for-like orders were running ahead by 3 per cent These would translate into sales once deliveries took place in six to eight weeks The group was on track to meet its target for the full year after reporting a rise in interim pre-tax profits from £24 4m to £25 7m before an exceptional credit of £17 4m This credit represented a write-back of a provision made against a long running court case with customs and excise over VAT on furniture sold on credit This credit worth £14 8m after tax was being paid to shareholders in a 14 1p special dividend The group has returned £187m of cash to shareholders since its November 1993 flotation which valued the company at £271m A further £6 2m could be released later and Jon Massey chief operating officer said that if so another special dividend would be considered Sales in the six months to January 26 rose 9 9 per cent to £211 7m helped by new stores and a 2 per cent like-for-like gain Operating profits rose 8 9 per cent to £25 7m as higher pre-opening costs for new stores of £2 1m £1 6m slightly depressed margins A sharp fall in investment income from £827000 to £29000 reflected lower interest rates and cash balances following the £20 7m special dividend paid in last year's first half Earnings per share rose from 15 7p to 16 4p excluding the one-off gain and the interim dividend rose 10 per cent to 6 7p 6 1p Comment  DFS shares have enjoyed a good run lately up from 402{1/2}p when last year's results were announced in October While reaction to the less buoyant remark was perhaps overdone initially and full-year profits should match up to expectations there needs to be some caution over the rate of growth in the next year or two That persuaded house broker Deutsche Bank to stick with its current year forecast of £53 2m but edge down that for next year by £2m to £56 5m Nevertheless a p/e of 15 coming down to 14 does not look excessive for a strongly cash generative company that never tires of reminding shareholders of its generous dividend policy ,2
2002-04-12, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's already facing external scrutiny of their rating practices in the wake of Enron's collapse are under increasing attack by the fellow agency Fitch Ratings which has accused them of suppressing competition in the rating of structured finance bonds Fitch recently sponsored a survey of notching a practice whereby the credit agencies assign ratings to structured finance securities not initially rated by them The survey found that a majority of executives in the structured finance industry believed notching created artificial price differences Fitch said that notching practices employed by Moody's and S&P through which ratings can be decreased by as much as four notches led to bonds initially rated by Fitch to receive a much lower rating subsequently from the other agencies This causes the bonds to trade more poorly and encourages investors to approach Moody's and S&P first in the hope of a more favourable rating rather than approaching Fitch said John Bonfiglio group managing director of structured finance at Fitch It eliminates choice in the marketplace  Fitch said that instead of notching it would accept a rating if a bond were given the same rating by two other agencies or in a split rating situation it would accept the lower of the two ratings Notching has been a hot topic in the industry for some time with structured finance a major part of the rating agencies' business In December the Bond Market Association called for an industry dialogue amid criticism of some notching practices But last week the BMA cancelled a planned round-table discussion on the subject and said one agency had indicated it was contemplating legal action against the other agencies The BMA decided the current environment wouldn't allow for a free exchange of information a spokesperson said Fitch declined to comment on the possibility of a lawsuit Moody's and S&P defend the practice of notching saying that they need to apply their own standards to rating bonds to ensure that ratings are accurate rather than accepting another agency's rating We believe that the markets are best served by all rating services exercising their independent judgment said Joanne Rose executive managing director of S&P's global structured finance group They also say they have provided extensive information to the industry on the way their ratings are put together We've tried to be very transparent with our notching approach said Noel Kirnon group managing director of structured finance at Moody's Moody's has hired National Economic Research Associates to conduct an independent study of ratings comparability and plans to use the results of the study to help inform its notching practices The study is expected to be completed by the summer ,2

2002-06-28, The theme in government bond markets was profit-taking yesterday with investors keeping a close eye on equity markets and any further reaction to the $3 8bn WorldCom fraud Government bond prices were lower following gains in the immediate aftermath of the WorldCom scandal and money flowed back into steadier equity markets For the time being analysts said government bond markets would continue to remain relatively firm Government bonds are being supported on 'least-bad-asset-class' arguments said Ian Douglas head of fixed income strategy at UBS Warburg We detect no enthusiasm for government bonds at sub-five per cent yields but there is clearly less enthusiasm for other assets  US Treasuries fell as stock markets recovered late in the day with selling being confined to securities in the telecoms sector and associated industries such as cable and media The Federal Reserve's statement on Wednesday accompanying its decision to keep the Federal funds rate unchanged at 1 75 per cent also did not hint at any change in policy With the equity markets remaining weak some economists had begun to anticipate that the Fed may need to cut interest rates before it raises them The Fed however made no mention of the equity market in its statement and said that economic activity continues to increase Yesterday revised GDP figures showed that the economy was stronger than thought in the first quarter Real GDP in the first quarter was revised higher to 6 1 per cent from a previously reported 5 6 per cent The 10-year note had lost {1/8} to 100 at midday to yield 4 765 per cent while the 30-year bond was down {17/32} to 98{21/32} with a yield of 5 468 per cent The two-year note was unchanged at 100 to yield 2 771 per cent In the euro zone the two-year German schatz yield rose to 3 947 per cent while the 10-year German bund yield rose to 4 923 per cent In the UK gilts market comments from Eddie George governor of the Bank of England last night had a calming effect traders said He said subdued inflationary pressure had bought the Bank of England time to see how economies were doing before raising interest rates This led to expectations in the market that rates would be on hold The 10-year gilt yield held steady at 4 944 per cent with the September gilt futures price down 0 04 to 113 14 Japanese government bond futures prices fell with profit-taking sapping recent JGB gains as the equities markets regained their footing Heizo Takenaka economics minister made a pitch for yen-denominated equities at the expense of the dollar We are starting to see a fall in confidence in US dollar-denominated assets Mr Takenaka said Yen-based assets can absorb the funds flowing out  The key September 10-year JGB futures contract fell 0 26 to 138 81 The benchmark 240 10-year cash JGB fell 0 218 to 99 964 lifting the yield 0 025 to 1 335 ,2

2002-06-17, How far is the government committed to using the private sector to provide public services This may seem a stupid question given the flak that everyone including Tony Blair Gordon Brown Alan Milburn and Estelle Morris has taken over the past year or so from trade unions and some Labour backbenchers on moves to involve the private sector in sensitive areas such as health education and social services But it remains a question that companies involved in the provision of such services are still asking certainly in crucial sectors such as health and welfare to work What worries them and should worry the taxpayer is how far the government is determined to engineer a genuine mixed economy of provision Is it merely interested in using the private sector as a source of bright ideas that the public sector can steal Does it see private sector provision as a stopgap to plug holes in services before more public sector provision comes on line It is the second of these questions that most worries Britain's private health companies including Bupa General Healthcare and Capio along with overseas healthcare providers that the government wants to entice to the UK The first question whether the government is using the private sector as a milch cow for good ideas is the one that worries some of the companies providing parts of the government's welfare-to-work drive These are issues of which Alan Milburn the health secretary for one is acutely aware To date the National Health Service's relationship with the private sector has been piecemeal Private hospitals have been used often in a last-minute rush at the end of the financial year to treat extra patients in order to hit government waiting list targets The famous concordat with the private sector signed in November 2000 has begun to change that with some longer-term contracts emerging But the process has been painfully slow And it has been even slower over the government's more ambitious aim of persuading the private health companies to invest in new fast track surgery centres for treating NHS patients This is perhaps not surprising Healthcare companies are unwilling to spend tens of millions of pounds on long-term investments such as buildings until they are sure they are not being used just as a stopgap until the NHS can expand its own capacity These concerns are not just limited to the area of health For example companies such as Reed Manpower and Action for Employment have over the past three years been involved in a whole series of pilot projects aimed at getting the unemployed back to work These range from privately run parts of the New Deal to the Employment Zones for the long-term unemployed and the awkwardly named ONE the precursor of the new-style Jobcentres Plus that the prime minister was promoting last week In each case the private sector has provided some of the pilots alongside the public sector's Employment Service It is still too early to value these projects accurately But it is already clear that the more freedom the private sector has had to innovate the better the results have been The experiments with ONE where there were strict limits placed on what the private sector could do produced little difference in performance between the public and private pilots By contrast the Employment Zones have produced notably better results than the standard New Deal That is because the private sector has been largely free to throw away the rule book and spend benefit and training budgets in the way it considers most efficient It has also been rewarded on the basis of results rather than fixed payments for specific tasks Yet in spite of this success the companies running the zones have had their contracts extended only for a year to next April And some of the more imaginative parts of their programmes such as providing personal advisers with wide discretion over how benefit and training money is spent have now been adopted to a more limited degree by the public sector in the new Jobcentres On one level that is fine An important reason for using the private sector is to experiment and learn new techniques that can be more broadly incorporated into the public sector But to be of real value this learning and adoption needs to be a continuing process rather than a one-off in which a few quick gains are taken and the private sector is then thanked and told to go away To ensure continuous innovation the private sector needs a viable business from which to operate In other words it needs to be sure it is part of a permanent mixed economy of welfare-to-work provision Currently that is simply not the case As one of the private providers' chief executives put it last week I am not sure there is a continuing business in merely being a guinea pig  To be fair the prime minister hinted last week that once the full evaluations were available the Employment Zone approach could be extended beyond the long-term unemployed to other groups such as lone parents That prospect would offer the companies the hope that their existing contracts might also be renewed Mr Milburn too has been trying to reassure private health providers that they are not just a temporary measure These new providers he told an NHS conference recently will become a permanent feature of the new NHS landscape Private healthcare companies now have to decide whether that is more than just rhetoric As they do so they are likely to watch what happens in the arena of welfare to work over the coming months For them it will be a test of the extent to which the government is genuinely committed to a mixed economy of provision and therefore of the extent to which they should invest nick timmins@ft com,3

2002-06-20, Gerling the troubled German insurance group is considering an initial public offering for its reinsurance arm Gerling Global Re according to bankers close to the group It is understood that Ger-ling which was itself put up for sale in March is looking to raise {XEU}3bn-{XEU}3 5bn $2 8bn-$3 3bn from an IPO by the end of this year Rolf Gerling who controls 65 5 per cent of the group has hired UBS Warburg to represent him and consider options for the company However Mr Gerling the grandson of the founder is said to be opposed to breaking up the company one of Germany's biggest industrial insurance groups Cologne-based Gerling is being advised by Deutsche Bank which holds a 34 5 per cent stake in the insurer and has provided millions of euros in emergency funding Earlier this year it forced Mr Gerling to put the whole group up for sale after losing patience with management Deutsche which has long sought to sell its holding is understood to be looking at all options for the stricken group including a break-up or partial sell-off of units The reinsurance business is seen as one unit which could be sold completely or partially to an investor or floated Talks are thought to be under way with several interested parties Deutsche Bank declined to comment Industry observers yesterday cast doubt on the possibility of an IPO given the weak state of equity markets and Gerling Global Re's current difficulties The reinsurance unit posted a loss last year of more than {XEU}500m largely because of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and additional provisions relating to its US unit Constitution Re One banker said the suggested IPO might be aimed at talking up Gerling's prospects given its current problems It is one possibility and it might be the favoured solution of one party But it is not necessarily the most likely option  On Tuesday Standard & Poor's the international ratings agency lowered its credit and financial strength ratings on Gerling Global Re on concerns about its weak earnings performance and the possibility of further losses at its US unit Earlier this year Gerling announced a restructuring of its reinsurance portfolio and the replacement of chief executive Norbert Strohschen Industry observers believe many of Gerling Global Re's losses are linked to Constitution Re which it acquired in 1998 ,1

2002-06-29, President George W Bush stepped into the darkened auditorium on the fourth floor of the White House annexe to deliver a private message to an elite audience of US business leaders Rocked by a series of corporate scandals US corporations needed to clean up their balance sheets to restore investor confidence the president warned Americans don't know if they can trust the numbers he told more than 100 chief executives gathered by the Business Roundtable last week according to White House officials Our country needs you to be straight up Leaders must lead  Less than a week later it was Mr Bush's turn to lead Speaking at the start of the Group of Eight summit of leading industrial nations the president ditched his private exhortations I am deeply concerned about some of the accounting practices that take place in America he said as details emerged of the apparent $3 8bn £2 5bn accounting fraud at WorldCom the formerly mighty telecommunications company We will fully investigate and hold people accountable for misleading not only shareholders but employees as well There is a need for renewed corporate responsibility in America  It was an extraordinary turnround for US officials attending world summits After a decade of basking in economic success the White House was attempting to shore up investor confidence and blunt any political attacks at home and abroad But far from marking the start of a concerted intervention by world leaders the president's comments represented almost the only public discussion of the crisis that has gripped international investors It was by no means the only crisis that world leaders were trying to dodge this week as they gathered for the summit in Canada A succession of European leaders strained to avoid questions about Mr Bush's Middle East policy speech on Monday pointedly refusing to endorse his call for the removal of Yassir Arafat the Palestinian Authority leader Jean Chretien the Canadian prime minister hosting the summit agreed that the financial crisis was a preoccupation of those attending Everybody agrees that we have to work on it collectively because it's not only a problem in the United States it's a problem that affects the economies of all of the Western world and probably of all of the countries in the world  But if the world leaders agreed on the need for collective action they failed to take any steps in that direction In terms of corporate governance the issue was discussed but there was never any intention or plan to issue an action plan and none will be that I'm aware of said one senior US administration official It all looked very different four years ago Then as confidence in international markets appeared to be on the verge of collapse the then Group of Seven took unprecedented co-ordinated steps to calm investors after a succession of shocks After Russia's debt default and the near-collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors issued an extraordinary joint statement hinting that they would cut interest rates to spur growth Led by the US Federal Reserve which engineered two interest-rate cuts in two weeks and organised the hedge fund's rescue the markets recovered At the time the US officials behind it were hailed as heroes or as Time magazine dubbed them The Committee to Save the World That committee was led by Alan Greenspan the Fed chairman with Robert Rubin then Treasury secretary and Lawrence Summers his deputy But of those policymakers only Mr Greenspan remains in office today and the Fed appears relaxed about the current crisis Fed officials believe the scale of it is not yet of the same order as the financial turmoil of four years ago This time round they are unconvinced that investors are reacting purely to fears about poor corporate governance Instead they say investors may be nervous because the US is fighting a war on terror or simply suffering the natural corrections after the bursting of the high-technology bubble That view finds an echo among the Bush administration's leading economic policymakers At the White House Lawrence Lindsey the president's national economic adviser has been highly critical of the late 1990s economy and appears to believe in the need for a significant correction In a speech to a recent symposium on financial transparency Mr Lindsey directly linked the series of corporate scandals to the Clinton era and the boom of the late 1990s Today in retrospect the 1990s seem clearly to have been a time of financial excess he said And today we are coping with the hangover from those excesses  In short the White House believes the corporate crisis is an ethical failure not a market failure It should therefore be treated with strict law enforcement a moral and legal correction rather than a restructuring of markets via greater regulation Hence Mr Bush's 10-point action plan for restoring corporate responsibility which includes banning corrupt executives from future board positions and disgorging their ill-gotten gains However the administration's political opponents point to another rationale for the White House approach Congressional Democrats are keen to cast Republicans as unwilling to clean up the markets in an effort to protect their friends in big business They point to the close ties between Enron the disgraced energy trader and the Bush administration Those ties extend from the president who was a personal friend of Kenneth Lay Enron's chief executive and Mr Lindsey who served as a highly paid Enron adviser For their part Democrats have engaged in a bitter dispute with Harvey Pitt chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission as they fight his plans to reform the accounting industry Democrats accuse Mr Pitt of proposing an accounting scrutiny board that would be beholden to the industry Democratic senators have instead proposed an independent board with the power to set auditing standards Tom Daschle the Democratic leader of the Senate has dismissed Mr Pitt's creation as a toothless tiger and turned his fire on the SEC chairman this week He is not doing the job in my opinion he said after news of WorldCom's accounting irregularities emerged Other leading Democrats place the blame on Republicans and their desire to scale back the government's power to regulate business While Washington plays its blame game some policy analysts believe what is required is a return to global leadership and a reprise of the G7's co-ordinated response to the 1998 crisis Richard Medley president of the consultancy Medley Global Advisors says a meeting of the world's leading central bankers and finance ministers is needed They should agree on a communique that makes it clear they will work together to stabilise currency markets at these levels and that active intervention will be used as necessary to achieve that stability he says Second the united central bank leaders should make it clear they stand ready to provide unlimited liquidity to all legitimate private-sector institutions  That appears highly unlikely with the limited ambitions that the Bush administration has in mind for the G8 At the end of this week's summit US officials celebrated the fact that they had abandoned the tradition of producing a grandiose communique on dozens of worthy subjects Instead they ranked the summit as a success because they had concentrated on a few policy initiatives such as disposing of former Soviet weapons of mass destruction That is what we have been looking to focus the summit on said one senior administration official Not a 30-page communique but a few key issues and action on those issues  Additional reporting by Gerard Baker,3
2002-06-05, Babcock-Borsig the German engineering group is talking to Northrop-Grumman the US defence group over co-operation in sales and marketing it emerged yesterday The talks follow the sale in March of a majority stake in HDW the submarine maker to One Equity Partners a US private equity group and have revived speculation over One Equity's motivation for buying HDW In March Babcock-Borsig Preussag and a financial investor sold a 75 per cent stake in HDW the world's leading maker of conventionally-powered submarines to One Equity The move infuriated some shareholders who considered HDW to be Babcock-Borsig's best asset There are talks with Northrop on a possible partnership but there are no talks about selling shares in HDW to Northrop Babcock-Borsig said It denied a German newspaper report that Babcock was talking to Northrop-Grumman about selling a 20 per cent stake to the US company Instead it said it was still considering three options for its remaining 25 per cent stake in HDW These were to use a put option to sell it to One Equity at a fixed price keep it or sell it to another buyer There have been suggestions that One Equity a unit of Chicago based Bank One is seeking to transfer HDW's highly-regarded non-nuclear submarine technology to a US defence group or use it in submarines sold to Taiwan However the German government reiterated this week that it would not allow One Equity to circumvent the existing ban on exporting state-of-the-art defence technology to Taiwan ,1

2002-06-05, British animal rights activists have taken their campaigning to Asia in a continued attempt to shut down the operations of Huntingdon Life Sciences the drug testing company Protesters at Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Shac have infiltrated three Japanese research universities accumulating video footage of experiments on dogs and primates The aim of this was to embarrass the Japanese research industry and government because of Japan's involvement with Huntingdon Life Sciences Shac said Shac set up to target HLS's locations in East Anglia spawned a US division last year to target the shift of the company's shareholder base to the US The protesters' Asia campaign is to be extended to Taiwan Korea and India where HLS also has operations HLS delisted from the London Stock Exchange in January in a move designed to reduce the vulnerability of the company and its shareholders to attack It reincorporated as Life Sciences Research based in Maryland in the US where shareholding rules allow the identities of investors with stakes of less than 5 per cent to remain secret But only weeks before HLS was subsumed into its new parent Stephens Inc its main financial backer dropped its equity and debt support following intensified animal rights activism that culminated in the New York home of the bank's president being vandalised HLS has also so far failed to secure its planned US listing The protesters' move into Asia comes as a full public inquiry into Cambridge University's proposals to build a controversial animal research centre has been ordered by the local council The inquiry ordered by South Cambridgeshire District Council will begin in November It follows an appeal by the university against the rejection of a planning application for the centre in February News of the inquiry comes amid controversy about the university's animal research activities ignited 10 days ago by video footage of its experiments The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection said an investigation had shown the university carried out invasive brain experiments on monkeys without the proper authorisation Cambridgeshire police had opposed construction of the new site in Girton on the outskirts of the city saying it would become a focus for protests by animal rights campaigners The county's resources have already been stretched by policing protests against HLS The police said protecting researchers at a new centre could lead to cuts elsewhere unless extra resources were made available Policing protests against the animal testing company cost the authority £2m in 2000 about 2 per cent of its annual budget ,3
2002-06-15, BrokerTec the online bond trader has confirmed that it is in talks over a possible strategic combination The company said late on Thursday it had been approached by several parties concerning a possible deal and that all discussions were at a preliminary stage BrokerTec is one of the US's leading online traders of Treasury bonds along with ESpeed and TradeWeb The privately held company which started trading in June 2000 is backed by about 14 banks and financial institutions and trades $135bn of fixed income securities per day The company's success challenged traditional voice brokerage dealers Cantor Fitzgerald and ICAP Cantor however moved all its Treasury dealing operations to its electronic platform ESpeed following the destruction of its offices and the loss of 658 employees on September 11 ICAP is understood to be one of the parties in talks to buy BrokerTec Industry observers have said that a purchase of BrokerTec by ICAP would significantly expand ICAP's presence in the huge US Treasury bond market ICAP has declined to comment on whether talks between the two companies are under way The discussions with interested parties are not related to the Department of Justice's investigation into the company according to BrokerTec BrokerTec received a Civil Investigative Demand CID in April of 2001 shortly after several other capital markets consortia received similar demands as part of an investigation by the DOJ into joint ventures in the bond trading industry The company said it had complied with all requests from the Department of Justice Should BrokerTec be acquired the deal would reflect further consolidation of electronic trading platform ownership Overcapacity a weak economy and poor business models have led many platforms to close down or merge In particular while platforms trading government bonds have been successful platforms focusing on the less liquid corporate bond market have struggled At the end of last year there were only 49 electronic trading systems in the fixed income market compared with 68 at the end of 2000 according to the Bond Market Association ,1
2002-06-13, The US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday gave its blessing to the takeover of Powergen the electricity generator that owns Kentucky's LG&E by Eon the German utilities conglomerate Its verdict comes 14 months after Eon announced its bid for Powergen nine months after the Kentucky utilities commission accepted the takeover eight months after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved it seven months after the European Commission cleared it on competition grounds Can this be the same SEC that in an effort to prove its post-Enron bona fides wants companies to file their quarterly financial reports within 30 days of the quarter's end The same SEC that only yesterday proposed shortening the deadline for other corporate disclosures such as directors' share sales or changes in accounting policy to two days To be fair Eon has led the SEC to break new ground in its interpretation of the Public Utility Holding Corporation Act whose repeal the SEC has to its credit advocated for 20 years The act restricts a utilities holding company from owning non-utilities But Eon owns a water company that the act eccentrically refuses to view as a utility Eon has also won five years not the typical two or three to divest other industrial holdings such as Viterra and Stinnes And the SEC has had other things on its mind Its staff were doubtless too busy keeping the US electricity consumer safe from the likes of Enron which when Eon launched its bid for Powergen was still trading at $56 a share ,1
2002-06-17, Back in the 1900s just about the only offering on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was manually traded futures on eggs and butter Next week the CME the US's largest futures exchange will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the introduction of Globex an electronic system that can process an interest rate futures trade in fractions of a second This transformation gives a clue as to why the CME last week applied to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a listing this year on the New York Stock Exchange making it the first US exchange to do so The pace at which trading in Chicago is being done electronically rather than manually by traders in pits is picking up sharply Volume on Globex last week hit a record 1m contracts for a single day double the level just before September 11 last year With its plans for an initial public offering the CME is betting on two things first that recent growth in derivatives trading volumes will provide a steady stream of earnings and second that customers will increasingly choose the cheaper electronic route The performance of derivatives in the past year suggests that the first part of the bet is fair Stock market volatility commodity price swings and uncertainty caused by recession and last year's terrorist attacks have driven investors to seek further risk management tools for their portfolios The number of futures contracts traded worldwide on futures exchanges grew from 475m in 1990 to 1 8bn in 2001 representing compound annual growth of 13 per cent the Futures Industry Association says In the first five months of this year the CME handled 209m contracts an increase of 33 per cent over the same 2001 period The CME is well positioned in product terms to take advantage of this trend Volume on its flagship eurodollar futures and options on futures contracts is growing fast It also offers a range of high-margin small-sized futures contracts on various stock indices known as e-minis As to the second part of the bet there is little doubt that despite insistence by Chicago's floor traders that open outcry trading offers greater transparency demand for electronic trade is growing among users of its exchanges It's a landslide victory for electronic products says Russ Wafendorf Jr president of Peregrine Financial Group a large CME customer But uncertainty on a number of scores makes predicting the success of an IPO tricky Morgan Stanley and UBS Warburg are advising the CME which believes an issue could raise up to $150m One question is whether the CME can make the switch to electronic trading fast enough to ensure volume stays in Chicago and does not slip away to its fully electronic European rivals Most of its revenues still come from open outcry trades The exchange's ability to go electronic could be constrained by some of its existing shareholders Although the exchange demutualised in late 2000 certain shareholders could still block key decisions Our trading and clearing members who may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of other shareholders own substantially all of our voting stock account for 16 of the 20 directors on our board and will continue to exert substantial influence on us including through specific rights of the holders of our Class B common stock to limit changes relating to our open outcry trading operations and to elect directors the CME says in an SEC filing The exchange is also a co-defendant with the Chicago Board of Trade and New York Mercantile Exchange in apotentially damaging lawsuit from eSpeed Cantor Fitzgerald's electronic platform The suit alleges violation of a patent dealing with the matching of bids and offers of futures contracts on an electronic platform But perhaps the biggest imponderable is valuation Given its dependence on open outcry revenues a comparison with its all-electronic European rivals is problematic analysts say Also historic earnings figures reflect the fact that the exchange was run in its members' rather than shareholders' interests Although revenues have been healthy recently last year the CME made net income of $68m on revenues of $387m investors would be hard-pressed to find consistency in its margins Operating margin last year was an impressive 29 5 per cent but a negative 4 1 per cent in 2000 ,2
2002-06-05, From bumper stickers on the back of Bolivian taxis to advertising posters one campaign slogan sticks in the mind Not more of the same NFR the force for change  It is election time in Bolivia and change is the battle cry of the New Republican Force party and its leader Manfred Reyes The populist former mayor tops the opinion polls among some nine other candidates ahead of the June 30 presidential elections In one of the toughest-fought election battles for years Mr Reyes' call for change appeals to voters desperate for a let-up after 20 years of economic austerity and free-market reforms ushered in by Bolivia's return to democracy after decades of hardline military rule The contest to select a successor to President Jorge Quiroga is boiling down to a choice between continuing with current market-oriented policies or jettisoning some or all of them in favour of a return to greater economic intervention With his dashing looks and promises of more public spending and growth Mr Reyes four-times mayor of the city of Cochabamba has so far left his main rivals ex-presidents Jaime Paz MIR party another populist and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada MNR a pro-market reformer trailing But whoever wins the race will find that Bolivia's tight fiscal situation and high public debt provide little leeway for radical policy changes analysts say The crisis in neighbouring Argentina is a stark reminder of what happens if governments fail to heed economic truths There is a need for a fiscal adjustment in the next six months which means popular promises will have to wait if the next government wants to stay within the international donors' umbrella said Pablo Gottret the pensions and securities regulator Land-locked Bolivia still one of South America's poorest countries remains highly dependent on donations and low-interest credits to stay afloat and finance its anti-poverty initiatives It will be several years before recently discovered natural gas reserves represent a substantial revenue earner The Inter-American Development Bank IDB its biggest donor which lends $100m-$120m a year will meet the new coalition government in September to discuss its programme Our biggest fear is that the next government takes the country on a populist adventure said Philip Dewez IDB representative Even so the success of Mr Reyes' populist agenda owes much to popular disenchantment with the results of the economic shock treatment begun in 1985 People just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel said Gonzalo Chavez an economics professor at the Bolivian Catholic University Manfred Reyes a political unknown is offering them a list of promises as long as a Chinese restaurant menu  Despite achieving macro-economic and political stability and opening up the $7 8bn economy to competition the reforms of the last two decades have failed to deliver more jobs or better pay to the poor in the nation of 8 3m people Moreover Bolivia has received recently a devastating combination of body-blows crises in Brazil Argentina and Ecuador key markets for Bolivian goods the removal of illegal drug and contraband revenues historically low metal prices while riots and road blocks in the coca-growing areas have hit tourism The drive to wipe out coca leaf cultivation will have to continue regardless of who wins Armando Pinel economic policy adviser to the Central Bank estimated that growth in gross domestic product would reach 2 8 per cent this year just level with population growth compared with 1 2 per cent last year continuing a trend of low growth in the last four years Foreign investment in sectors such as telecoms water and gas is expanding and is expected to represent 8 6 per cent of GDP this year while gas exports are expected to grow 50 per cent One of the big challenges for the next government is managing Bolivia's enormous natural gas reserves Despite negative remarks about gas privatisation during his campaign Mr Reyes is unlikely to make any significant energy policy reversals if he wins the election analysts say Generally any changes made by the next government will to have fit around the country's limited budget and political expediency concludes Carlos Toranzo a political analyst The pre-election populist discourse will quickly run up against some tough economic realities ,3
2002-04-22, Jacques Chirac last night looked set to retain the French presidency for a second term as adisgruntled electorate gave a huge protest vote to Jean-Marie Le Pen the hard-right leader of the National Front who appeared to have ejected Socialist premier Lionel Jospin from the second-round contest With 66 per cent of the votes counted Mr Le Pen had won 17 46 per cent of the vote putting him in second place behind Mr Chirac with 19 51 per cent If Mr Le Pen defeats Mr Jospin who won a poor 15 6 per cent it would be one of the biggest political upsets in France's post-war history Last night Mr Jospin said he would resign after the second round on May 5 Then the French electorate is likely to be given a choice between Mr Chirac the 69-year-old outgoing president whose image has suffered from a series of corruption scandals and the 73 year-old Mr Le Pen a former paratrooper whose National Front party has openly identified with racist policies and has no parliamentary representation Confident of his place in the second round Mr Le Pen made an appeal to all French people to forget their ideologies and back him as a man of the people to beat Mr Chirac Senior members of Mr Jospin's team before his announcement admitted that the game looked to be over The prospect of France shifting to the right will affect the political colour of Europe at a time when the Silvio Berlusconi government in Italy has already altered the balance France's moderate and fragmented right was expected to rally round Mr Chirac for the second round to provide the momentum to win the June parliamentary elections Commentators said that in the unlikely event of Mr Le Pen being elected president of France this would raise problems far worse than those presented by the entry of the faction led by Jorg Haider into the Austrian government Last night's events posed unprecedented questions about France where almost half the electorate traditionally is identified with the left Mr Jospin was last night expected to resign in order to make way for new leadership in his Socialist party in the hope that this would improve the left's image to fight the June general elections However he was expected to stay on as prime minister until after the second round of the presidential election Yesterday's first-round vote followed a generally lacklustre campaign during which Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin were the frontrunners But neither of the two politicians made a significant impact on the electorate after having shared an awkward cohabitation since 1997 Mr Jospin in particular was penalised for his dour image and a failure to capitalise on a competent five years in government Mr Le Pen was seen to have profited from the French election system which on this occasion allowed 16 candidates to enter the field Mr Jospin's support was eroded by the performance of three hard-left candidates plus the Communist and Green candidates as well as by Jean-Pierre Cheve`nement his former interior minister Until yesterday's vote Mr Le Pen was seen likely to gain about 14 per cent But analysts said a large number of last-minute votes went to him as he profited from his stance on the main campaign issue of law and order For the first time under the Fifth republic voters were going to the polls in the two-round contest to choose a head of state with a mandate reduced to five years from seven The first round was marred by an unprecedented level of abstention 28 per cent of voters abstained Earlier report Page 8 www ft com/europe,3
2002-04-17, Stubbornly high inflation rates in the eurozone are causing financial markets to wonder whether the European Central Bank may raise interest rates as early as June The issue is less the rise in oil prices over recent months which may prove to be a temporary shock than the failure of core inflation which excludes energy and food prices to show any sign of slowing down Core inflation is still much higher than we would like Yves Mersch an ECB council member said last weekend Echoing his remarks Pedro Solbes European Union commissioner for monetary affairs said yesterday The inflation prospect is not looking quite so good now  When Eurostat the EU's statistical agency publishes data for eurozone inflation today they are expected to show that annual headline inflation is about 2 5 per cent well above the ECB's 2 per cent target ceiling But Wim Duisenberg the ECB president says headline inflation should soon fall to just below 2 per cent and on average stay at that level for the rest of 2002 and in 2003 More troublesome is core inflation to which the ECB pays close attention Measured on Eurostat's definition which excludes energy food alcohol and tobacco prices core inflation rose to 2 5 per cent in February from 2 4 per cent in January This was its highest level since May 1996 and reflects a steady upward trend in core inflation since mid-1999 Unless it starts to come down soon the ECB may feel obliged to raise its main interest rate from 3 25 per cent where it has stood since last November However in remarks last Saturday Mr Duisenberg said the ECB's current stance was appropriate a sign that no rate rise is likely in May Javier Perez de Azpillaga an economist at Goldman Sachs identifies three factors behind the rise in core inflation One is a statistical quirk caused by the inclusion of promotional sales especially clothes in the inflation indices of Italy and Spain since last January This should unwind over time A second factor is that telecommunications prices are falling less rapidly this year than in early 2001 The third most politically sensitive element is the rise in service prices notably at hotels restaurants and cafes Many economists as well as the general public blame this on the introduction of euro banknotes and coins in January European governments the Commission and the ECB deny that the euro changeover has had much impact on inflation But in Germany the eurozone's largest economy retail sales were distinctly weak in the first quarter of this year www ft com/eurozone,2
2002-06-13, Doctors yesterday won their battle to stop the government imposing a ban on private practice by newly appointed National Health Service consultants In a significant retreat ministers are offering Britain's 26000 consultants a stick-and-carrot approach that will boost their salaries by up to 25 per cent in return for more commitment to NHS work Although the deal stops short of stuffing the consultants' mouths with gold it offers them a 15 per cent increase in lifetime earnings a further 10 per cent rise over the next three years and payment for emergency and on-call work In return managers will have clearer rights to plan consultants' work and to arrange evening and weekend clinics and operating sessions Alan Milburn the health secretary said the new contract would recognise and reward those who do most for the NHS Pay increments will no longer be automatic Instead they will depend on consultants fulfilling their job plans and accepting extra NHS work where it is offered unless there are good reasons not to For the first seven years newly qualified consultants will be offered up to two extra four-hour sessions a week taking their working week to 48 hours the maximum permitted under the working time directive If they turn them down and do private practice their pay will be frozen at the new starting salary of £63000 costing them £14600 by the end of their first year Managers will also be able to offer existing consultants an extra four-hour session Those who reject it and do private practice will lose increments worth £2000 a year for the first four years with five-yearly sums of £4750 thereafter There will however be no ban on private work and part-time contracts will remain Dr Peter Hawker chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants' committee said the arrangement depended on the NHS being able to afford the extra sessions and provide the staff to support them But he predicted If the work is offered the majority of consultants including surgeons and anaesthetists would accept it  The new contract will have to go out to ballot amid some hostility over the tighter grip it will give managers over consultants' time Richard Rawlins a BMA council member said it put politicians and managers rather than doctors in charge of patient care It did not offer enough to encourage senior consultants to give up private practice but some believed junior colleagues might do so if the NHS work was there at least outside London Labour members of the Commons health committee were disappointed at the lack of a ban challenging Mr Milburn over whether the deal achieved anything They attacked the health secretary's plans for foundation hospitals saying they would lead to a two-tier service damaging other NHS hospitals The big pay increase brought calls from nurses and other staff for similar rises Mr Milburn promised them only a 10 per cent three-year deal to go with reforms of their pay system ,2
2002-04-17, The US administration and senior Senate Republicans said yesterday that failure by Congress to move quickly to pass trade legislation could force the US to reimpose duties next month on many imports from four South American nations including Colombia The threat was the latest in a series of efforts by the administration to revive several trade measures that have been stalled in the Senate since earlier this year These include new fast-track trade negotiating authority for the president and measures to allow duty-free imports on many products from developing countries and from the four Andean nations Colombia Ecuador Peru and Bolivia President George W Bush has urged the Senate to begin debate on the trade bills next week but that appears increasingly unlikely as consideration of another of the administration's priorities energy continues to drag on Trent Lott the Senate Republican leader said yesterday that the administration had no authority to extend the Andean trade benefits beyond May 15 a statement echoed by Don Evans the commerce secretary The Andean bill is an administration priority because it is seen as offering legal alternatives to the cultivation of drugs in countries that export cocaine to the US About one-fifth of the $11bn £7 6bn in exports from those countries to the US enter duty-free under the programme The administration's legal authority to continue duty-free treatment of the imports is unclear Mr Bush extended the measure for 90 days when it would have expired earlier this year even though there was no specific provision in the act allowing him to do so It's sort of understood that the administration won't do it again said an administration official A Senate Democratic aide called it a made-up deadline intended to force Senate action but said there was no possibility of signing the measure into law by May 15 The Andean bill itself would probably pass the Senate without difficulty but Democrats have insisted it be linked to the far more controversial fast-track legislation which would give the president power to negotiate new trade agreements Democrats have said the trade bills can pass only if they are accompanied by measures to expand unemployment assistance and healthcare benefits for workers ,3

2002-06-15, A request by four southern African nations for a lifting of the ban on ivory sales and a Japanese proposal to allow whalemeat exports are expected to produce a stormy debate ahead of a meeting of the United Nations agency that polices trade in endangered species Another request to list two species of toothfish commonly known as Chilean sea bass could give the agency the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Cites an unaccustomed role in controlling trade in commercially valuable fish stocks This has up to now mainly been left to international and regional organisations directly concerned with fisheries management though Cites has had a role in conserving Caspian sturgeon stocks through controls on caviar trade Willem Wijnstekers the Cites secretary-general said yesterday that 54 proposals for amending the list of species subject to trade prohibi tions or controls would be on the agenda when Cites' 158 member governments meet in Santiago Chile in November The Cites secretariat is now seeking comments before making its own recommendations Cites waived its ban on ivory sales in 1997 to allow three African countries Botswana Namibia and Zimbabwe to make one-time sales from existing legal raw ivory stocks These three countries and South Africa are now proposing another one-off sale of existing stocks totalling 70 tonnes followed by regular annual sales of about 13 tonnes which would enable them to sell ivory collected each year from legal culling and natural elephant deaths Zambia is proposing a one-off sale Proponents of relaxing the ban argue that the income will benefit local communities and conservation programmes However environmentalists say a resumption of ivory sales will encourage poaching which almost wiped out the African elephant in many parts of southern Africa before the ban was imposed in the late 1980s A two-thirds majority is required to lift the ban Other proposals include Japan's request to resume trade in whalemeat from Minke and Bryde's whales allowing it to buy Norway's surplus a Cuban request to sell part of its legal stockpile of Hawksbill turtle shells and a plan by Argentina Bolivia and Chile to expand sales of fine silky wool sheared from live vicuna www cites org,3
2002-06-24, The Opec oil producers cartel is expected this week to choose Venezuela's energy minister Alvaro Silva as its next secretary- general partly to try to prevent the Latin American oil-producing country sapping cartel discipline and oil prices Oil prices fell on Friday on reports of increased Venezuelan production with the Brent benchmark crude for August delivery closing 32 cents down on the day at $24 73 in London and West Texas Intermediate ending 13 cents down at $25 82 in New York President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela who has been a loyal supporter of Opec this weekend dismissed as rumour reports that Venezuela was producing more than its current Opec quota of 2 5m barrels per day But Mr Chavez is under financial pressure to make up production lost during the strikes at the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela PDVSA that culminated in the failed coup against him in April In the wake of the 48-hour coup Mr Chavez recalled Ali Rodriguez the former Venezuelan energy minister who is formally resigning as Opec secretary-general this week to head PDVSA Mr Rodriguez is reported to have already ordered a 200000 barrels a day output increase at PDVSA With world oil supply rising still apparently faster than overall oil demand Opec ministers are likely at their regular meeting in Vienna this week to leave unchanged production quotas that have been slashed over the past year However they are expected to keep a Venezuelan as the head of their Vienna secretariat by appointing Mr Silva to serve out the last 18 months of Mr Rodriguez's term Mr Silva whose candidature was announced by Mr Chavez is the only formal runner in the field Mr Rodriguez has used a recent farewell tour of several Opec capitals in the Middle East to lobby for Mr Silva None of Venezuela's 10 Opec partners has named a candidate perhaps fearing a repeat of 2000 when Saudi Arabia Iran and Iraq blocked one another's candidates and eventually compromised on Mr Rodriguez However while there may be agreement that a Venezuelan may replace Mr Rodriguez there are some reservations over Mr Silva who speaks little English and no Arabic Aged 73 Mr Silva is a dour and serious character compared with his predecessor The choice of Mr Silva according to one Opec source is less personal than a strategic imperative to keep Venezuela on board to secure compliance with Opec quotas Oil industry executives in Venezuela remark on his limited diplomatic charm and ideological rigidity As energy minister Mr Silva last year drafted a new hydrocarbons law which raised royalty taxes In the 1990s he opposed the opening up of the oil sector to foreign capital He was also involved in preparing the nationalisation law of 1976 that created PDVSA For more reports see www ft com/globaleconomy,2

appetites whetted by the government selling off the family silver at what seemed to be cheap prices the retail investor went on to add some big brand name companies to the portfolio Later came the heady days of the technology stock boom in 1999 and 2000 The retail investor's interest spread to the TMT sectors technology media and telecommunications You could not open a newspaper or switch on the TV without hearing the latest dotcom success story Even if retail investors avoided buying into internet companies with business plans scribbled on the back of restaurant napkins technology shares were snapped up as they became available A typical retail investor could have ended up with a fairly broad-based portfolio comprising former nationalised companies banking telecoms and technology shares Since the technology bubble burst in March 2000 an investment tracking the FTSE 100 has declined by about 29 per cent How does the typical theoretical portfolio compare The imaginary portfolio could include Railtrack Cable & Wireless BT Group Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy to represent the privatisation element Abbey National covers the investor's interest in banking stocks Vodafone Marconi ARM Holdings and Bookham Technology represent the move further towards TMT It is a stylised but plausible enough list how many of us can honestly say we do not own any of these stocks For simplicity's sake it is assumed that the investor bought Bookham on its market debut in April 2000 The optical networking component maker rose sharply after its launch as retail buyers lined the pockets of institutional investors who sold on some of their share allocations to the eager private investors The starting point for the remaining nine stocks is the end of the first week of March 2000 the last time the investing world looked like a one-way bet to early retirement The last traded price of 280p has been used to value Railtrack now that it appears the government might eventually provide investors with something close to this figure Since March 2000 the portfolio has dropped 55 per cent more than double the loss of the FTSE100 index with eight out of the 10 shares worth less than their starting value Only Abbey National and Scottish and Southern Energy shares are higher than in March 2000 But if you chose to stand out from the crowd the last two years could have been very different One of the emerging themes of the new millennium has been the rise in ethical investing The FTSE4Good index specifically excludes tobacco producers makers of weapon systems and operators of nuclear power stations However if you had entered the millennium not as a politically correct new man but as an unreconstructed investing dinosaur basically James Bond with a penchant for toxic waste your portfolio would have offered greater protection against the market downturn To cover Bond's interest in smoking the politically incorrect portfolio includes British American Tobacco Gallaher and Imperial Tobacco Diageo which owns the Smirnoff vodka brand represents drinking and racecourse operator Arena Leisure and casino group London Clubs International cover Bond's gambling No toxic portfolio would be complete without nuclear power company British Energy and defence contractor BAE Systems The FTSE4Good index does not exclude oil companies but many environmentalists might beg to differ and the politically incorrect team is rounded off with BP and Shell If you are tired of estate agents hogging the limelight as chief pariahs at all right-thinking dinner parties try owning up to shareholdings in this quiver of stocks Once the clamour of righteous indignation has died down point out the returns Over the period from early March 2000 the toxic portfolio has returned an average share price gain of 40 per cent with seven out of the 10 stocks higher than at the starting date There is virtually a 100 per cent difference in performance between the two portfolios Whether your portfolio resembles Mr Typical or Mr Bond the important fact is not whether you are invested in the market but in which parts of it you are invested I believed that macroeconomic recovery would translate into higher share prices and that the FTSE 100 would break up out of its 5000 to 5400 trading range I was wrong and did not foresee the scale of the declines in Vodafone and Glaxo which account for almost half of the FTSE 100's 11 per cent drop this year The fall below 5000 has triggered a wave of sentiment-driven selling targetting last September's lows The selling has accelerated and spread across sectors But beneath the headline index decline the underlying sector performance backs a view based on economic recovery albeit now clouded by Friday's widespread selling The mid-cap index which has a greater weighting of cyclical stocks has outperformed the blue chips and until Tuesday was still up on the year Traditional cyclical stocks in the resources basic industries and consumer goods sectors have delivered positive returns and it has paid to shun technology and telecoms which are among the year's worst performers Stockpicking not index tracking remains the key to this market but if you hold the portfolio from hell take comfort that you are not alone vince heaney@ft com Technology funds Page 7,2
2002-06-22, As unpatriotic as it may seem the sad demise of England's World Cup chances may be just what JD Wetherspoon needed Shares in the pub company which proudly trumpets the fact that is doesn't allow television and music to distract from the serious business of drinking have hit a 12-month low of 313{1/2}p This can be directly attributable to the fact that the British public's new-found thirst for football and its natural companion beer have not both been satisfied by Wetherspoon This has left pub operators with screens to take advantage of the lift in sales that the World Cup has provided The group's high rating of 18 times against the rest of the sector trailing at between 12 and 14 times has also made it more vulnerable to any perceived upsets to current trading But given Wetherspoon's proven formula of affordability pleasant surroundings and good service analysts are confident punters will return after the final whistle blows on June 30 Wise Speke's David Pope has not reduced his full-year 2002 forecast of £53m and believes the share price movement is more to do with perception rather than reality Lisa Urquhart,2
2002-06-14, Archstone Capital is understood to be pulling its investment variously put at $75m to $100m out of Bessent Capital Archstone is understood to have been one of Bessent's largest original investors after Scott Bessent and his family who put $150m into the fund when it launched last year and Soros Fund Management Mr Bessent's former employers who put another $150m into the fund The hedge fund world greeted the launch of Mr Bessent's fund with great excitement While at Soros Mr Bessent racked up average returns of over 30 per cent But he struggled to replicate that performance on his own He lost more than 10 per cent last year and according to investors continues to lose this year Many investors including Soros Fund Management withdrew their money Mr Bessent declined to comment on client matters Archstone is understood to take concentrated bets with big-name hedge funds Many of its other investments have worked out very well The stake in Bessent seems to have been partially a strategy to guarantee future capacity Robert Clow,2
2002-06-24, When Korea starts putting its prized power assets on the block later this year utilities across the world are expected to sit up and pay attention The 10-year privatisation programme will kick off with the sale of five hydro and one nuclear generating subsidiaries which analysts reckon could raise more than Won15000bn $12 3bn These units have been spun off from Korea Electric Power Corporation the monopoly electricity provider that is some 53 per cent government-owned Three other divisions transmission distribution and import and sales will follow later Jay Choi power analyst at Merrill Lynch in Seoul says he fields regular calls from international oil and gas majors about Kepco I believe there's better than expected demand from European energy companies and some private equity firms even from the US despite the Enron crisis he says Certainly the government's steps so far suggest a bold commitment to privatisation When workers staged a five-day strike in late March and early April in protest at the restructuring the government scored a rare victory over the unions by squashing it But there have also been setbacks Parliamentary paralysis exacerbated by the June 13 local elections and deepened by the forthcoming presidential elections in December have caused delays to legislation necessary for the privatisation process The government having seen foreign investors leave the ranks of buyers for nationalised banks is more wary of expecting strong foreign interest than the financial community Kim Dong-won deputy minister for energy and resources policy at the Ministry of Commerce Industry and Energy describes the coming sales as a most delicate problem There are two strong views in society he says One is that people support the idea of attracting foreign investment in order to increase the national interest of our country But on the other hand there is a view led mostly by union leaders who believe if we do open our doors to foreign investment and also sell much more of our backbone industries in Korea it will mean a flight of wealth from Korea  While the government is firmly holding on to the former view for now no decision has yet been reached he says Morgan Stanley believes that foreign buyers could prove in shorter supply with their ranks depleted by the ripple-waves from the Enron collapse While it notes that the generating companies will vie for funds with power privatisations from Singapore the Philippines and China in Asia alone Mr Choi reckons Kepco is among the more attractive assets for sale Either way the government is keeping its options open The possibility of seeking a consortium made up of a local and foreign player would Mr Kim admits present another dilemma In realistic terms if we are thinking of an ideal domestic buyer with lots of money that would be a chaebol But if a chaebol owns one of these subsidiaries it would trigger Korea's decades-long problem which is a concentration of wealth among certain people  Local companies understood to be eyeing the subsidiaries include SK Group LG group and possibly Posco A third option on the table is simply to list the shares on the stock market But this would be a huge amount for the market to absorb and fail to deliver a management to the new company one of the whole points of the exercise Despite this Morgan Stanley reckons this could be the government's most attractive option as financial investors are less exacting about transparent and stable market conditions and an IPO is more politically palatable than selling off a strategic asset at a low price an accusation that has been levelled at government on previous occasions The other big obstacle is the unclear regulatory and pricing environment going forward a situation that may leave too many variables to enable foreign investors to price the assets accurately Investors will be seeking assurances on these issues and Kepco's new financial advisers UBS Warburg JP Morgan and Daewoo Securities are seeking to reassure foreign investors without causing hostility in the home market But early indications suggest they too might be veering towards a joint-buyer scenario Some foreign buyers prefer to take a back seat and go in as part of a consortium says one banker close to the deal ,3
2002-06-04, The European Central Bank will wait for the US Federal Reserve to make the first move in lifting interest rates according to most European economists polled in the latest monthly survey by FT Deutschland The ECB's leading interest rate is currently at 3 25 per cent almost double the Fed's main rate 1 75 its lowest level in four decades There is no reason to hurry for the ECB Inflation keeps falling and the economy is despite a change in mood not clearly out of the woods yet Also the rising euro exchange rate puts pressure on the money markets said Ulrich Beckmann of Deutsche Bank While 18 of 30 strategists taking part in the survey believed the ECB would wait for the Federal Reserve the rest of the participants stressed the need for quick action The ECB is under double pressure Growth perspectives are picking up and recent wage settlements in Germany and other European countries make it unlikely that the ECB is going to achieve its inflation target of 2 per cent said Jorg Kramer of Invenco Asset Management None of the participants expected the ECB to change rates at its next meeting on Thursday and 22 economists did not expect another interest rate increase until the end of August But money market contracts are suggesting that another rate rise was likely by the beginning of July However they suggest that the probability of the Fed raising rates on July 13 are just below 50 per cent Over the last two and a half years money markets were significantly more accurate in predicting European interest rates than economists The main reason for a more cautious opinion for participants in the survey was the recent rise of the euro against the dollar The currency hit the 94 cents mark for the first time The euro's strength is a gift of god said Dieter Wermuth of United Financial of Japan in Frankfurt It weighs down inflation and does not hurt economic growth  For Julian Callow of Credit Suisse First Boston in London another interest rate rise was conditional on the euro not appreciating further Participants were also asked about their expectations for inflation in the eurozone The average opinion was a 0 1 per cent rise compared with last month at 2 2 per cent The average prognosis for 2003 remained unchanged at 2 7 per cent Recent optimism regarding economic growth was dimmed by participants who lowered their forecasts for this year and next On average they expected the eurozone economy to grow by 1 3 per cent in 2002 and by 2 7 per cent in 2003 ,2
2002-06-11, HSBC may be a global contender as a financial services company but it has long punched below its weight in fund management Alain Dromer hired last year to run HSBC's fund management operation knows this and he wants to put it right We were a little like still water he says as he pours a glass of mineral water at HSBC Asset Management's headquarters in London's financial district Now we want to be a little more sparkling  HSBC is certainly ambitious It wants to triple assets under management currently at £138bn $201bn over the next five years Achieving that as markets continue to fall will not be easy But Mr Dromer an animated Frenchmen who formerly ran Credit Commercial de France's fund management business before HSBC acquired the French bank is optimistic Recalling the moment he took charge of the business he says I was fascinated by the size of the group its international reach and its culture of being global and local at the same time  He trots out facts from a briefing paper prepared for analysts HSBC has a strong presence in Europe Asia and Latin America its fund managers are unusually located in 13 offices around the globe in HSBC's banking division it has a ready-made distribution channel for its products This is nothing new so why the confidence that HSBC can break with tradition and make it as a big-time fund management house Mr Dromer points to HSBC's new resolution to position itself as a strategic player in the wealth management industry This he says is founded on the belief that fund management is a growth market with a difference If there was growth but the market shares of fund managers were rigid or allocated already then this would be unattractive to us But there is all to play for  Beyond this are HSBC's expansion plans in Asia Europe and the US He wants to build what he calls HSBC's number one market Hong Kong and greater China HSBC's historic oriental links have been obscured by its vague acronymic name But Mr Dromer intends to trade on its roots as the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation It already has a link with China Southern Fund Management Mr Dromer says HSBC is ready to take advantage of new laws to be introduced this year that would allow foreign fund managers to take a 33 per cent stake in local investment houses Elsewhere in Asia HSBC last year bought a controlling stake in CSIT one of Taiwan's top fund managers and it is preparing to enter India which has great potential as a source of new investors Mr Dromer says there is an application with the regulators for HSBC to be recognised as an official onshore fund manager based in Mumbai HSBC is strong in the UK where it is listed and in France where thanks to the CCF acquisition it controls a 3 5 per cent market share But it plans to grow in Italy Spain Switzerland Scandinavia and especially Germany The place that we have the strongest foothold outside the UK and France is Germany he says That is because of HSBC's German subsidiary HSBC Trinkhaus & Burkhardt Its funds under management about $25bn are not counted in HSBC's $138bn total because its asset management business is for the time being quite separate Are there plans to put them together We are talking yes he says cautiously Overnight it would boost HSBC's funds under management by 18 per cent HSBC faces its toughest challenge in the US Of its position in the world's biggest equity market he says Frankly we are not strong in US large-cap fund management We have to improve our credibility in this area Our performance is not satisfactory  We want to we have to grow the business he says and not only because HSBC is failing to reach US investors European Japanese Chinese investors they are looking for global portfolios and you need to have a very good capability in the US if you want to satisfy their demand  This sounds as if he is building towards a statement about HSBC's plans for an acquisition But Mr Dromer chooses his words carefully An acquisition could be a solution but the fit culturally and technically must be good and there are not many players out there  A more likely option is a hiring spree We already have very good people and we want to beef this up  As well as expanding geographically Mr Dromer is drawing up plans for an expansion of HSBC's product range Top of the agenda is a new company focusing on alternative investments and in particular hedge funds HSBC Asset Management is ordered in three strands a core global active fund management business handling £125bn $182bn of assets specialist companies running $13bn of assets and a multi-manager funds operation In its specialist division it plans to create HSBC Alternative Investments to spearhead its attack on the hedge fund market HSBC has just three hedge funds although it has a large fund of hedge funds business operated by HSBC Republic But isn't it a bit late to be entering the hedge fund business No he says There will be a lot of Darwinian selection because not everything in the hedge fund industry is of superb quality We will have a place consistent with our brand and profile  If as Mr Dromer says HSBC can take its rightful place among the world's big fund managers that would be a long overdue achievement But HSBC's struggle to break into the top tier suggests he should not put the sparkling water let alone the bubbly on ice just yet ,2
2002-04-17, Bernard Parks Los Angeles police chief yesterday confronted the city establishment with charges that he had been ousted from his job by the manipulation of a corrupt appointments system The defiant chief publicly challenged the city council to reject a decision by the police commission not to give him a second five-year term in the job Cheered on by supporters in the packed council chamber the 37-year veteran of the force contrasted his unblemished record with the manoeuvrings of a newly appointed mayor and his newly installed appointees on the police commission Although most council members had already suggested they considered the issue closed Mr Parks took full advantage of his last-ditch effort to put his case directly to the public Surveys have shown two thirds of the electorate approve of his record but Democratic political opinion including Mayor James Hahn the main police union all but one of the five-person police commission and most of the city council oppose him Addressing a visibly nervous council Mr Parks hinted that rejection of his appeal could lead to more violence and murder Mr Parks is the city's second black police chief and his supporters have accused the police union of racism His predecessor who was also black was denied reappointment to a second term Mr Parks known as a stern disciplinarian said that his successes in restoring discipline and reducing corruption would be undermined by the appointment of a less experienced and more compliant successor Mr Parks who has hinted at legal action also suggested city revenues might have been used to support an advertising campaign by the police union The mayor received strong support from the union in last November's close election Mr Parks said he had been told to my shock by the mayor that most of the police commissioners would not back his reappointment even before the selection process started By refusing to go quietly he said he intended to show either that the appointment process could be fair or that the police chief's job could be traded in a political campaign ,3
2002-06-06, England's three most unlikely mayors the men who spoilt Tony Blair's election night a month ago are rapidly having to come to terms with political realities Four weeks on the three north-east leaders are learning the art of compromise as they try to steer the system The trio were not quite the go-getters the prime minister had in mind when he encouraged the election of mayors for England's cities Stuart Drummond was Hartlepool's football mascot Chris Morgan a Conservative elected as mayor for the Labour fortress of North Tyneside and Ray Mallon a police chief whose unorthodox methods earned him the soubriquet Robocop In Hartlepool H'Angus Monkey real name Stuart Drummond has been forced to abandon his promise of free bananas for school children because of financial problems Mr Morgan the new Tory mayor of North Tyneside cold-shouldered by rival politicians has been forced to make difficult decisions over council budget cuts In Middlesbrough Mr Mallon has discovered the art of compromise as he signalled an end to his war with the Labour party The former policeman famed for his zero tolerance approach is taking weekly lessons in politics Mr Mallon nicknamed Robocop during his time has head of Middlesbrough CID has faced a battle with the Labour members who make up 42 of Middlesbrough's 53 councillors In his combative acceptance speech he warned his political opponents to work with him or go Labour councillors seem to have accepted the new political reality Mr Mallon in a display of conciliation has created a councillor executive body in which four out of six are Labour including Labour group leader Paul Thompson Mr Mallon forecasts the three or four Labour councillors resistant to change will just drop off the edge Mr Mallon who had been suspended from his police job admitted 14 disciplinary charges while publicly denying them so he could quit Cleveland police and stand as mayor The annual salary is £30000 less than Hartlepool's and North Tyneside's mayors The council which has a £165m-a-year budget is not in debt but could face problems arising from an industrial tribunal decision regarding redundancies pushed through years ago For months Mr Mallon has been having a weekly one-hour tutorial from a retired politics lecturer Bert Ward Despite his famed zero tolerance he considers himself a democratic socialist He hopes to be mayor for at least his five-year term but adds If after two or three years I think it's not working I won't hang around I will walk  In Hartlepool the first task for Mr Drummond formerly mascot of Hartlepool United football club was to get people to take him seriously The transition from £10000-a-year call centre worker to £53000-a-year first citizen overseeing a £105m budget and 3200 employees would be daunting enough not even taking into account that the council is heading for a £1m deficit next financial year Being an Independent mayor is useful in a council where Labour has nearly half the seats but there is no overall control This has helped the 28-year old select a cross-party cabinet He is much brighter than the monkey suit might have implied applying his mind he has business qualifications to council finance while maintaining his man in the street image by coming to work on the bus and opening meetings to the public Keeping his pledge to improve sports and recreational facilities for young people he has reprieved a sports hall from closure But one election promise haunts him those free bananas for Hartlepool's schoolchildren A banana a day for all at £150000 annually looks unattainable Instead he is hoping to mount a schools healthy eating campaign The sternest test is in North Tyneside where Chris Morgan an accountant will need all the financial acumen he can muster as Tory mayor of the hard-pressed Labour council The Labour and Liberal Democrat groups on the 60-seat council with 33 and 8 councillors respectively have refused involvement in his cabinet all seven appointees are Tory With no honeymoon period his opening weeks have been marked by controversy over where cuts should fall The council had started to implement £11m spending cuts before Mr Morgan a North Tyneside councillor became mayor but he wants to cut a further £6m to stabilise its finances Its budget this year is £196m Even if his proposals go to council Labour cannot block them unless by forming pacts with the Liberal Democrats they can muster opposition from at least two-thirds of councillors Many of the Labour group are finding it hard to come to terms with the fact they can't stop me from doing much says Mr Morgan Even traditional Labour voters are willing to give me a chance  This may be the case now but when the cuts bite how long will it last,3
2002-06-21, When everyone is making money or if it at least looks that way there is little resentment of the side deals that Wall Street cuts for itself If your hedge fund is spitting out 20 or 25 per cent returns each year a few million here or there in expenses laid off on limited partners is just a tip However when quarterly report after report goes by with the general partner admitting a return of less than 1 per cent even the most charitable limited partner begins to wonder if he's getting what he has paid for especially when the media are demanding that erring executives get fifty lashes for their misdeeds While a rhinoceros-hide whip might sound unpleasant to the average hedge fund manager he might prefer it to the alternative now in the works a series of class action lawsuits alleging that managers have abused soft dollar arrangements with their brokers Soft dollars are really hard dollars that are paid by the investor in brokerage commissions through investment managers be they mutual funds hedge funds or any other fiduciary Some of those hard dollars paid invisibly for commissions then get recycled back to the investment manager in the form of free Bloomberg terminals Wall Street research magazine subscriptions industry conferences at golf resorts and so on Much of this is legal under section 28e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which creates a safe harbour for what might look like kickbacks as long as an investment adviser uses the soft dollars for research or execution In addition to the safe harbour category soft dollar payments can be used for other items beneficial to clients as long as adequate disclosure is made If you think this leaves some grey areas you're right I once had a neighbour who made her living as a prostitute To comply with the Upper East Side's informal zoning restrictions she used her Series 7 brokerage license to get paid Money managers would call her to set up assignations In the course of the calls she would offer an opinion on say whether the Fed funds rate would go up or down Not long afterward a trade would be executed using the firm through which she cleared The investor pays for that Apart from my entrepreneurial neighbour's services the last Securities and Exchange Commission survey on the subject also found shortcomings by advisers seeking the protection of the safe harbour with respect to 'mixed-use' items that have both research and non-research uses These included computer hardware telephone expenses rent utilities legal fees travel expenses FedEx concert tickets and limousines The SEC estimated in 1998 that over $1bn in soft dollar commissions are paid annually Apart from the question of whether the firms' Grateful Dead tickets were actually disclosed as soft dollar purchases one has to wonder about the overall efficiency of the process Among the reasons we use cash rather than barter particularly in financial markets is that the transaction costs are lower for cash Any serious investment adviser should be able to get execution for a penny a share or so Soft dollar brokerage commissions which now can include Nasdaq riskless principal trades range from six to twenty or thirty times that rate A lot of inefficiency can hide in those margins Wouldn't it be simpler just to pay a penny a share for commissions and then have the money managers write a check for their research and Bloomberg's and pay my former neighbour in cash If this were Day One and we had never had the structure of fixed commissions before May of 1975 we would be paying for everything with hard dollars says Faith Kolish a hedge fund attorney in New York But the SEC gives mixed signals on the use of soft dollars As Kolish says I am a mutual fund trustee and we get messages from the SEC saying 'make sure you get the maximum benefit from soft dollars to reduce expenses'  One prominent and honest hedge fund manager says Any lawyer is going to have a hard time turning hedge fund limited partners into a class for which a court will show sympathy Not only are they supposed to be sophisticated investors but each hedge fund's documentation is different so you don't have huge classes  I think most soft dollar payments are legal but inefficient The class action lawyers could win by intimidating a couple managers and forcing them to settle out of court Especially if they find my former neighbour's name on a ticket johndizard@hotmail com,2
2002-06-05, Gordon Brown told European Union finance ministers yesterday that Guernsey had joined Jersey in bowing to pressure on the exchange of financial information that is vital for a new savings tax regime in Europe Mr Brown told the Ecofin council in Luxembourg that the agreement of both Channel Islands to comply with new EU rules marked significant progress ending a bitter row lasting months He said that Jersey intended to introduce legis-lation for sharing information on the savings income of EU residents We have been informed by Guernsey that they had also made a full commitment to the exchange of information and plan to introduce similar legislation  The development was welcomed by Frits Bolkestein EU internal market commissioner who admitted that talks with Switzerland on a similar information deal were proving very difficult and that agreement now looked impossible before the EU's June 30 deadline Mr Brown won a long battle to prevent the introduction of an EU-wide withholding tax on non-residents' savings because he feared it would undermine the international bond market Meanwhile France yesterday gave the green light to new laws to allow pension funds to operate across Europe removing the biggest remaining obstacle to the long-awaited reforms But trouble is still looming on the separate issue of the proposed tax and spending plans of Jacques Chirac the French president which threaten to break his commitment to achieve a budget close to balance by 2004 Yesterday's Ecofin meeting ended harmoniously although the most difficult issue the French budget has been put on hold for two weeks until after the French legislative elections Britain is also objecting to the European Commission's demands for spending cuts or tax rises to bring its budget close to balance in 2003-04 on the grounds that the country's public services badly need investment The most significant breakthrough yesterday was on cross-border pensions which will be regulated under a relatively light touch regime championed by the UK and the Netherlands ,3

2002-04-26, A new railway safety system will cost up to £6 5bn and will need government funding rail industry leaders said yesterday The government's Strategic Rail Authority published a cross-industry group's report that recommended a higher level of the proposed European Rail Traffic Management System than previously planned The level 2 version would be in development until 2008 when a national programme would begin to fit it to 29000km of high-speed lines and 9000 trains taking until 2015 Extending the system to the rest of the network would take longer said Richard Bowker authority chairman The cost would be £3 5bn for the high-speed lines and up to £6 5bn for the vast majority of the network said the report Development work will be financed by the authority as part of the £33 5bn 10-year public spending plan The full installation programme much of which would take place after the 10-year plan ends in 2011 would require extra money said Mr Bowker As for how much comes out of the taxpayer how much comes out of the industry that's a debate we have to have he said The recommendations were widely welcomed as realistic by the industry but criticised by some safety and passenger groups They were angry that the industry rejected the 2008 deadline for high-speed lines set by an official inquiry by Professor John Uff and Lord Cullen Carol Bell vice-chairman of the Safety on Trains Action Group said the industry was playing Russian roulette with people's lives Mr Bowker said it was not possible to implement the technology as quickly as recommended by the Uff-Cullen report and the simpler system that they sought would reduce capacity by 10 per cent The more advanced technology would increase capacity by 10 per cent The estimated risk of the delay was nine equivalent fatalities over 40 years Since there's not a material difference in safety we believe the right thing to do is to plan it properly get the technology right said Mr Bowker www sra gov uk/sra/news,3
2002-06-10, Brazil's leftwing Workers' party PT will not abandon the inflation targets that have been a cornerstone of recent macro-economic stability if it comes to power in October's general elections according to Guido Mantega the party's chief economic adviser The claim flatly contradicted a statement by a party economist last week that contributed to nervousness on Brazil's financial markets Although markets recovered some of the ground lost on Friday yield spreads offered by Brazilian bonds above US Treasuries the main measure of political risk ballooned out earlier in the week to more than 12 percentage points and the currency fell by 7 per cent Strong opinion poll showings of the party's presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and fears that the PT would mismanage the economy have undermined investor confidence with inconsistent and often ambiguous economic proposals by party leaders a particular concern Mr Mantega told the Financial Times however that a PT government would target more realistic levels of price increases and would also adhere to the narrower measure of inflation that would exclude short-term variables He also insisted that an administration would do more to promote exports and growth qualifying external vulnerability as the biggest inflationary pressure Mr Mantega blamed errors by the central bank for the sharp recent rise in financial instability The introduction of new accounting regulations that make investment funds mark the value of investments to their end of day levels on the markets created a problem in an already turbulent situation It was a serious mistake that caused an excess dose of adrenalin on the market The rule change led many funds to sell government paper last week It had also been wrong to change the structure of issues that allow investors to hedge against currency risk In addition the central bank should have reduced rather than maintained basic interest rates The party's programme for government due to be announced at the end of this month will try to reconcile the demands of the party's moderate and radical wings Mr Mantega is regarded as a leading moderate A Datafolha survey published yesterday showed Jose Serra the government candidate and principal proponent of economic continuity rising in the polls by 4 points to 21 per cent of voter intention while Mr da Silva fell 3 points to 40 per cent Yet with 48 per cent of voters still undecided polls still provide an inaccurate projection of the election outcome political analysts say ,3

2002-06-21, Jean-Pierre Raffarin the newly-appointed French prime minister plans to announce the partial privatisation of Gaz de France on July 3 the Force Ouvrie`re trade union said yesterday For several months politicians and industry analysts have said GdF would be one of the first state companies to face privatisation after the recent presidential and legislative elections GdF managers are in favour of the move On Wednesday Moody's the credit rating agency said it had cut its outlook on GdF's Aa1 rating from stable to negative because of the likelihood of a partial privatisation As a company backed by the state GdF enjoys high ratings and a low cost of borrowing However the right-wing parties that won the elections were discreet about their privatisation plans during the campaign and this is the first time that anyone has mentioned a date for the GdF announcement Gabriel Gaudy general secretary of the energy sector of the Force Ouvrie`re union sent a letter to Mr Raffarin yesterday condemning the proposed sale of just under half of GdF All the information we have shows that you plan to announce on July 3 in your policy statement to parliament the opening of the capital that is to say the privatisation of Gaz de France probably to the level of 49 9 per cent supported by a stock market flotation says the letter which has been seen by the Financial Times This would be a reversal of the nationalisation decided in 1946 by General de Gaulle Mr Gaudy wrote Mr Gaudy added in an interview that if the Raffarin government did not heed union protests he would call on other unions to join a national strike before the summer holidays ,3
2002-06-19, Today was supposed to be the day the US Treasury Department announced the details of a two-year note auction scheduled for June 26 -a normally routine event in the daily management of the government's debt Instead Treasury officials decided to postpone the announcement wary of proceeding at a time of growing uncertainty about when or indeed if the nation's debt limit will be increased as Paul O'Neill the Treasury secretary has repeatedly requested It was the latest and most concrete sign that juggling the nation's finances has become anything but routine Congress continues to drag its feet on increasing the current $5950bn £4075bn debt ceiling Since last November Mr O'Neill has been pressing Congress to raise the limit by $750bn to accommodate increased government borrowing needs due to growing deficits and shrinking federal tax revenues The Senate has passed legislation to increase it by $450bn and all eyes are now on the Republican-led House of Representatives where the issue has been greeted with about as much enthusiasm as painful dental surgery No one least of all Republicans who pride themselves on being fiscal conservatives wants to go on the record with a highly visible vote to increase the nation's borrowing authority in an election year But the pressure is on House leaders to deal with the matter before Congress recesses next week for the July 4 Independence Day holiday I expect what you'll see is one of those last-minute late-night votes just before Congress goes out for the Fourth of July predicts one long-time Democratic budget aide The financial markets remain convinced that Congress will act in time The postponement of the two-year note announcement suggested that Treasury is living hand to mouth says John Youngdahl a senior economist with Goldman Sachs But like most analysts he does not believe Congress will allow the nation to default on its obligations Still the news of the postponement of the forthcoming debt auction rattled the US bond markets sending prices of shorter-dated securities higher overnight Monday on concerns of a disruption of supply US Treasury bills notes and bonds are auctioned on a regular basis Short-dated bills are auctioned weekly two-year notes monthly while 10-year notes are typically auctioned six times per year About a week before each auction the Treasury issues a press release announcing the security being sold the amount it is selling and the auction date When the Treasury said it was postponing the announcement of the June two-year note auction it said it would not go ahead until it was assured it had sufficient borrowing authority Economists said the Treasury's statement awakened investors to the potential implications of a disruption to the supply of government debt A lot of people didn't have the debt ceiling issue on their radar screen said Stephen Stanley senior market economist at Greenwich Capital Though the Treasury has been shifting some funds to avoid hitting the debt ceiling those manoeuvres will not be useful much longer The government will have to make $67bn in semi-annual interest payments to Social Security and other federal trust funds on June 28 an amount that is too big to be handled by Treasury's current options In addition the markets have begun to worry about the prospect of a short-term extension that could see Congress resume fighting later this year Traders have also begun to assess the implications of a delayed resolution for foreign investors who hold large amounts of US government and corporate bonds The more uncertainty there is the more nervous people are said John Roberts head of government bond trading at Barclays Capital He said a delayed resolution could lead to foreigners selling US securities and contribute to a further weakening of the US dollar ,3
2002-06-08, Judging takeovers is one of the trickiest tasks in investing Many investors benefit from a surprise takeover of a company in which they own shares But those who accept a share swap rather than taking a cash alternative or selling in the market need to be convinced that the new management knows what it is doing Moreover shareholders in the company making the bid are frequently caught in a bind News of a big takeover usually knocks a bidder's shares so voting with your feet comes at a price Even though there is consistent evidence that most takeovers fail to add long-term value to the acquirer many shareholders are swept along by management's breathless predictions of growth and profits Some companies live eat and breathe takeovers and shareholders know what to expect Investors in Hanson Trust in the 1980s knew Lord Hanson specialised in buying understandable and easily-run aggregate and basic materials firms Similarly Bernie Ebber's WorldCom did the same in the US telecommunications industry in the 1990s Once a firm has established a growth track record sustaining it through acquisitions funded by shares becomes simple mathematics because highly rated shares can be used to buy more lowly rated ones see box The same mathematics proves however that progressively larger acquisitions are needed to sustain growth in earnings per share If a company is relying on takeovers to build itself up artificially when the underlying businesses are not growing it will eventually run up against limits Change in control of a company is an industrial and managerial process as well as a financial one Even years after a takeover managers who are paid to run a business are instead often tied up integrating incompatible computer systems trying to lift employee morale or struggling with rival political fiefdoms These issues rarely surface in the press but they are a drag on business efficiency and filter down to the bottom line A study by KPMG the accountancy firm this year showed that 30 per cent of high-profile cross-border tie-ups agreed between 1996 and 1998 were being dismantled while two-thirds have yet to be fully integrated So for investors takeovers can be fraught with pitfalls They can be divided into three types business fit savings and the most troublesome value If an aerospace firm buys in quick succession a property company a troubled UK carmaker and a Dutch dredging and building company investors might question how well these companies fit together and add value Yet that is exactly what British Aerospace did in the 1980s with its purchases of Arlington Securities Rover Group and Ballast Needam Predictably after a sustained share price fall most of the businesses were sold off Cross-border takeovers add an extra layer of complexity Not only can managerial cultures fail to mix sometimes even language is a problem DIY retailer Kingfisher and its French affiliate Castorama are in the same business but the respective UK and French managers do not speak the same language so meetings are conducted through a translator Whether a full takeover will solve this remains to be seen When a business fit is good the benefits arrive first in cost savings Economies of scale through joint purchasing eliminating a head office and integrating factories are the tangible gains held out to shareholders But on top of this are often promised synergies which are usually revenue gains Examples include using an existing sales force or branches to sell additional products which is the keystone to the bancassurance model of bank/insurer mergers and an important element in many pharmaceutical mergers At the time a takeover is announced the savings proclaimed are little more than guesswork Many of the failed mergers such as Siebe's 1999 purchase of BTR to form Invensys end up cutting beyond corporate fat and into the business flesh to make the promised numbers stack up This is where value kicks in However well two businesses fit together overpaying can ruin the proposition for the acquirer either by loading it with huge debts or by diluting earnings through excessive issuing of new shares Investors therefore need to recognise overpayment The first step is to establish the net asset value of the company being bought which is in effect the car boot sale value of everything it owns minus its debts NAV usually surfaces in the press coverage of a bid or if not can be found in brokers' reports available on various websites Clearly NAV accords no value to the business as a going concern but if the bid value barely exceeds NAV then there is cause for optimism that the acquirer is not overpaying At the opposite end of the scale was Cisco's acquisition of optical networking vendor Cerant in 2000 for $6 9bn £4 72bn Cerant had barely $10m in revenues which means the internet equipment company paid thousands of times NAV However at the peak of the dotcom bubble such transactions were seen as necessary to buy up the latest ideas In the UK purchasers must record the excess paid over NAV as goodwill on the balance sheet and it is against goodwill that any later write-offs are made in effect conceding too much was paid For the private investor staying aboard after a big takeover means taking a lot on trust The simpler a transaction is the smaller the premium to proven value and the smaller the firm acquired relative to the size of the acquirer the more comfortable they appear Finally it falls to management to show that they have the skill the experience and the time to make one plus one equal three Nick Louth is an active investor www kpmgconsulting co uk www hemscott net,1
2002-06-19, If Germany's politicians are to be believed the future of the coun try's troubled Mittelstandcom panies lies firmly in their hands As Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and his conservative opponent Edmund Stoiber limber up for September's elections prospects for the 3 3m small and medium-sized companies long seen as the backbone of the country's economy are near the top of the political agenda In April Mr Schroder promised to create a public sector bank geared to the financial needs of Mittelstand companies Mr Stoiber countered with pledges ranging from lower taxes and new investment programmes to the deployment of business angels The politicians' attention is understandable A third of all Mittelstand companies operated in the red last year hemmed in by high costs and weak demand Another third barely made a profit In 500000 family-owned Mittelstand companies generational change in the next five years will cause uncertainty Insolvencies are also on the rise Despite such problems the sector's bakers and ball-bearing makers are likely to be the main engine of employment growth when Germany's economic recovery kicks in Such companies their employees and suppliers will also be a vital source of votes in September Yet despite the politicians' gestures the future of the Mittelstand lies less in their hands than in the boardrooms of Germany's banks In a move designed to improve their own profitability the banks the traditional source of paternalistic support for Mittelstand companies have in the past two years imposed an effective credit squeeze aimed at reining in Mittelstand loans that bear high risks but yield low returns The resulting financing crisis has reached a new intensity with more complaints about access to credit and signals that the banks are unwilling to change tack With the government also criticising banks' lending practices the question of how this stand-off is to be resolved is set to deter-mine many companies' survival prospects In a recent survey by the KfW a government-owned financing agency that supports Mittelstand companies 32 per cent of companies said access to bank credits had become more difficult compared with 3 3 per cent that said it had become easier The problem has spiralled into a crisis because of the Mittelstand's traditional over-reliance on long-term low-cost bank finance Many small and medium-sized companies have equity capital ratios of less than 10 per cent admits Mario Ohoven president of Germany's largest association of Mittelstand companies and head of a Dusseldorf-based financial services company The average equity capital ratio in SMEs in Germany in the late 1990s was 18 per cent compared with 40 per cent in the US according to a study this month by the Cologne-based IW economic institute This has certainly been our Achilles' heel Mr Ohoven says Sensitive to the fact the election is approaching Werner Muller economics minister is now offering the Mittelstand strong backing The banks have in effect broken an agreement in 2000 to support the Mittelstand he says Since then the complaints from the Mittelstand have not receded but have become louder he says The private banks would lose some of their acceptance in society if they withdraw from the financing of over 3m companies  Mr Ohoven welcomes what he sees as Mr Muller's straight-talking I'm confident the banks will change their approach  The German banking industry sees things differently The big commercial banks which wrote off billions in loan losses by Mittelstand companies last year say they need to cut back on lending to Mittelstand companies because it no longer pays Deutsche Bank Germany's biggest bank last month signalled its aim of further curbing credits to mid-sized corporates Last year total lending fell more than 11 per cent Commerzbank Dresdner Bank and HVB Group have also warned corporate clients that loans and financial services will become more expensive Deutsche Bank insists that margins on mid-cap lending are just too low They cannot raise them because of intense competition in the German banking market There's always someone willing to lend money says Thomas Duhnkrack of Deutsche Not only are there more than 2000 banks in Germany but many of them are state-controlled and benefit from state guarantees that enable them to raise cheaper funds in the market and undercut rivals But the public sector banks that have been left to pick up the commercial banks' less profitable borrowers are also under pressure to adopt a more market-oriented approach to lending Last year's landmark agreement between Brussels and Berlin on phasing out state guarantees by 2005 will in the long-run force public sector banks to boost their profitability by focusing on sales of higher margin financial products The public sector will also have to prepare for Basel II a rewrite of the global rules governing how banks set aside capital to cover risks It will force all banks to distinguish more rigorously between good and bad risks among Mittelstand companies and allocate capital accordingly Riskier clients will face higher borrowing costs or be refused credit altogether say bankers On Basel II Mittelstand companies are hoping pressure from Berlin will result in revisions in the risk rating system to take fuller account of assets typical of SMEs such as land and property More generally the Mittelstand is resigned to having to rely on even greater support from the public sector Hans Reich KfW chairman says we have to make sure the Mittelstand can find the long-term financing they need To secure that access the KfW last year acquired a 30 per cent stake in listed Deutsche Industriebank IKB a specialist lender to the Mittelstand The IKB already accounted for 40 per cent of our lending activity with SMEs says Mr Reich We had to make sure this outlet was not cut off by a rival banking group  Mr Muller says the IKB could become the Mittelstand's bank as proposed by Mr Schroder The bank could help distribute the {XEU}15bn £9 6bn in cheap credits that the government makes available annually to SMEs Private banks are no longer interested in this business he says Bankers argue that these moves do not tackle the roots of the problem Bernd Fahrholz chairman of Dresdner Bank says the Mittelstand's heavy reliance on lending in whatever form has long been its main weakness Loans are a necessary part of corporate finance but loans cannot be permitted to assume the role of risk-bearing equity  Rolf Breuer outgoing chairman of Deutsche Bank echoes this view It is not the job of a private sector bank to replace the Mittelstand's lack of equity with long-term debt  This view is beginning to sink in with Mittelstand companies We must improve our equity base says Arend Oetker the vice-president of the BDI industry federation responsible for Mittelstand issues How to do this remains an open question Karl Lichtblau of the IW economics institute says The Mittelstand is in transition Many are in a dilemma in order to increase their equity base they need much greater openness but this in turn would require a complete change of thinking in many companies  Larger mid-sized companies are planning on greater access to the public debt and equity markets although first they will have to make themselves more attractive to investors That will mean increasing financial transparency and complying with international accounting rules say bankers Tightly controlled Mittelstand companies will also have to lose their fear of outside investors willing to take an equity stake Several of the biggest Mittelstand companies are hoping to tap Europe's bond markets Others are attracting investment from private equity funds The KfW is developing a loan securitisation scheme which gives small companies indirect access to the capital markets and launching a new private equity programme Bankers argue that few of these financing avenues would have appeared if the cheap loans had kept on flowing Despite the cries of pain from the Mittelstand bankers believe their strong medicine is more effective than the painkillers the politicians will be handing out until September ,3
2002-04-03, Mitsubishi Motors the Japanese carmaker 37 per cent owned by DaimlerChrysler is considering spinning off its truck and bus operation to raise cash and pay down debt according to bankers It is understood DaimlerChrysler may take a 30 per cent stake in the company leaving MMC with about 70 per cent half of which may be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange next year The proposal to spin off Mitsubishi Fuso comes after DaimlerChrysler last week increased its influence at MMC by nominating as president its long-term executive Rolf Eckrodt MMC's former chief operating officer The deal will give DaimlerChrysler greater access to the Asian truck market where Fuso is well established It should also provide both companies with significant cost cutting opportunities analysts said and raise much-needed cash for MMC The company has total net automotive debt of around Y1000bn $7 8bn and is still struggling to rebuild sales of its brand-damaged cars after a global recall and a related scandal in which customer complaints were covered up MMC has been planning to spin off Fuso since the Swedish truck maker Volvo bought a 3 per cent stake agreed to acquire a further 19 9 per cent of Fuso and to list it separately However the deal collapsed after DaimlerChrysler took its strategic stake in MMC in 2000 and balked at selling a fifth of Fuso to its Swedish rival Volvo subsequently sold its stake in MMC to DaimlerChrysler Howard Smith car analyst at ING Barings said Volvo had agreed to pay Y35 9bn for the 19 9 per cent stake of Fuso indicating that the company had a value of about Y200bn a figure unlikely to have altered significantly given Fuso's unchanged debt and broadly flat sales of about 140000 units a year Based on this MMC could expect a Y70bn cash injection if DaimlerChrysler takes 30 per cent of the company and MMC lists half its 70 per cent holding An official at MMC in Tokyo declined to comment on the proposed spin-off but said one of the main benefits for Fuso from a deeper relationship with DaimlerChrysler would be access to the German company's environmental technology It is understood that Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt has been appointed an adviser on the proposed spin-off Goldman advised Daimler on its merger with Chrysler www ft com/autos,1
2002-06-22, It is always difficult to take the helm at a fund that has been managed for many years by one of your colleagues Add the fact that the fund is one of your company's flagships and that it has hardly delivered top-flight performance in the recent past Yet Tom Dobell doesn't appear worried by the responsibility of looking after M&G's Recovery Fund This is one of the UK's largest unit trusts with more than £1 1bn under management and with 100000 unit-holders who until recently despaired of ever seeing their fund delivering the kind of returns they were accustomed to in the 1980s and early 1990s The Recovery Fund launched in 1969 is one of M&G's oldest and for a long time most successful unit trusts It has only ever had three managers David Tucker who launched it Richard Hughes who took over in 1986 and Dobell his replacement in March 2000 Dobell acknowledges the fund's totemic role for M&G It's a great fund with an enormous amount of goodwill towards it from many unitholders who have made huge capital gains over the years from it  By the time he replaced Richard Hughes however M&G Recovery was holed below the line After almost a decade of top-flight performance the fund languished for several years in the third or fourth quartile among more than 300 funds in the UK Growth sector at a time when world stock markets roared ahead Tom Dobell's appointment was brave in more ways than one Not only is he not the star many would expect to be running M&G Recovery this is his first experience as a retail fund manager after many years spent in the institutional sector Aged 37 he is also at first sight an unlikely convert to the world of finance He studied agriculture and intended to follow his family into farming I realised after about two years that there wasn't a great future in farming from the financial point of view Farming is a 30-year cycle and I was born 15 or 20 years too late  After a year travelling round the world Dobell returned home and found a job initially working for Philips & Drew In 1992 he joined M&G still on the institutional side Two years ago after several years of under-performance and with investors beginning to lose patience control of the Recovery Fund passed to Dobell He says the problem was less with the previous management style than the fact the Recovery Fund was finding difficulties operating in the prevailing economic cycle Rather like farming the stock market moves in seven-year cycles and I think we went through a prolonged cycle where economic conditions worked against the objectives of the fund The fund is seeking to look out for companies in trouble and for a long period there were quite boring benign conditions My friend Richard Hughes the previous incumbent was confronted with a choice either of changing the basis of a successful formula or sticking it out and he chose the latter  In spite of his careful praise for Richard Hughes Dobell has altered the structure of the Recovery Fund expanding the number of holdings from 70 or so to about 95 One of the problems we had about five years ago is that we became too focused on narrow parts of the UK market that didn't help us very much For instance we were too knowledgeable about manufacturing Today you have to be a little more broad to be successful The emphasis has shifted away from FTSE 100 companies back to mid-and small-cap stocks We are looking for companies that have the potential to recover and we have introduced overseas holdings where we think we understand what is going on They were always there but now constitute about 5 per cent of the portfolio Our target holding period is three to five years We are looking for companies in trouble that are misunderstood and have been neglected by the market Where we can and have identified a reason for this and can see a way for the company to come back we will invest The game is all about buying low and selling high  Dobell claims running the Recovery Fund is enormous fun and compares it with cricket It is constantly changing Things are going on all round the field that make it worthwhile particularly if you get it right If you get it wrong it can be humiliating and the downside is that you make a fool of yourself But the upside is that you can confound the market  Despite this Dobell says he hates the emphasis on so-called star managers I dislike that term It is very emotive irritating and misleading We operate quite unlike that at M&G We work as a team support each other and pass ideas on to each other I would much rather that the figures spoke for themselves and allow people to make their own minds up The story should sell itself without putting an individual on a pedestal  The effect of Dobell's management is slowly starting to be felt Comparisons are dangerous of course but at a turbulent time for stock markets worldwide the Recovery Fund has gradually gained back some of its lost performance Figures from Trustnet the online funds database show that in the two years or so that he has been in charge the fund has broadly managed to hold its own at a time of quite catastrophic falls elsewhere in the market In the three months to Friday June 14 while the FTSE All Share dropped by 10 3 per cent M&G Recovery lost 4 1 per cent In the past six months the Recovery fund dropped 1 6 per cent overall against the All-Share's 6 2 per cent Over 12 months the fund's fall in value has been broadly in line with the All Share but the year before that it rose by 4 per cent against a fall by the FTSE of 10 3 per cent On the face of it Dobell appears to have steered one of the great funds in the UK sector out of danger He may hate the term but if he succeeds in turning round the M&G Recovery flagship 100000 investors will be hailing him a star If he doesn't the captain is likely to go down with the ship ,1

2002-06-21, Brilliance China the minibus maker which has seen its share price plummet in recent weeks said yesterday that Yang Rong its president chairman and key stakeholder had been replaced However it left the circumstances of his departure a mystery Mr Yang has been the subject of an investigation into suspected asset-stripping within the complex Brilliance group which is incorporated in Bermuda The investigations have lapsed while authorities collate their findings but Mr Yang has been told to stand by for more questions at any time official sources said Mr Yang remains a director of the company he founded in the early 1990s Brilliance has denied that Mr Yang was being investigated but has not explained why China's third-richest man has not answered media enquiries since reports this month sparked a slide in the share price Late on Wednesday company executives who gave a briefing to analysts in Hong Kong said the board had removed Mr Yang because his goals and views were no longer in line with those of the shareholders Neither they nor the company explained yesterday in what ways Mr Yang's goals had diverged The company's share price fell 2 65 per cent to HK$1 10 yesterday but recouped most of a 9 per cent loss in early trade that followed news of Mr Yang's demotion Other members of the board have been promoted A sense that despite Mr Yang's troubles the company appears on an even keel was reinforced by remarks from Brilliance executives that a stalled joint venture with BMW the German carmaker was close to approval by Chinese authorities The companies have been waiting approval for well over a year The reason for the delay from China's State Council its cabinet has been unclear but a go-ahead would constitute official approval for the company despite investigations into individuals Brilliance said there was no change in the shareholding structure of the company Chinese Financial Education Development Foundation controlled by the central bank remained the majority shareholder with 39 45 per cent Company executives gave no details on who owned the shares in the foundation One topic of the official investigations has been why Mr Yang one of China's most respected businessmen failed to carry out in full an internal 1999 finance ministry decree that ordered the transfer of the 55 per cent stake in Brilliance then held by the foundation to Zhongjin Fengde an asset management company owned by the finance ministry ,2
2002-06-18, From Mr Takeshi Uera Sir The views expressed in your articles Nikkei was manipulated by Japan say banks and Shadow management June 13 appeared to be based on misunderstandings of the policies of the Financial Services Agency of Japan It would be quite regrettable if a reporter or others in the markets had not recognised the policies developed in recent months First you quote a remark by a banker that the FSA appears to be discriminating against foreign banks or foreign brokers Under our policy no discrimination is made between domestic and international brokers The administrative action has been taken after the due process Some of the identified violations of the law if ignored would substantially undermine confidence in the Japanese securities markets Many of the companies have published their intention to address the problems Second the FSA does not view short selling as a vice but as an important element in enlarging the depth of a securities market Your article implies that the newly introduced uptick rule is a unique rule that makes it impossible to short sell in a falling market This is not true this rule has its foundation in US securities regulation and is observed by every big international broker conducting business in the US You also give the impression that without a Tokyo Stock Exchange technological safety net there was a strong chance that brokers could be severely penalised for minor technical violations This is entirely misleading Before the introduction of the uptick rule the TSE issued a release to all member firms including international brokers which outlined a de facto safe harbour rule making it possible to avoid accidental violation of the newly introduced rule Moreover let me also point out that there was no significant change in the volume of short sells including margin transaction before and after the introduction of the new uptick rule Last the FSA has no intention of influencing or manipulating the market or any kind of stock price Takeshi Uera Director Office of Public Relations Financial Services Agency Government of Japan Tokyo Japan,2
2002-06-10, Investigators at the Manhattan District Attorney's office which last week indicted Tyco chief executive Dennis Kozlowski on charges of tax evasion are re-examining a 1997 property deal between Tyco and Lord Ashcroft the former British Conservative party treasurer According to people familiar with the matter investigators are scrutinising the sale of a house in Boca Raton Florida to a Tyco executive The transaction came shortly after the US industrial conglomerate completed the $5 4bn £3 7bn purchase of ADT Lord Ashcroft's security company The district attorney's office examined the transaction several years ago but renewed its interest following Mr Kozlowski's indictment on charges of evading taxes on $13m of art purchases The new strand of the investigation first reported by the New York Times comes as Tyco's board attempts to restore investor confidence after its shares fell more than 40 per cent Tyco officials hope the Securities and Exchange Commission will in the next few days allow the company to go ahead with the initial public offering of its CIT financial services arm The IPO is crucial to reducing Tyco's heavy debt load and stabilising finances Tyco's credit ratings were cut on Friday Ratings agencies have warned any IPO delay could lead to further downgrades Tyco hoped for approval last week It claims the process was held up by the issue of adjusting goodwill related to Tyco's purchase of CIT last year Tyco paid $9 5bn in cash and stock and is carrying more than $6bn of goodwill on its balance sheet related to the deal But the IPO is expected to value CIT at $5bn or less forcing Tyco to take a large charge against earnings John Fort the former Tyco executive who resumed control following Mr Kozlowski's resignation is also this week expected to outline changes to the company's corporate governance One matter unresolved is whether the Tyco board knew the company had purchased an $18 5m Fifth Avenue apartment in New York on behalf of Mr Kozlowski in 2000 Investigators say that if the board knew about the transaction it may not have been properly disclosed to investors If the board was not informed this would raise serious questions about Tyco's financial and management controls According to people close to the investigation Lord Ashcroft sold the Florida house to his wife in October 1997 for $100 On the same day she sold it to Byron Kalogerou a senior Tyco executive for $2 5m It now appears that the house was purchased using Tyco funds The deal may not have been properly disclosed in Tyco's financial statements A spokesman for Lord Ashcroft a Tyco director since the ADT deal referred calls to Tyco Stephen Kaufman Mr Kozlowski's lawyer declined to comment A Tyco spokesman said the property deals would be covered by the company's internal investigation There are transactions under the company's employee relocation and company-owned apartments programme We are looking at these transactions  Trouble in Bermuda Page 24 www ft com/tyco,1
2002-06-29, Japan's industrial production driven largely by exports continued to boost the economy in May although domestic demand remained weak according to official figures released yesterday Japan's industrial production rose 3 9 per cent in May month-on-month better than expected and the fourth monthly increase led by higher output of electrical and general machinery and transport equipment Although it declined compared with May last year the rate of decline 2 2 per cent was slower than in April The data put industrial production on track to post its biggest quarterly increase in decades Growth of 3 9 per cent in a single month is very unusual having been bettered only once in the past 40 years said Richard Jerram chief economist at ING Baring Presumably this will be revised lower when the series is'smoothed' at a later date but the effect will only be to redistribute the May growth to other months and the strong trend will remain unchanged  The data strengthened expectations that the Bank of Japan's closely-followed Tankan survey of business sentiment will confirm a gradual improvement with confidence boosted particularly by exports to Asia and the US The improvement will be biggest for large manufacturers because they're the beneficiaries here said Chris Walker economist with Credit Suisse First Boston The economy pulled out of recession and grew at 5 7 per cent a year between January and March the fastest growth in two years But the export-led recovery could be hurt by the strengthening yen which increases the price of Japanese goods overseas The Japanese government has intervened several times recently in the currency market to weaken the yen The yen traded at Y118 5 to the dollar yesterday up more than 10 per cent from the start of the year Japan is also sensitive to the vagaries of the US economy its largest trading partner But economists believe the US is on a path to grow 2 to 3 per cent this year which in the words of Mr Walker should be enough to pull Japan along nicely Japan's economic recovery remains vulnerable to deflation and weak domestic demand Consumer prices fell 0 8 per cent in May year-on-year the 32nd month of decline while unemployment rose for the first time in five months to 5 4 per cent close to the December record high of 5 5 per cent Unemployment has hovered above 5 per cent for nearly a year and continues to undermine consumer spending Expenditure by wage-earners' households fell 0 4 per cent on the year But the increase in production may be feeding into the jobs market with the number of vacancies available at official job centres increasing for a third month ,2
2002-06-05, When the Warsaw Stock Exchange was on its giddy rally through much of the 1990s ITI Group was the wallflower at the party Poland's leading entertainment group repeatedly delayed plans to list foiled by the emerging markets crisis of 1998 the tech-stock crash of 2000 and the advertising downturn that followed last year's terrorist attacks on the US Now with Poland's stock market in decidedly less-frothy mode Luxembourg-listed ITI is heading for its Warsaw debut The company gained approval last month from the Warsaw stock exchange and securities commission and managers are expected today to decide on details of an initial public offering tentatively slated for July The IPO will be one of eastern Europe's most closely watched stock issues this year ITI is one of Poland's oldest and largest entrepreneur-run companies with interests in television film and TV production multiplex cinemas and new media TVN its flagship station broadcasts the popular Polish versions of Big Brother and Who Wants to be a Millionaire  The company launched Poland's first 24-hour news channel last August and controls Onet pl the country's leading internet portal Analysts say the IPO is a litmus test for the moribund Warsaw market where no big companies have listed since 2000 and daily turnover has tumbled to a mere $25m-$30m Publicly traded media companies are few with Agora publisher of daily Gazeta Wyborcza the only company of size on the Polish market This is going to be an important offering says Pawel Szymanski head of Polish country research with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London However he adds Investors don't know much about them In this market they will be scrutinised quite closely  In a sign of ITI's resolve to pursue the IPO the company this week agreed to acquire SBS Broadcasting's 33 per cent stake in TVN for $150m cash and ITI's holding of 666666 common shares of SBS Between $50m and $100m of the purchase price would come from the IPO However the offer faces scepticism surrounding media companies globally and the Poland in particular where the rapid GDP growth of the past decade is not forecast to return until 2004 at the earliest Little public information is available on the company and its complex structure which includes several joint ventures makes it challenging to analyse Against that ITI's managers and analysts alike say television has weathered Poland's advertising downturn better than other media TVN and sister channels TVN 24 and TVN7 target Poland's middle classes and new rich groups less likely to cut spending in a slowdown The company reported consolidated sales last year of $134m down nearly 9 per cent on 2000 Jan Wejchert president and chief executive points out that the company has international audits stretching back to 1989 prehistory by Polish standards ITI's complex structure is nothing he says compared with much larger global peers such as Bertelsmann or News Corp Mr Wejchert and his business partner Mariusz Walter started the company in 1984 registering in Luxembourg because of communist-era curbs on private enterprise Starting in consumer electronics imports home videos and salty-snacks the company refocused on entertainment and media after the collapse of communism ITI went public in Luxembourg in 1997 That listing values the company at just $280m but managers and analysts agree that low liquidity makes it a poor indicator of ITI's value in an interview last year before the global shakeout in telecoms and media stocks Mr Wejchert estimated the company's value at roughly $1bn The regulatory permit allows ITI to list anytime by the end of 2002 and is renewable A Warsaw listing would increase the company's liquidity and allow small investors to exit Mr Wejchert says Analysts say the success of the Warsaw offer will depend in large part on how it is priced If they get the price right it should be attractive says SSSB's Mr Szymanski If it is set too high it could be a problem ,2
2002-06-01, Strong economic data that painted a hopeful picture of a rebounding economy brought a halt to the US Treasury market's rally yesterday sending prices lower Treasury prices had risen steadily over the week as a weak labour report and ongoing geopolitical tensions encouraged investors to favour stocks over bonds Yesterday however there were signs the manufacturing sector may be reviving quickly with the Chicago Purchasing Managers index posting the strongest reading in three years April factory orders were also stronger than expected while the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was revised higher to 96 9 the best reading since 2000 The 10-year bond lost {1/8} to 98{11/16} to yield 4 043 per cent while the 30-year bond was {11/32} lower to 96{7/16} to yield 5 624 per cent The two-year note was down {3/32} to 100{1/16} to yield 3 210 per cent Eurozone government bonds prices ended the week at the same levels at which they had started after having reacted to volatile equity markets throughout a week which offered little by way of significant economic indicators Yesterday bond prices lost ground as investors shyed away from safe-haven debt in the afternoon on the back of the strong manufacturing data from the US In late trading the two-year German schatz yield was up 2 4 basis points at 4 217 per cent while the 10-year German bund yield settled up 2 basis points at 5 152 per cent just 1 basis point below what it was on Monday In the futures market the 10-year German bund futures contract price was up 0 20 to 105 97 Eurozone bond investors will now be turning their attention to Thursday's ECB decision on interest rates analysts said A surprise rise in interest rates should hurt bond prices UK gilt prices fell yesterday in line with eurozone and US markets The 10-year gilt yield was up 3 4 basis points at 5 268 per cent in late trading Japanese government bonds edged higher yesterday after Moody's Investors Service the credit-rating agency finally announced a decision on its review of Japan's sovereign debt Markets were unruffled by Moody's well-flagged decision to lower Japan's debt-rating by two notches from Aa3 to A2 The move analysts said has removed a concern that has been dogging investors for several months Traders were also relieved by Moody's decision to give JGBs a stable outlook defusing concerns of further downgrade actions In the coming weeks the market will be focusing on the extent of Japan's cyclical recovery The key June 10 year futures fell 0 093 to 139 01 while the benchmark 239th cash 10 year JGB gained 0 044 to 100 132 pushing down the yield 0 005 to 1 385 per cent ,2
2002-06-06, Senior executives at US media companies are scouring the UK broadcasting landscape for ways to exploit possible relaxation of British foreign ownership rules Bob Wright chairman and chief executive of NBC was in London last week to look for potential deals He said he was heartened by the new viewpoint towards media ownership When the prime minister of Great Britain stands up and says 'we're supporting dramatic changes in the ownership laws in this country because we really want to see a broader ownership base' you have to pay attention to that Mr Wright said in an interview It doesn't happen very often  However he cautioned that NBC the broadcasting network owned by General Electric had been thwarted before in attempts to expand globally We had NBC Asia and NBC Europe in the early 90s and we got punished he said More recently the company's international strategy has centred on CNBC the business channel In May a draft communications bill was presented to the UK parliament that proposed lifting the rules barring US companies from buying the UK's main television and radio businesses It will take about 14 months before the communications bill becomes law but some UK media shares rose after it was introduced Mel Karmazin president and chief operating officer of Viacom indicated this week he would be interested in buying UK assets at the right price Some of Viacom's cable channels including MTV and Nickelodeon are already familiar in the UK Viacom also owns radio stations through its Infinity unit The stocks of all these companies have run up on the basis that an American media company will buy them Mr Karmazin said at a conference this week We don't need anything out there    enough to overpay for it  Mr Karmazin and Richard Bressler chief financial officer plan to be in London next week A spokesman for Viacom said the two were planning to speak at an investment conference and cautioned against reading more into the trip AOL Time Warner the world's largest media company appears less engaged AOL Time Warner carries over $27bn in debt and has seen its financial flexibility erode this year Wayne Pace the company's chief financial officer said yesterday that AOL Time Warner was focused more on maintaining its investment-grade credit rating than on making acquisitions ,2
2002-06-13, The voting age should be lowered to 16 for local government elections and 18-year-olds should be allowed to become councillors the government will be told by an independent commission today The Commission on Local Governance set up to find ways of revitalising English councils and raising voter turnout will say that fundamental reforms are needed to make the system work Its report Free to Differ will call for an act of parliament setting out the principles of local democracy and giving councils greater control over their financial affairs including the possibility of local income taxes The commission which includes 14 academic and professional experts on local government was set up under the auspices of the Local Government Information Unit an independent research organisation supported by 150 councils Its report says government reform plans set out in a white paper in December and a draft bill yesterday will not succeed in creating strong local government without a genuine transfer of resources It says attempts to reverse a long-term decline in voter turnout by piloting alternative voting methods such as electronic voting are welcome but amount to little more than tinkering with the system Most importantly the report says the government must give councils real power over financial decisions and make politics come alive for young people by lowering the voting age from 18 and the minimum age for candidates from 21 Unless councils can exercise local discretion electors may well believe there is little point in exercising their vote the report says Its 66 recommendations include  powers for councils to pilot proportional representation  paid leave from employment for councillors with employers recompensed by central government  scrapping of incentives for councils to use private finance initiative schemes  return of business rates to local control providing a substantial source of revenue for councils  a review of the scope for local income taxes possibly in conjunction with regional government ,3
2002-06-17, Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse has long been regarded as the home of the gnomes of Zurich the secretive money managers whose financial power used to move the world's foreign exchange markets But the Bahn- hofstrasse is no longer the first port of call for international investors seeking Switzerland's smartest money managers Geneva Switzerland's other main financial centre where Bernie Cornfeld the fund manager who served 11 months in a Swiss prison in the early 1970s for charges relating to his infamous Investors Overseas Services fund of funds empire operated still attracts some more adventurous managers But up-and-coming Swiss fund managers are now more likely to be found tucked away in relatively unknown Swiss towns such as Pfaffikon Zug and Nyon Until Rainer-Marc Frey 39 a former Salomon bond trader sold his RMF fund management business to the UK's Man Group for $833m £571m last month few outside the global hedge fund industry had heard of RMF let alone Pfaffikon a small town on Lake Zurich where Frey had assembled one of Europe's biggest fund of hedge fund operations The price paid for a business with $8 5bn of funds under management looks steep when compared with the $750m that Swiss Bank Corporation paid for Gary Brinson's $35bn traditional US fund management business or UBS's $675m acquisition of the late Gilbert de Botton's $13 9bn GAM fund management empire But RMF which has been doubling its funds under management for the past six years has been much more profitable and faster-growing than traditional fund management rivals It is one of the best known of a group of Swiss fund managers ranging from private banks such as Geneva's UBP to alternative investment boutiques such as Nyon's EIM which have sprung up to balance the explosion in Swiss demand for hedge funds with a limited supply of top hedge fund managers Switzerland is the capital of the offshore private banking industry with an estimated 30 per cent of internationally invested private assets worldwide under management Its clientele principally rich individuals have been driving global demand for hedge funds which is why Switzerland is number two in the hedge fund business after the US As pension funds diversify into hedge funds competition for access to quality managers is intensifying The disparity in performance among hedge funds is substantially larger than traditional funds so the difference and therefore risk between winners and losers is enormous says James Breiding managing director of Naissance an alternative investment manager Pascal Botteron author of a recent report on Swiss hedge fund investing by Arthur Andersen the financial consultancy says Swiss banks and financial intermediaries account for $100bn-$130bn of the world's $500bn hedge fund industry According to the Swiss National Bank profits of Switzerland's 369 banks fell 36 per cent last year and funds under management the life-blood of most Swiss banks dropped 8 5 per cent to SFr3400bn Hence Swiss private banks have been scrambling to offer clients access to hedge funds the one part of the industry enjoying double digit growth rates The Andersen study showed that the number of visits made by private banks to hedge fund operators rose by 52 per cent last year Mr Frey says the hedge fund industry can grow by at least 25 per cent a year over the next decade If hedge funds represent 2 per cent of global liquid assets raising the penetration rate to 8-9 per cent makes this a fascinating business he says The ability of Credit Suisse Private Banking CSPB to boost its funds under management by 2 8 per cent last year as rival Julius Baer suffered a 11 per cent drop had a lot to do with CSPB's aggressive push to offer hedge fund products to its private banking clients The fact that CSPB Switzerland's second largest private bank felt it worthwhile to outsource its hedge fund business to RMF says a lot about the industry RMF does not manage hedge funds itself It manages the hedge fund managers promising clients a bespoke investment exposure to alternative assets through specialised products With their mystique of low volatility lack of correlation to traditional asset classes and high returns hedge funds have become the darling of today's investors Mr Botteron says But many of the best hedge fund managers refuse to take on more money from new investors who are forced to turn to untested hedge fund managers In an unregulated market with little transparency there is a premium on financial specialists that can guarantee a stringent and effective selection process for new hedge fund managers As pension funds become more interested in hedge funds the selection process will become even more important says Philipp Hildebrand head of UBP alternative investment Switzerland's growing expertise in this makes it well-placed to capitalise on the latest love affair with hedge funds Investing in Hedge Funds Available at www arthurandersen ch,2
2002-06-03, City economists expect the Bank of England's monetary policy committee this week to leave interest rates unchanged at their lowest levels in more than a generation But most analysts think the cost of borrowing is set to rise soon after The MPC is likely to be goaded into raising its benchmark rate above 4 per cent over the coming months by the continuing rise in house prices and families' persistent willingness to take on debt to finance their shopping and homebuying Borrowers have reason to thank disappointing official numbers that suggest the economy stopped growing for six months at the end of last year and the beginning of this year Domestic demand continued to grow but exports kept falling depressing the manufacturing sector further The official data pose a dilemma for the committee which ends its monthly rate-setting meeting on Thursday Recent surveys suggest that economic growth has returned with a vengeance in the current quarter BDO Stoy Hayward's latest poll of polls a weighted average of recent business surveys points to healthy growth in the second half of the year But the MPC may be reluctant to raise the cost of borrowing reining in future economic growth until the government's statisticians have confirmed that the economy is growing MPC members are likely to be even more sensitive to accusations that they err on the side of hawkishness when setting rates following recent criticism by Sushil Wadhwani the arch-dove who retired from the committee on Friday Mr Wadhwani told the Financial Times last week that the Bank's independence could be at risk if it continued to undershoot its target for inflation Underlying inflation has been below the government's 2 5 per cent target for 35 of the past 37 months Many analysts expect the MPC to raise rates in early July as it becomes increasingly evident that the world economy is recovering and pulling Britain along with it  Digby Jones director-general of the Confederation of British Industry yesterday outlined alternatives to the increase in national insurance contributions outlined in the Budget and criticised by business leaders as a tax on jobs In an interview with BBC radio's Westminster Hour Mr Jones suggested that instead value-added tax or corporation tax could have been raised A government committed to full employment showed a fundamental ignorance of the business equation in the way they raised money he said ,3
2002-06-13, Japan's central bank left its monetary policy unchanged as expected on Wednesday hemmed in by deflationary pressures and shaky economic growth The Bank of Japan decided in its bi-monthly policy meeting to maintain its monetary stance and zero interest rate policy despite recent signs of economic recovery including a return to economic growth in the January to March quarter after three quarters of recession The nine-member BoJ board voted unanimously to keep its current account reserve for banks between Y10000bn £55bn $80bn {XEU}85bn and Y15000bn and its purchases of government bonds at Y1000bn per month in its efforts to maintain banking liquidity The central bank said it would depart from its guidelines however in the case of unforeseen market fluctuations Should there be a risk of financial market instability such as a surge in liquidity demand the bank will provide more liquidity irrespective of the guideline above the BoJ said In recent weeks the central bank at the behest of the government has intervened in the foreign exchange market to stave off a strengthening yen that threatens Japan's export-led recovery Most economists expect no change in the central bank's position through to the end of 2002 and only after the economy stabilises and prices have stopped falling Japan's economy grew by an annualised 5 7 per cent from January to March on the strength of growing exports and April machinery orders were unexpectedly strong But the optimism is tempered by deflationary pressure a yen that continues to test the dollar uncertain demand from the US Japan's largest trading partner and falling domestic demand The BoJ has been very cautious with policy changes after it was blamed by the government for pushing Japan's economy off its peak in August 2000 by tightening monetary policy With the recent spate of positive economic data the government has declared the economy at a turning point something the BoJ has not done ,2
2002-06-10, Woori in the space of little more than a year appears to be firmly on its way to a textbook restructuring The South Korean government-owned banking group's balance sheet has been cleaned up professional management is in place it has successfully tapped the domestic market for Won612bn $504m and has lured a $1bn investment from Lehman the US investment bank But some analysts are concerned that the sheer speed and scope of the restructuring which envisages the government bowing out entirely by 2005 and joint ventures in financial services from credit cards to insurance suggests the Woori success story could yet end in tears It could also be hobbled by structural issues the government has failed to tackle in its sweep of economic reforms the most important being the tough laws designed to protect labour It is noteable that Woori which holds four commercial nationalised banks plus one merchant bank and boasts assets of $80bn has yet to achieve synergies on the scale of mergers in other parts of the world After the International Monetary Fund bailed out South Korea following the crisis in 1997 42 per cent of the subsidiary banks' employees were laid off But since they came together under the Woori umbrella rationalisation has tailed off Woori says it may relocate some old branches and sees no need for any lay-offs although should that change redundancies would be considered it says Analysts who reckon there is scope for far more aggressive pruning reckons Woori's hands will prove tied by the tight labour laws and that the government doubly sensitive in an election year will avoid lay- offs Euoo Sung Min vice-chairman and chief financial officer has concentrated on ridding the banks of their bad loans and is now firmly focused on returns and creating a financial powerhouse He aims to reduce reliance on corporate banking in favour of the more lucrative areas of credit cards investment banking and insurance By 2005 he forecasts non-banking revenues will account for half of all revenues The business sectors with the highest return on equity have been retail banking at around 40 per cent and credit cards at more than 30 per cent he says Other juicy returns that have attracted his attention are those to be gleaned in investment banking where Korea's restructuring is throwing up lucrative mandates He wants to emulate the Nikko Salomon Smith Barney model in Japan where an international investment bank has married its distribution and marketing muscle to a strong Japanese franchise and client relationships and is already in discussions with a couple of global houses But other investment bankers reckon it is an unattractive proposition as any investment bank tying itself to Woori would likely close the door to mandates from other financial institutions in Korea This is the area expected to yield most business in the coming years We've seen it with Goldman Sachs and Kookmin Bank in which the US investment bank has an effective 9 5 per cent stake which it is now seeking to cut to 6 25 per cent Everyone else is saying 'Why do you want to give the mandate to Goldman Because they're involved with Kookmin' says one Woori's other ambitions include finding partners for an insurance and an asset management joint venture Morgan Stanley is conducting the hunt at the same time as listing overseas and continuing to clean up its balance sheet Some suggest all this is too much and will result in communication breakdown as directors head off in different directions Top management may be professional bankers says one investment banker but they are not practical strategists As for plans to buy a securities house Woori is eyeing Daewoo Securities over which it could get into a bidding war with Hana Bank this will simply bring it into an industry ripe for consolidation where margins are rapidly deteriorating according to one rival banker The report card is kinder on efforts to return its constituent banks to health Woori has aggressively sought to reduce its non-performing loans They now account for 4 5 per cent of total loans including Hynix down from 16 3 per cent in 2000 It claims to be the most conservatively provisioned bank in Korea and by September expects to meet the more stringent Gaap accounting standards of the US It plans to further whittle down bad loans through an equally owned joint venture with Lehman Brothers Mr Min says the delay in securing final agreement with Lehman on this deal a binding letter of intent was signed last April simply reflects time taken to ensure the vehicle is completely ring-fenced from Woori's consolidated balance sheet We don't think that's a deal breaker so within a month we will have a closing he says Mr Min reckons the bad loans held in the venture which have a face value of Won16000bn will fetch around Won2000bn Further bids to privatise Woori include selling a block of around 20 per cent of the company to a strategic investor envisaged as a consortium led by a domestic industrial group ,1
2002-06-07, The purchase of Sidex the giant state-owned steel mill at Galati in eastern Romania by LNM Ispat a British registered company caused a political scandal in Britain There were allegations that Tony Blair the prime minister had intervened to support LNM's offer because Lakshmi Mittal LNM's chairman and chief executive had donated to the Labour party Media coverage focused on the alleged political manoeuvres that led Mr Mittal to acquire 92 per cent of the company but few reports looked at the business logic behind the deal By many yardsticks the $60m £41m purchase price and a commitment to invest $351m over 10 years of which $251m was due in the first five years seemed risky The Galati mill is a sprawling site in one of the poorest regions of Europe and was losing about $1m a day The company had debts of about $160m and virtually no cash flow because almost all sales were conducted by barter The Romanian authorities have a reputation for not being particularly investor-friendly and insisted there could be no redundancies for five years before they would allow the plant to be sold The mill was hugely overstaffed with 27000 workers Meanwhile the global steel industry was floundering with bankruptcies and protective tariffs and few companies making a profit On top of those problems Sidex was the biggest employer in Romania and was responsible for about 6 per cent of the country's gross domestic product Narendra Chaudhary director of newly named Ispat Sidex was immediately aware of the company's significance There was a huge concern about Sidex's future and about the change he says Sidex was very important to the whole economy There were 27000 direct jobs with 100000-150000 dependent on the plant  Nevertheless there has been fast progress since the deal Declining sales in the domestic market have been reversed When LNM arrived in November 2001 the company was selling 80000 tonnes in Romania half of which were seconds In March 2002 domestic sales peaked at almost 110000 tonnes The increase is all the more impressive because it came after the company adopted a policy of refusing to sell seconds substandard products on the domestic market Satyakam Basu director of marketing says there were substantial sales of seconds at unusually high prices I thought 'he's not in love with me so why is he giving me such a high price for seconds' says Mr Basu The new management believed employees were receiving kickbacks from buyers to label prime steel falsely as seconds It didn't take a genius to work out what was going on So to stop it we just banned all sales of seconds in the country says Mr Basu The result was a huge increase in sales of the more profitable prime steel Unusual sales patterns were not the only anomalies that the 25-strong management team noticed when they arrived The company is the only significant employer in Galati and was making huge losses Yet the area was filled with dollar millionaires and an unusual number of expensive cars Sidex was losing money because most of the business being done was not in the best interests of the company says Mr Chaudhary Much of the money was being siphoned away through trading companies which sold steel to the domestic market They never paid cash but bought the steel by barter This bartering supplied Sidex with everything from the raw materials to make the steel to coffee hospital supplies and stationery One of the first actions of the new management was to end all barter transactions and all deals with the trading companies unless they had an end user identified in advance The move came as a shock to the local business people who had become wealthy from cosy relationships with the old management We had some phone calls Some were friendly and arm-twisting others were less friendly and threatened to break my fingers says one member of the new management team According to Mr Basu the trading companies were slowly suffocating the company Traders were getting the steel and then competing with each other for sales driving the price down he says I realised my biggest competitor was myself Now the trader has to give me the name of the end user or I won't sell to him Because of the corruption everyone was making money except Sidex We decided to get rid of this cancer even if it meant we lost money in the short term  Within the factory most of the workers welcomed the new managers particularly as they paid the wages on time Before privatisation salaries could be up to two months late Workers were also mollified by the no redundancies clause Besides stemming the obvious losses the new management has had to change ingrained mentalities that were ill-suited to a market economy Under state ownership there was no concept of working with the customers to answer their needs The lack of customer care was a leftover from the Communist system says Mr Chaudhary In the Communist system they were responsible only for production and raw materials Where the products went was dictated by Bucharest We tried to understand the requirements of customers Over the first 30 days we went off in the four different directions meeting each and every customer and documented their individual requirements to try to offer what they wanted  Previously there had been no contact with the customers all sales were done through traders According to Mr Basu this contact started almost immediately and surprised some I arrived on October 4 and on October 6 I visited my first customer he says He was buying 200000 tonnes a year and he said it was the first time he had seen someone from Sidex in 23 years  LNM has performed similar turnrounds at companies in Trinidad Tobago Mexico and most recently in Kazakhstan fine-tuning the process as it goes along What has happened in six months at Ispat Sidex took two years in Kazakhstan says Mr Chaudhary The company also uses its global network to reduce costs We have a conference call one day a week with 30 or 40 managers from across the world with most importantly a very organised agenda says Mr Mittal Mr Mittal says this pooling of international experience is used to drive down costs My father used to say steel-making was an art Now I say steel-making is a science  He believes this scientific view makes it easier for the company to break long-established and sometimes inefficient practices The steel industry is very traditional and people don't like to break tradition he adds Mr Mittal expects Sidex to come into profitability next year But he is satisfied his

2002-06-14, Dairy Crest is to spend£49m expanding Davidstow creamery in North Cornwall which makes Cathedral City and Davidstow mature cheddar cheese The investment its biggest ever in a single site will increase capacity by two-thirds over the next 10 years It is being partly funded by an £8m government grant The two brands have increased their share of the market significantly in recent years and according to Ian Laurie finance director the creamery is creaking at the seams trying to keep production up with demand The expansion will increase capacity from 33000 to 55000 tonnes In the latest financial year to March 31 sales volumes of Cathedral City rose 18 per cent in a market segment that fell by 2 per cent Even so branded mature cheddars only have about 20 per cent of the market with retailers' labels making up the rest Drummond Hall who is taking over from John Houliston as chief executive next month said We still think there is considerable upside for brands  Mature cheddar which has been aged for a year or more commands prices between two and three times those for mild cheddar which is matured for only a few months Dairy Crest's stocks of maturing cheese are worth £170m The news accompanied results for the latest 12 months that showed profits up from £57m to £73 7m before exceptional charges At the pre-tax level the figure fell from £33 6m to £28 9m Turnover rose from £1 31bn to £1 37bn The group is continuing to benefit from the acquisition of the Unigate milk and cheese business in 2000 with merger savings of £11m achieved but at the cost of operating exceptional charges of £41 6m £21 5m Savings are on track to reach £25m in the current year Mr Houliston said the group's brands which also include Clover spreads and Frijj flavoured milk all produced double-digit volume growth Higher profits from added-value businesses were somewhat diluted by lower returns from the doorstep milk business and dairy ingredients where high raw milk prices could not be recouped when commodity prices fell Mr Houliston said that with the benefits from the Unigate deal coming through progressively results this year would be weighted to the second half Earnings per share were 18p 20 2p and a final dividend of 10 4p 9 6p gives a total of 15 2p 14 1p Comment  The shares which have performed strongly of late slipped 35p to 511{1/2}p yesterday on a mixture of profit taking and the cautious note on the first half Even so profits before tax and exceptionals are due to rise to £85m for the year another 15 per cent increase adding to the group's record of 15 per cent compound earnings growth since it floated in 1996 Given the state of the dairy industry for many of the intervening years that is not bad going and as the company remarked yesterday it does show the benefit of having a broad base of products With a forward p/e of under 10 5 and a 3 per cent and rising yield the shares are still attractive for investors who value reliability over excitement ,2
2002-06-25, Arcelor Arcelor's first set of results makes gloomy reading The merger of the French Spanish and Luxembourg steelmakers coincided with a 20-year trough in steel prices and a US clampdown on imports But the outlook is starting to improve The company is forecasting a return to net profit in the second quarter after a first quarter loss of {XEU}24m Customers are rebuilding stocks and two price rises have been made to stick The current valuation is not demanding Arcelor is trading on an enterprise value of 3 4 times prospective 2003 earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation compared with the sector average of four But the company has a lot to do Guy Dolle chief executive still has to implement the restructuring programme News of a possible deal with Bethlehem Steel in the US prompted fears management could be distracted from the main task Despite its size Arcelor remains hostage to an industry not known for its supply discipline and with at least 100m tonnes of overcapacity Meanwhile the firmer euro is increasing European producers' costs and making Europe a more attractive market for imports Even if everything goes well time is short The pace of the steel cycle has been speeding up A peak in mid-2003 suggests share prices which typically anticipate the event by three to six months will peak around the turn of the year With prospects for the fourth quarter unlikely to be clear before September that leaves investors a narrow window of opportunity ,2
2002-06-21, Scotland bucked the UK trend last year enjoying a record-breaking year for private equity with a total of £440m invested in 122 companies That represented a very perky rise of 68 per cent in investment volumes on 2000 compared with a more dismal 26 per cent fall in private equity investments for the UK as a whole But that impressive leap in volumes is not necessarily the best measure of what may prove something of a landmark year for venture capital in Scotland one which underlined the country's rising international status both as a source and recipient of venture capital finance At least as significant as the scale of activity was the recognition accorded Scotland by the arrival last December of the European Tech Tour Association This brought 55 high-profile venture capitalists from across Europe the US and east Asia to Edinburgh and Glasgow to meet 20 of Scotland's emerging technology companies The visit was the first to the UK by the four-year-old association following tours to Italy Germany Switzerland France Spain Ireland and Finland On one level the arrival of such an elite crop of venture capital professionals to Scotland was a measure of the recent energy in the country's technology sector notably in optical electronics digital media and communications technology More significant for Scotland however was the fact that the tour promises to open the country's technology companies to a wider global finance network Scotland has long had one of the UK's most thriving internal networks of venture capitalists and business angels indeed LINC the Glasgow- based organisation that acts as a business angel brokerage has become a European model What has been lacking according to David Sibbald one of Scotland's most successful technology entrepreneurs and a host for the tour have been wider links outside the country It's one of these things that generally Scotland is not great at says Mr Sibbald who chairs two early-stage technology companies and earlier created a third Atlantech which he sold on to Cisco Systems for £180m What we need to learn and what the tech tour is promising to provide is our ability to create networks use and develop them year-in year-out It takes time and a lot of work and you don't see the benefits immediately But five months after the tech tour we're still seeing its effects in continuing contacts  Opening US and European doors to promising Scottish technology has been pushed to the centre of the country's overall economic strategy In the three years since devolution both the Scottish executive and Scottish Enterprise the country's development agency have aligned policy initiatives behind improving commercialisation of Scottish university science research and a drive to breed home-grown technology companies In areas such as life sciences digital media communications software and optical electronics Scotland has already produced a raft of small but potentially global companies in the past few years The list includes Strakan the speciality pharmaceuticals company Cyclacel which is developing cancer treatments Digital Bridges the games company and a raft of optical components companies such as Intense Photonics Kamelian and TeraHertz Photonics But there is widespread agreement within Scotland shared by investors entrepreneurs and policymakers that the country needs to do more to foster its promising science base Robert Crawford chief executive of Scottish Enterprise points out that Scotland lags comparable-sized European nations in its levels of research and development and commercialisation Accordingly the development agency this year unveiled plans to create a £20m fund of funds to provide further seed finance to the earliest-stage technology companies Mr Crawford has also pioneered plans to create a series of intermediate technology institutes backed by up to £100m over five years and designed to commission exploitable research from Scottish universities in life science energy and communications technologies Meanwhile the Scottish executive has re-aligned its industrial grants policy to change the balance of funding from attracting big overseas investors and in favour of smaller technology companies It has also introduced proof of concept grants and fellowships to back commercially-minded academics at the very earliest stages of company formation Few corners of Europe now offer so wide a range of policy initiatives and instruments to support start-up technology companies in general and the lab-to-product company formation and commercialisation in particular And there are promising signs of a gathering momentum from such initiatives Last month Charles Irving founder partner of Pond Venture partners said he would be concentrating more resources on looking at Scottish high-tech start-ups There's been much written in the press over the past few months about Scotland being a hot-bed of technological development and I have to concur he said Moreover Kevin Lyon head of 3i in Scotland believes Scottish universities are showing clear signs of improving their commitment to commercialisation He reels off a list of recent spin-out companies such as Kymata MicroEmissive Displays Kamelian Intense Photonics Five years ago I'd have been struggling to think of any he says ,2
2002-06-04, The credit markets are signalling concern over the creditworthiness of Farmer Mac a US corporation created by Congress to help bolster the farm loan market  Bids on default swaps for Farmer Mac have risen sharply over the past month from 60 basis points to around 200bp although traders said yesterday that at such levels it was not clear if there any transactions were now taking place The increase reflects investor concern over rising loan deliquencies and the agency's financial disclosure Farmer Mac is the largest issuer of unrated debt in the US according to Moody's Investors Service It had more than $3 2bn in debt at the end of the first quarter with some $2 3bn coming due within one year Farmer Mac's stock has also fallen sharply losing more than half its value since January to $29 80 per share The agency has attributed the fall to short-sellers and asked the New York Stock Exchange to investigate trading activity It says there have been no changes in its business condition Farmer Mac is and will remain fiscally safe and sound said CEO Henry Edelman in a conference call on Friday adding that the agency sees no reason to get a debt rating Analysts say any problems at Farmer Mac could have implications for the other government agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac There is a very low probability that the US government would allow Farmer Mac to fail said Alec Crawford head of mortgage-backed research at Deutsche Bank But there would be some psychological risk to the other agencies should a failure ever occur he added ,2

2002-04-16, France Telecom is poised to take back the stake in Noos the French cable company that it sold to NTL a year ago NTL borrowed $625m to buy 27 per cent of Noos from the French telecommunications company and used the Noos stake as collateral for the loan About $500m of that borrowing falls due next month and NTL is not expected to make the payment As a result France Telecom plans to take back ownership of the Noos stake An agreement is expected to be reached as part of NTL's overall debt restructuring France Telecom has written down to zero its 18 3 per cent investment in NTL and cut the value of the NTL preference shares it owns some of which it received in exchange for Noos An investment vehicle of Morgan Stanley bought 22 9 per cent of Noos the balance of France Telecom's investment in the company Juliana Ratner London,1
2002-04-09, Merrill Lynch the world's biggest broker yesterday came under fire from US prosecutors for allegedly issuing misleading stock recommendations during the technology boom of the late 1990s The New York State Attorney General said it had a sought court order to force Merrill to disclose alleged conflicts of interest between its research analysts and investment bankers Yesterday Merrill declined to comment Eliot Spitzer New York State Attorney General said the bank's analysts issued biased misleading stock picks in an attempt to secure lucrative contracts for investment banking services This was a shocking betrayal of trust by one of Wall Street's most trusted names Mr Spitzer said The case must be a catalyst for reform throughout the entire industry  The move comes despite attempts by investment banks to respond to criticism by imposing restrictions on analysts dealings in the stocks they cover The Attorney General released a number of internal e-mails sent by Merrill Lynch staff which it said raised concerns about conflicts of interest The e-mails indicate that analysts privately disparaged companies while publicly recommending their stocks One such e-mail from October 9 2000 read I think we are off base on how we rate stocks and how much bend backwards to to accommodate banking etc Breaking the link between writing and rating is a partial solution but I think the issue is much deeper  Another suggested that the firm was putting the interests of big corporate clients ahead of its retail investors We are losing money and I don't like it john and mary are losing their retirement because we don't want todd to be mad at us  Merrill along with other Wall Street banks has been criticised after analysts including former technology analyst Henry Blodget trumpeted dotcom stocks that later collapsed Wall Street analysts have been in the spotlight since the internet bubble burst and the recent collapse of Enron has increased the intensity of investors' and lawmakers' scrutiny Last month analysts were quizzed in Congressional hearings about why they continued to recommend Enron stock even as it plunged towards bankruptcy www ft com/financialservices,2
2002-04-06, Last year was the quietest for mergers and acquisitions in the watch and jewellery industries for more than a decade Consolidation is now the name of the game as staunch independents such as Audemars Piguet Herme`s Patek Philippe and Rolex continue to ignore the flourishings of corporate cheque books These companies have no need of their contents because they are prospering mightily Once established in the right markets a successful wristwatch model can be extremely profitable A few of the big public groups are making the news LVMH is rarely out of it because Bernard Arnault is one of France's most visible businessmen Controlling 48 per cent of its capital and a majority of votes he heads the world's largest luxury products group which has announced total sales for 2001 of {XEU}12 2bn a 5 per cent gain on the previous year Group sales were down 4 per cent during the fourth quarter in the aftermath of September 11 LVMH markets the following watch brands Chaumet Christian Dior DKNY Ebel Favre Leuba Fendi it owns a 51 per cent share Fred Givenchy TAG Heuer and Zenith Last year the watch and jewellery divisions produced sales of {XEU}539m down 12 per cent on 2000 yielding an operating income of {XEU}27m A key brand in the group is the highly profitable Louis Vuitton which provided 80 per cent of last year's operating profits and this year will see the launch of a Louis Vuitton watch range It is also expected that LVMH will use its recently-acquired online retailer eLuxury com to increase both watch and jewellery sales The group with the widest spread of brands in terms of markets is the Swatch Group Its brand names include Blancpain Breguet Calvin Klein Certina Endura own label Flik Flak a children's label Glashutte Hamilton Jaquet-Droz Le`on Hatot Longines Mido Omega Pierre Balmain Rado Swatch and Tissot Turnover for the group in 2001 was down 1 9 per cent at SFr4182m while net income dropped 7 7 per cent to SFr504m Turnover in the fourth quarter was down sharply an experience common to all watch groups Pinault Printemps-Redoute has controlled 53 2 per cent of the quoted Gucci Group since last September and holds options to increase its stake Domenico De Sole Gucci's chief executive officer has expansionist plans for his watch brands These include Balenciaga of which Gucci owns 91 per cent Bedat 85 per cent owned Boucheron Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci itself The Gucci Group's net profit in 2001 dropped 1 9 per cent to {XEU}753m on sales 12 3 per cent higher than the previous year at {XEU}27 8bn Serge Weinberg the group's chief executive recently admitted that 30 per cent of the group's subsidiaries were trading at less than acceptable profit levels Last year the quoted but family-controlled Italian jeweller Bulgari caused a surprise in the watch industry by purchasing Daniel Roth and Gerald Genta from the Singapore-based Hour Glass group Its own watch division has been on a growth path in recent years It has its own factory in Neuchatel and economies of scale are coming through The group's net revenue turnover increased 13 per cent to {XEU}766m in 2001 Sales rose in most geographic areas with the distinct exception of the US Middle East sales rose by a healthy 58 per cent However watch sales showed a decrease of 6 per cent and the last quarter of 2001 registered a fall of 27 per cent from the previous year Francesco Trapani chief executive of Bulgari attributes this figure to nervous destocking by retailers following the events of September 11 However he expects a big improvement in the watch division this year Bulgari chooses not to exhibit at either the annual World Watch and Jewellery Show in Basle or at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie that immediately follows it preferring to stage its own trade show in Geneva This year it will be adding the Rubber Chrono model to its successful Rettangolo range of watches This piece has a large 49 mm stainless steel case Bulgari states that this watch is designed for men and women who have a penchant for a sporty metropolitan look and it is mounted on a casual yet elegant rubber bracelet with stainless steel links and deployante clasp buckle The tragic early death of Gunter Blumlein last October caused the Richemont group to restructure its top management Mr Blumlein is succeeded as head of the watchmaking division by Henry-John Belmont who was previously head of Jaeger-LeCoultre Richemont acquired 90 per cent of A Lange & Sohne in 2000 and it is now in the hands of Bruno Dellenbach a former finance director at LVMH Richemont reported stable trading in the last quarter of 2001 and stated that when the A Lange & Sohne IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre brands are excluded from the figures all of which it acquired in December 2000 sales declined by 8 per cent Another example of the September 11 factor is the company's US sales Richemont's sales there fell 42 per cent from the same period a year previously Pierre Tissot a leading industry analyst at Lombard Odier is not alone in detecting a certain lack of transparency in published reports of Richemont's brands' performances Nevertheless the group appears very well placed to capitalise on the continuing growth in luxury watch sales timepieces account for 45 per cent of group sales and perhaps more importantly to benefit from branding in the highly fragmented jewellery sector Another of this sector's mainstays Alfred Dunhill now branded as Dunhill was not profitable in the last fiscal year and the company says it will take two or three more years to achieve a realistic turnaround in profitability Cartier headed by Guy Leymarie stands alone as a separate enterprise in the Richemont stable and is the most profitable brand in the group In fiscal 2001 Cartier accounted for about 66 per cent of group sales Analysts at JP Morgan estimate that 48 per cent of this figure came from its watch sales About 400000 pieces were produced last year according to Mr Tissot Richemont's sales in fiscal 2002 are predicted to reach {XEU}3875m Piaget's new factory outside Geneva opened in June 2001 and is expected to produce about 20000 units this year This long-established watch and jewellery subsidiary will soon be opening new stores in Geneva New York Paris and Vienna Richemont also controls 80 per cent of Van Cleef & Arpels which equity analysts at JP Morgan Securities forecast will be a key profit centre in a few years' time Watches contribute about 15 per cent to its total revenue figure and it is expected that this proportion will increase in the near future Van Cleef & Arpels' famous jewellery ranges will also benefit from Richemont's marketing expertise as will the perfume division which is to be relaunched this year These luxury products groups are now joined by Fossil a middle market watch brand conglomerate based in Dallas The young and energetic Tom Kartzotis is guiding the expanding fortunes of this public company and has accumulated an enticing portfolio of dial names including Burberry DKNY Emporio Armani Fossil itself often retailed in collectable tin boxes Harry Potter Philippe Starck and Zodiac The latter a recent acquisition is Mr Kartzotis' first step into the rarefied field of Swiss mechanical watchmaking This is a group to watch ,1

2002-06-07, The crisis in Germany's liberal Free Democratic party that put one of its leaders on a collision course with the country's Jewish community appeared to be resolved yesterday after Jurgen Mollemann the FDP's deputy chairman apologised for what were seen as anti-semitic remarks At the same time Jamal Karsli a politician in the party's North Rhine-Westphalia district which Mr Mollemann heads said he would step down Mr Karsli who had recently defected to the FDP from the Greens came under attack after separately accusing the Israeli government of adopting Nazi methods against Palestinians Mr Karsli had until yesterday been defended by Mr Mollemann The two steps resolved the main objections of Germany's Jewish leaders to settling a spiralling dispute which has hit the FDP just as its support was rising strongly The dispute has also called into question the authority of Guido Westerwelle its chairman Mr Westerwelle's hesitation in disciplining his deputy prompted speculation that Mr Mollemann's apparent appeal to far-right voters might have been part of a tacit agreement to broaden the FDP's base The action by Mr Mollemann a renowned maverick backfired after attacks from senior FDP figures including Otto Graf Lambsdorff and Hans-Dietrich Genscher two former ministers Representatives of Germany's Jewish community this week demonstrated outside the FDP headquarters Meanwhile leaders of other parties attacked Mr Mollemann's remarks and Mr Westerwelle's apparent inability to rein in his wayward deputy Gerhard Schroder the chancellor and Joschka Fischer foreign minister and lead candidate for the Greens in September's general elections both warned this week that Mr Mollemann's tactics risked endangering Germany's international reputation Separately Edmund Stoiber lead candidate for the opposition Christian Democrats cautioned against the irresponsibility of playing with the fire of anti-semitism for campaign purposes although he conspicuously failed to add that the FDP's approach might endanger its chances of forming the next coalition government should he prove successful in September While fanned by electioneering the dispute also spotlighted the continuing sensitivities in Germany in discussing relations with Israel or members of the country's Jewish community The political furore coincided with a separate but now associated dispute over a novel as yet unpublished by Martin Walser one of Germany's leading writers The work which has provoked heated debate concerns the murder of a Jewish literary critic by an enraged author ,3
2002-06-04, Castorama yesterday claimed a victory in its tussle with Kingfisher over the UK retailer's {XEU}5bn £3 41bn bid for control of the French DIY group It welcomed the replacement of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney with Rothschild as the bank that will provide the fairness opinion on the value of Kingfisher's bid The French company said it hoped the change presided over by the Paris commercial court would put pressure on Kingfisher to raise its {XEU}67 a share bid for the 45 per cent of Castorama that it does not already own It had pursued the matter on behalf of the minority shareholders Castorama had objected to SSSB as the arbitrator of the bid's value Jean-Hughes Loyez chairman had said he was astonished to discover SSSB was financial adviser to Compass the UK catering group chaired by Francis Mackay who is also chairman of Kingfisher The Paris court said yesterday Without pronouncing on the independence of SSSB the two sides agreed to mandate Rothschild & Co  Kingfisher's advisers yesterday described Rothschild as a compromise bank seen as French in France and British in the City Rothschild has a month to evaluate Kingfisher's offer and will not take on any work for either side for a six-month period after the end of its mandate Kingfisher last week criticised Castorama's partners for using delaying tactics to frustrate the deal Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy chief executive yesterday said he was delighted the bid could move forward Under Article 21 of their 1998 accord Castorama and Kingfisher agreed to appoint an independent bank to assess the fairness of any takeover bid Its opinion can overrule objections from minority shareholders Mr Mulcahy said We are delighted that the Article 21 process is now progressing and look forward to the delivery of the bank's certificate of fairness within the next month  A SSSB adviser said the bank had never seen it as a conflict of interest to act for a different company in a different sector where the same directors are involved We never sought this work We were asked to do it by both parties and our prospective appointment was confirmed by the French commercial court  SSSB maintained that it was independent But if both parties choose to appoint another investment bank to carry out the work then we wish them every success the adviser added A French judge on Friday asked Castorama to suggest three other investment banks to provide a fairness opinion Rothschild was yesterday described by Kingfisher advisers as a compromise bank seen as French in France and British in the City Kingfisher holds its annual shareholder meeting on Friday when management will seek backing for its Castorama bid Castorama's shares closed 5 cents higher at {XEU}67 45 www ft com/retail,1
2002-06-14, For Kovosvit one of the Czech Republic's biggest machine tool companies the communist world's transition to capitalism posed an immense challenge write Peter Marsh and Robert Anderson  Before the collapse of the communist bloc in 1989 Kovosvit was a state-owned company whose main activity was making lathes and machining centres for export to the Soviet Union Managers at the Tabor-based company never even inquired what they were to be used for although they assumed the machines were going to armaments factories Each year Kovosvit fulfilled the government order with no questions asked But following privatisation in 1991 Kovosvit has had to get used to a world of competition Jiri Konupek Kovosvit's chairman says We have had to create a new way of doing business  It has not been an easy task Dozens of other companies in the machine tool industry make similar equipment With 1700 employees and expected sales this year of {XEU}60m £39m Kovosvit exports about 60 per cent of its production with 40 per cent of non-Czech sales going to Germany and a quarter to Russia Other important markets are Portugal the Netherlands Belgium Italy and the UK The company has created a sales and marketing department of 30 people and virtually from scratch an 80-strong research and development team One advantage for Kovosvit is that its machines are relatively cheap with its standard products selling for {XEU}60000-{XEU}120000 less than some machines of comparable quality from competitors That follows from the Czech engineering industry's relatively low labour costs while engineering skills in the country are considered fairly good During the early 1990s Kovosvit and other Czech machine tool companies benefited from intense interest from machine tool makers in other countries keen to buy parts for their own products They were interested in capitalising on the low labour costs in some cases 75 per cent less than in western Europe The contacts helped Kovosvit to adapt says Mr Konupek We learnt a lot about design and how to market our machines It was like going to school  Among the companies with which Kovosvit co-operated on parts production were 600 Group of the UK Gildemeister of Germany Italy's Graziano and Hurco of the US In some cases there was talk of starting up formal joint ventures on production However the discussions petered out mainly it seems because of the un-certain financial state of the Czech company After a period of unstable ownership by local investment funds Kovosvit was until 1999 controlled by ZPS another Czech machine tool builder before ZPS's insolvency led to its being taken over by a group of Swiss-based investment trusts According to Mr Konupek the company made money last year although it has large bank debts While its financial structure looks far from secure another factor putting off western machine tool groups from getting involved is Kovosvit's unusually high level of manufacturing integration It has large numbers of employees doing jobs such as making relatively un-sophisticated castings which in a western company would be outsourced The large investment in staff carrying out such activities reduces Kovosvit's ability to react to changes in demand and is almost certainly a drag on profit-ability Kovosvit's future does not look particularly rosy But at least Mr Konupek can argue that the company has made a start on the road to restructuring ,2
2002-06-12, After a rapid ascent and an equally fast descent Mexican investors find themselves almost back where they started the year In US dollar terms the IPC index returned an 18 per cent profit by early April But since then falls of 8 per cent in the peso and more recently 11 per cent in the IPC have erased those gains Last week US-dollar returns fell into negative territory for the year Both the rise and fall reflect Mexico's narrow ties to the US economy say analysts It has become very apparent that investors are using Mexico as an adjunct of the US dollar area says Geoffrey Dennis Latin American equity strategist for Salomon Smith Barney It was the strength of Mexico's convergence play its new investment-grade status single-digit interest rates and positioning for an imminent US recovery that drove stock and currency markets up says Carlos Asilis global emerging markets strategist at JP Morgan But the drying up of the pool of positive catalysts has worked against it recently he says The trigger was an easing of Mexico's monetary policy in April after exporters complained that the superpeso was making them uncompetitive Many foreign investors took this as a cue to take profits and the currency dropped 5 per cent The past two weeks have seen a second wave of selling in the local markets Following the US dollar's steady decline against the euro and yen the peso depreciated as far as 9 82 per dollar Likewise the IPC index suffered 12 declines in 14 sessions in sympathy with Wall Street up to last Thursday Since then it has stabilised hovering around the 6800 mark compared with the year high of 7574 Mr Dennis says that rather than reflecting fundamentals it is essentially a flows issue Better growth prospects in Asia have lured emerging markets investors away from the region he says In addition a re-weighting of the MSCI caused a rebalancing of portfolios from Latin America to South Africa says Mr Asilis The drop has mainly hit large-cap ADR stocks After falling between 10 and 25 per cent some large-cap stocks have reached compelling valuations says Francisco Rivero head of equity research at Santander Investment in Mexico City who last week issued aggressive buy recommendations on a number of blue chips Mr Asilis also likes valuations We're still very bullish on Mexico relative to the US or Latin America says Mr Asilis adding that the market trades at 11 5 times 2002 earnings But for those investors who are only interested in total return before jumping in with both feet I would wait to see where the dollar stabilises versus the euro and yen  Mr Dennis says that the usual channels for an economic recovery through the export sector is still working in our view But he notes that a further deterioration in the peso could lead to a spike in inflation higher interest rates and a reduction in consumer spending Like other analysts Mr Rivero expects central bank invention or increased demand to keep further peso depreciation minimal Still he agrees If the peso goes through ten that would change the scenario  Alexander Hanrath,2
2002-04-11, Small-cap stock investors have earned 23 per cent more than large-cap shareholders in the past two years Or they earned 47 per cent more The margin of victory all depends on which index you use The Standard & Poor's Small-Cap 600 significantly outperformed the Russell 2000 from January 2000 to the end of February this year according to a recent report from Goldman Sachs Although the S&P index lagged behind its competitor in some years 9 per cent lower in 1999 for example it has climbed 47 per cent higher than the Russell 2000 over the past eight years That is an extra return of 2 8 per cent per year on average The news will be of particular interest to investors now because many have rushed into small-caps which shrugged off the downturn even as the broader market plummetted In 2001 small-cap mutual funds attracted 97 per cent more money than large-cap offerings This year investment in small-caps is 20 per cent higher Small-cap performance tends to be strong as we exit recessions said Sandy Rattray the Goldman analyst who wrote the note Although recent gains have been modest compared with those that came after previous downturns we expect positive flows to continue in the second quarter of 2002 he said But the investors who choose index-tracking mutual funds or exchange- traded funds must pay attention to the differences between the S&P and Russell offerings There are a few possible reasons for performance gap Aside from the number of stocks indexed industry weighting is the most obvious disparity Both indices are less concentrated in technology stocks than they were in 1999 but the S&P 600 is still dominated by tech Meanwhile the Russell 2000's top sector is financials and has increased that weighting over the past five years even as S&P decreased its exposure The Russell index will be rebalanced at the end of June and Mr Rattray expects it to tilt away from financials and consumer discretionary stocks and toward the tech and healthcare sectors But even the new index would have underperformed the S&P 600 year-to-date he said That is because earnings yield exposure not industry weighting seems to be the primary factor driving the S&P 600 higher Profitable companies have generated better and more stable returns since 1994 Especially in the most recent two years the S&P's profitability has paid off validating the claim that the Russell 2000 index suffers from the automatic inclusion of loser companies dropping out of the Russell 1000 large-cap index Mr Rattray said Investors should not lose sight of which index they choose ,2
2002-06-29, The Footsie recovered yesterday but most attention was on the bloodbath of the past six months rather than the one-day rally There was an element of deja` vu about the statistics The Footsie ended the first half down 10 75 per cent the last time the UK's benchmark index performed so badly the World Cup was also in full swing and Brazil was also in the final However in 1994 it was being played in the US and Italy was facing the samba squad The only other time that the index performed worse during a six-month period was the second half of 1987 which encompassed the Crash and the hurricane At the end of a week which saw the latest blow to US corporate confidence created by a $3 8bn hole in the accounts of Worldcom the telecommunications group as well as worries of Middle East conflict and global terrorism there were even more sobering factors for equity investors to reflect upon Not only did the UK experience the biggest half-yearly fall for eight years but failing a strong recovery the index will have been down for three years in a row If that happens it will be the first time since 1962 too distant for all but the most obsessive World Cup memories although for those keen to know Brazil was the winner then as well With that in mind the bounce of 115 8 to 4656 4 was a relief but not necessarily a reason to celebrate Much of the gain was sparked by the surprise announcement from the Financial Services Authority that it was relaxing the resilience tests for UK life assurers The move eased pressure on them to be forced sellers of equities and triggered a jump in their share prices The very quick recovery suggested hedge funds may have been caught short and savagely squeezed Footsie's rise was reflected all down the line with the FTSE 250 and Techmark both higher The FTSE 100 futures contract for September ended the session at 4660 in line with its estimated fair value premium to the cash market of 3 5 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 50 shortly after London closed despite the latest accounting headache provided by Xerox of the US Those gains could be short-lived Next week's trading might be stifled by the Independence Day holiday in the US and few strategists expect a shift in rates after the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meeting Also the respected Coppock Indicator which is based on the theory that markets take 11-14 months to recover was pointing to further selling in the second half Its January buy signal came with the proviso that Footsie had to move above 4830 by the end of June Turnover by the 6pm cut-off was 2 7bn shares ,2
2002-06-14, While Ecuador like much of the world focuses its attention on the World Cup baseball offers a better analogy for the government's recent policy problems In the past six weeks the Andean nation has had three strikes in its privatisation series failing to sell majority shares in the electricity distribution sector a separate $130m concession to run Emelec the biggest electricity distributor and the private administration of Pacifictel one of two state telecommunications monopolies With a presidential election due in October time is running out for the administration of President Gustavo Noboa Three strikes and you're out may become the epitaph for his regime I'd have to admit there has been a degree of frustration because of our inability to concrete the final stages of these processes says Antonio Pere director of Conam the government council in charge of modernisation The body's other boss is Ricardo Noboa brother of the president which means there has been no lack of political support for the privatisation drive Nonetheless the project has been overwhelmed by dissent from opposition legislators some of them with interests in maint-aining comfortable existing business relationships and from labour unions Analysts said the government needs to work harder at convincing its public of the benefits of privatisation It was hoped one of three international bidders for Emelec Spain's Union Fenosa PeCom of Argentina and AES of the US would take over and prove the benefits of privatisation paving the way for future successes But none got involved The government has wasted time mapping out its plans without having the political consensus to back it up says a New York analyst The failed privatisation of the telecoms and electricity sector was no surprise But in terms of Ecuador's future efficiency and competitiveness it is essential  Privatisation would offer a valuable source of foreign income to Ecuador's dollarised regime while acting as an anti-corruption tool The International Monetary Fund from whom Ecuador is seeking a $240m standby loan accord has expressed its disappointment Conam says a regulatory and legislative framework that would not be subject to legal challenge is definitively in place and that Pacifictel and maybe Andinatel its highland equivalent and most likely some of the electricity distributors will be under private administration though still state-owned before December Analysts remain sceptical Mr Pere insists there have been other successes at Conam about which he feels great satisfaction Although the electricity sector is still in state hands Conam has cleaned up the balance sheets of the distribution and generation companies preparing the way for potential private ownership Other sectors including civil aviation have been put in order Last year an international consortium took over the Guayaquil drinking water concession This week Conam signed a deal with Spanish bank BBVA and Lufthansa Consulting to find a private investor to manage the airport at Guayaquil and eventually build a new one In Quito a consortium led by the Canadian-government is close to agreeing a similar deal albeit without Conam's aid to build a new airport A 25-year concession to run the national postal service is supposed to be signed in a couple of months Last week Conam representatives were in Hamburg on a roadshow to publicise the tender to run one of its big ports Conam is still to sign off on these projects The telecoms and electricity privatisation were far more advanced and failed to crystallise As in baseball Ecuador has all too often stayed in the game until the final innings only to strike out and go home a loser ,3
2002-06-14, The European Central Bank yesterday warned thateurozone inflation was likely to remain above its two per cent target ceiling for the rest of the year reinforcing market expectations of a rate increase in coming months In the bank's biannual staff projections ECB economists revised upwards their forecast for average eurozone inflation for 2002 to a range of 2 1-2 5 per cent from 1 1-2 1 per cent ECB staff also raised their inflation forecast for next year to between 1 3 and 2 5 per cent against a range of 0 9-2 1 per cent just six months ago Economists said the substantially revised projections confirmed the ECB's increasingly hawkish stance and raised the likelihood that the central bank would move to tighten monetary policy soon They are going to tighten that's for sure Whether they do it in July August or September remains to be seen said one Wim Duisenberg ECB president indicated last week that the bank had an upward bias by declining to use the standard phrase appropriate to describe the current level of interest rates The bank now seems to be at liberty to lift interest rates at any of its next meetings said Nigel Anderson of RBS Financial Markets The ECB which has held rates steady at 3 25 per cent since last November warned last week that the upward risks to price stability had increased It echoed the same line in the editorial of its June monthly bulletin which was published yesterday The outlook for price stability in the medium term remains less satisfactory than a few months ago the ECB said It is particularly important for monetary policy to remain vigilant with regard to the further evolution of the key factors determining the outlook for prices it added The timing of any rate increase is likely to depend on whether the euro sustains its recent rally against the dollar and on the strength of the eurozone's economic recovery On both counts the ECB remains uncertain It said persistent appreciation of the euro would help limit inflation but it was still too early to assess recent developments The ECB used the bulletin to highlight its continuing worries that the outcome of recent wage negotiations in some regions of the euro area is a cause for concern In a speech made yesterday in Vienna Mr Duisenberg said that low wage flexibility was an important factor behind the lack of price flexibility in the euro area ,3
2002-04-03, London's equity market greeted the return to work after the long Easter holiday and the first trading session of the second quarter with no more than a whimper yesterday in a clear demonstration of the fragility that has capped sentiment since the rally from the events of September 11 last year Not even a £3 5bn agreed cash bid for one of its constituents could rescue the flagging FTSE 100 index as investors and dealers registered their concerns with the impact on global markets of the continued escalation of the violence occurring in the Middle East Enterprise Oil sprinted well clear of the rest of the FTSE 100 stocks after Shell stunned the market with a £3 5bn cash bid seen as unlikely to draw a counter from ENI the Italian oil group which made an initial approach to the company in December At the finish of trading however the FTSE 100 languished with a 20 4 decline at 5251 4 having been as low as 5231 5 at one stage The Techmark 100 also gave ground slipping 3 98 to 1196 0 On the other hand there was strong support for many of the second and third ranking stocks where some of the construction oil and transport stocks were favoured The FTSE 250 advanced 22 6 to 6198 2 and the SmallCap 2 7 to 2551 1 It was a mixture of those Middle East fears plus some worrying corporate news emanating from the US and the increasingly widespread view that interest rates in the US UK and eurozone are poised to go higher later this year that pulled the rug from under the leading UK indices yesterday Wall Street's rather muted performance on Monday when European markets were closed for the Easter holiday was a reflection of a poor showing from retail stocks And there was no respite for Wall Street yesterday when the Dow posted a near three-figure decline not long before London trading ceased for the day responding to profit warnings issued by two software companies PeopleSoft and BroadVision Economic data in the form of weaker-than-expected factory orders in February added to the bearish mood There was plenty of economic news and data released on both sides of the Atlantic at the start of a week which brings interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England's monetary policy committee Both announce their decisions on Thursday the MPC at midday and the ECB shortly afterwards Both are expected to leave rates on hold for the time being On the domestic front consumer credit in February was slightly above expectations while the purchasing managers' index rose to 50 7 in March compared with a consensus forecast of 50 9 Meanwhile the Confederation of British Industry's March survey of Distributive Trades showed a slight slowdown in the pace of high street sales over the month Turnover in equities just topped the 2bn mark ,2
2002-04-25, An impressive display by the banks and solid performances by many of the old economy sectors such as food manufacturing utilities and tobaccos came to the rescue of London's equity market yesterday writes Steve Thompson UK Stock Market Editor So did GlaxoSmithKline whose shares raced higher in the wake of warmly received first-quarter numbers But the new economy areas and particularly the telecoms had to endure another difficult session with Vodafone widely viewed as the villain of the piece in the FTSE 100's decline in the past couple of weeks only just managing to stave off another decline ahead of today's crucial trading update The oil majors one of the key sectors in the FTSE 100 because of their heavy weightings in the index were also under intense pressure after crude oil prices gave ground in the wake of US inventory news Dealers were not overly impressed with the market's performance however with some pointing out the potential for weakness from various areas including the Middle East situation and the continuing US first-quarter reporting season that still has some way to go There is still plenty of downside firepower left in this market and if Vodafone disappoints there could be plenty of pain for the market said one marketmaker He was surprised at the pace and power of the banks' advance which was spearheaded by Barclays HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland but which encompassed the whole sector The sector's surge came in the wake of several buy recommendations and ahead of annual meetings being held today by Barclays and Abbey National The former is expected to deliver a positive message to its shareholders and have its scrip issue proposal rubber stamped Fuelled by the gains in the banks and other defensive areas plus a decent rally in US markets the FTSE 100 index moved back above the 5200 level to finish a net 27 2 ahead at 5218 2 At its best the index was up 34 3 while at its worst only minutes after the start of the trading session it was down 22 0 at 5169 0 The other main indices were mixed The FTSE 250 was bolstered by the excellent performance of Egg the internet banking group whose shares topped the 250 winners list climbing 9 per cent after strong first-quarter figures Another boost for the midcap index came from the upsurge in shares in the London Stock Exchange which hit a record high amid takeover speculation The FTSE SmallCap was always in the red eventually closing a net 3 3 off at 2602 6 having been as low as 2599 4 The Techmark 100 fell 7 74 to 1103 33 its lowest closing level since hitting a record closing low of 1064 98 on September 21 in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on New York on September 11 Turnover reached 2 5bn shares Barclays boosts sector Barclays led the banking sector with a surprise 144p leap to £24 44 as the market decided that the sector was the only game in town If you want to play the UK there are four sectors banks oils drugs and telecoms and banks are the only area where there is a sense of security said one dealer Oils have been hit by disappointing numbers from ExxonMobil in the US while drugs stocks have been affected by poor figures from Bristol Myers Squibb and concerns about patent expiries Telecom stocks have been hit by practically everything With banks now offering a quarter of the UK market's dividend income and fears about bad debts receding the sector has increasingly become the only valid choice for cash-rich institutional investors Barclays was followed higher by HBOS which gained 4 per cent at 827{1/2}p and Royal Bank of Scotland up 76 at £20 01 Meanwhile the oil majors recorded double-digit falls as the release of some bearish US inventory data led to weaker crude prices and compounded the negative impact of ExxonMobil's results The American Petroleum Institute weekly report revealed a smaller-than- expected fall in crude oil stocks causing Brent to fall Also Credit Suisse First Boston cut its first-quarter earnings estimates for BP and Royal Dutch/Shell by 20 per cent and 25 per cent BP dropped 10{1/2} to 577{1/2}p and Shell Transport 12{1/2} to 488p In drugs the main players moved higher after some encouraging figures from GlaxoSmithKline The company's first-quarter figures came out slightly above consensus forecasts with earnings per share of 19p against expectations that they would be 18 7p GSK closed 35 higher at £16 73 AstraZeneca rose 56 to £35 27 helped by news that it had won a patent case in Canada Celltech improved 10{1/2} to 630p in response to news of a co-development and marketing deal with Biogen the US biotech company Analysts said the deal reduced the technical risk attached to the development of Celltech's treatment for Crohn's disease Whitbread was weak in early dealings and ended the session only 1p higher at 689{1/2}p after West LB Panmure reiterated its underperform stance saying the current share price provides an opportunity to take profits Encouraging figures saw Egg gain 15 to 182p Merrill Lynch reiterated its strong buy and 200p target after the online bank's first-quarter results showed a strong performance by Egg's core UK operation Merrill said profit from Egg's core UK business of £4 1m was above their forecast of £2 6m Wellington Underwriting jumped 7{1/2} to 72{1/2}p after the company announced it had increased its underwriting capacity by 50 per cent after doing a deal with Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett's investment group Unilever underperformed a buoyant food manufacturing sector with the shares falling 11 to 580{1/2}p ahead of tomorrow's first-quarter results in spite of expectations that these will show a considerable rise in profits By Peter John and Maria Roche,2
2002-04-13, There has been growing disappointment with technology companies in recent weeks In spite of swathes of good economic data suggesting industrial and consumer demand is about to revive techs still seem to be lost in the woods Things came to a head this week when IBM the world's biggest computer company issued its first profit warning for more than 10 years IBM said it would miss analysts' estimates for first quarter revenues by at least $1bn Some of the shock was tempered by questions about IBM's internal politics New boss Sam Palmisano only took over five weeks earlier and there is a tradition for incoming chief executives to paint the past darker to make their own future look brighter But when IBM speaks the world notices One company that duly noticed was Germany's Software AG a European leader in data management systems It took the opportunity the next day to say effectively me too hacking another {XEU}10m off the first quarter revenue forecast Shares already near a record low promptly fell another 30 per cent Europe's IT sector which soared 80 per cent from its trough on September 21 started slipping back again in early December and has so far unwound about half that surge How much more will it lose How many more companies are going to report that the recovery they were hoping for this quarter is still not emerging Attention will turn next Thursday to SAP Europe's biggest software company Akber Khan strategist at Deutsche Bank says they are not expecting an IBM-type shock If they were going to announce a profit warning we think they would have done so already  But one bad omen came from PeopleSoft last week a Californian company in similar lines of business It warned earnings were going to miss forecasts because of the cautious economic environment If PeopleSoft selling into an already-installed base is struggling SAP may be facing an even tougher task Analysts at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney this week sounded a warning note Valuations continue to discount a strong second-half recovery in the market and we would be cautious of all but the highest quality names in the European software sector  But they think European companies with strong customer relationships will do better than US peers The technology team at WestLB Panmure are quite pessimistic IBM's revenue shortfall shows that total IT budgets are still tight We do not believe that a recovery will happen before the fourth quarter  Tech shares have a habit of getting ahead of themselves Investors clutch at any good news such as recovering chip prices thinking they will get ahead of the rush But what exactly are chip prices doing The benchmark D-Ram 128 megabyte chip which crashed from $15 in 2000 to just $1 by last October is now about $3 Hardly recovery as normally defined Steve Woolf semiconductor analyst at Commerzbank Securities says he thinks prices are rising because of manufacturer restocking rather than underlying consumer demand He worries there may be a false dawn unless further improvements emerge shortly Commerzbank reported that recovery stalled in February with world shipments of semiconductors falling 35 per cent month-on-month Tony Dolphin director of research and strategy at Henderson Global Investors says A lot of the turnround is an inventory thing  He describes the IBM warning and another at telecoms equipment maker Nortel as a bit of a reality check adding this year is not going to be as easy as people thought it was going to be Some of the most vulnerable shares may also be the most high profile Mobile phone maker Nokia which many analysts were expecting to go back above {XEU}30 earlier this year is now back down to almost {XEU}21 its lowest level since last October Per Lindberg telecoms analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein believes it is heading back down to {XEU}16 Last January Morgan Stanley's telecoms analyst Angela Dean set a 12-month price target of {XEU}15 Nokia also releases results on Thursday Next week will be full of interest In addition to Nokia SAP and Philips IBM's results on Wednesday should reveal more about how bad the first quarter really was ,2

2002-06-24, Brazil is under pressure On Friday the Real plunged to an all-time low against the dollar before recovering slightly in afternoon trading Spreads on the country's sovereign bonds have widened alarmingly The country's stock market Latin America's biggest has fallen to its lowest level this year International investors it seems are bailing out in droves The decision last week by Moody's the credit-rating agency to downgrade its outlook for Brazil has fuelled speculation that the country might be about to follow Argentina into default If it does the rest of Latin America could follow Many believe that would mark the end of the region's experiment with market-based reform and usher in an era of political and economic instability As if to underline the region's vulnerability Uruguay's currency lost about 10 per cent of its value last week after the country was forced to abandon its exchange-rate peg Brazil will be a litmus test for Latin America says Arturo Porzecanski head economist for emerging markets at ABN Amro in New York God help us all if it goes wrong  Until very recently all this would have seemed very unlikely The country had overcome the traumatic events of 1998 and 1999 when the government was forced to devalue its currency Just weeks ago international policymakers were singing Brazil's praises for exhibiting few if any signs of contagion from Argentina its deeply troubled neighbour The improving fortunes of many other emerging markets make Brazil's suffering even more puzzling So what is going on At the root of market concerns is Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva better known as Lula the presidential candidate of the Workers' party PT Since early May Lula's opinion poll lead over Jose Serra the ruling Social Democratic party PSDB candidate has increased significantly raising the possibility that the former metalworker will become Brazil's next president Born out of the militant trade union battles of the late 1970s the PT has become much more moderate in the past decade For example it has gained a reputation for clean government and responsible management in the cities and states where it has won local elections But the PT's recent move to the centre has revealed internal divisions A broad commitment to financial stability disguises rifts between party factions Lula's moderate majority faction known as the Articulation is opposed by many grass roots activists the party has 300000 members who tend to be opposed to the market economy and in favour of radical anti-capitalist reform Party leaders use language that reflects revolutionary traditions that might be difficult to reconcile with the market economy Economic principles agreed in December last year talk about a rupture with the existing economic model Jose Dirceu party president and a close ally of Lula says the PT represents a post-communist and post-socialist project in construction In spite of its experience at the local level the PT would face a steep learning curve if it were to win national power This would be a stern test in any event but the party could inherit a sharply deteriorating financial situation Brazil's economy is barely growing in the 12 months to March 31 it expanded by less than 0 5 per cent Yet public debt has increased to R$685bn £160bn or 55 6 per cent of gross domestic product With interest rates at 18 5 per cent and inflation at less than 7 per cent it is also expensive to service Interest payments represent about 9 per cent of GDP which means that to stop the debt becoming an even bigger burden the government has to run a large and unpopular surplus on the rest of its budget Worse still the government has had to offer guarantees linking returns to dollars or interest rates to entice investors to buy paper at these rates About 80 per cent of the debt is indexed in this way Sometimes even this has proved insufficient incentive to buy debt and the central bank has been forced to shorten maturities As a result more debt is due to be paid off in the first few months of the new administration than the government had hoped potentially increasing financial pressures As Eduardo Gianetti an economic historian says My fear is that even if the PT win they will inherit a situation that is so critical that won't have a chance to show how different they are  All these fears could be overblown For example there are many differences between Brazil and Argentina which defaulted on its debt last December Whereas Argentina was stuck with a fixed exchange rate Brazil's floating exchange rate has cushioned it against the kind of shocks a strong dollar or weak commodity prices that helped take Argentina down the path of disaster Whereas Argentina's debt was in dollars Brazil's is largely domestic mainly in local currency and for the most part held by Brazilian institutions While Argentina consistently missed International Monetary Fund targets Brazil has excellent relations with the IMF Fiscal management has been good and a fiscal responsibility law limits the potential for the kind of local government overspending seen in Argentina Last week it announced it was reacting to turbulence by drawing down on £7bn of an IMF credit line agreed last September and increasing the size of the fiscal surplus to 3 75 per cent of GDP In addition Wall Street is more worried than many local businesses about Lula In 1989 the leader of the local industry association said his members would be flocking to the airports if Lula won power Today business leaders are more sanguine Citing his ability to reach agreements with PT administrations in many Brazilian states and municipalities Luiz Furlan deputy president of the Sao Paulo Industrial Federation Fiesp says There has been a growing maturity of both the candidates and the private sector There is no call for a priori rejection  Lula's opinion poll lead does not mean he will win the contest Lula has been ahead in all three previous election campaigns he has fought only to fade away in the run-up to the election itself There are still more than three months before the first round takes place and most Brazilians are far more concerned about the possibility of reaching the final of the football World Cup The country's television electoral campaign which begins in August will have a decisive influence Fewer than one in five Brazilians have party affiliations and television propaganda helps many poorer and less-educated Brazilians to make up their minds Mr Serra will enjoy the lion's share of broadcasting time reflecting the congressional majority of the centre and centre-left PMDB and PSDB parties that are backing his campaign Even so for foreign investors who may never have visited the region the parallels with Argentina look ominous And the worry is that their perceptions could begin to influence events Yield spreads on Brazilian bonds reached 15 percentage points over US Treasuries this week the highest level since 1999 when many investors feared financial meltdown and a return to hyperinflation These high yields make it harder to reduce domestic interest rates depressing the economy and increasing the cost of debt service and fiscal pressures Last year in Argentina weak indecisive politics economic stagnation and a fiscal crisis combined to sink President Fernando de la Rua Brazil with its broader-based economy and more sophisticated political class is much better placed and may well avoid the same fate But all its leaders will need to be aware that they may have to defuse a time bomb As Raul Velloso a Brasilia-based specialist in public finances puts it The combination of political risk with fragile fiscal fundamentals is pure nitro-glycerine ,2
2002-06-27, It is a struggle to make money in the hedge fund world a struggle that has lasted for the last year and a half Hedge funds as a whole racked up a miserly 4 per cent return last year and half way through this year are on track to do little better Some people are starting to suggest that the answer to the problem is some hedge fund research and development the funds need to find a new strategy Strategy after strategy from merger arbitrage convertible arbitrage long/short equity investing and statistical arbitrage are all suffering in this lacklustre sideways-moving market Aside from distressed bonds and emerging markets there is very little to get excited about in the hedge fund world Everybody is looking for alpha observed Gil Caffray partner at Frontpoint Partners a Connecticut-based hedge fund firm referring to managers' efforts to outperform their markets Growing efficiency in those markets has also reduced arbitrage opportunities he added Meanwhile the hedge fund industry continues to grow at anear-record pace The Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory group put growth from both capital appreciation and inflows at $140bn last year TASS Research which also monitors inflows put figures lower and falling slightly in the first quarter Still both data sets show the industry growing at a nearly record pace One of the biggest issues caused by that growth is capacity Merger arbitrage funds are swamped with money because there are too few deals for them to invest in Convertible arbitrage funds risk becoming similarly swamped as new convertible issuance slows But there is a broader issue of a lack of opportunity in the market Even with leveraged hedge funds making up a small proportion of the $30000bn global equity market investors are struggling to make money Hedge funds are constantly seeking new opportunities Two big multi-strategy funds Tudor Investment and Citadel Investment Group recently hired people to boost their power trading efforts The theory is that the retreat of the big power companies has made trained personnel more available while opening up a large highly technical market The question hanging over that market is the extent of its liquidity after Reliant Resources CMS and Dynegy admitted to entering into round trip deals that exaggerated their revenues and the size of the market as a whole There are a handful of successfully institutionalised multi-billion dollar funds including Citadel and Tudor that could become hotbeds of hedge fund innovation They are seeking new products because they aim to provide strong returns across different business cycles So far however they have merely expanded into existing strategies rather than developing new ones Some investors think that may be enough I tend to think that the hedge fund world is the harbinger of change in the financial world says James Hedges manager of LJH Global Investments a fund of hedge funds It is far more diverse than it was 20 years ago  Firms like Julian Robertson's Tiger Management pioneered international equity investment Mr Hedges says More recently hedge funds evolved distressed investing as a new strategy and after that helped build the emerging markets business Mr Hedges says hedge funds are now expanding into the under-exploited markets of Europe and specialising in narrower equity sectors But others question whether that is sufficient One solution to the lack of hedge fund innovation according to Gabriel Burstein head of relative value sales and research at HSBC's equity derivatives group is to develop new hedge fund strategies Hedge funds' edge over traditional money managers has always been their ability to use finance's basic building blocks such as stocks and bonds in an imaginative way Traditional managers simply buy and hold equities Dr Burstein explains while hedge fund managers use equities in merger arbitrage statistical arbitrage convertible arbitrage and long/short equity Similarly hedge fund managers use bonds and derivatives in bewildering combinations that traditional managers would probably never attempt Mr Burstein has developed a strategy called macro-economic arbitrage that he thinks could go some way to filling the gap Global macro-economic funds tend to take directional risk unlike arbitrage funds which take advantage of temporary pricing dislocations Mr Burstein sees ample opportunities in the non-directional trading of assets which are hit by the same macro-economic stimuli For example an investor might take the view that German banks should trade relative to German insurers based on domestic interest rates Then if that relationship changes the investor sells the insurers and buy the banks There is other evidence of hedge funds thinking out of the box Framework Investment Group a newly launched New York-based firm headed by Andrew Gitlin a veteran hedge fund incubator says it is taking a new approach by trading commodities in both the physical and cash markets Framework can take delivery and store commodities in warehouses around the world This is useful because financial buyers who cannot take delivery of a commodity often duck out of commodities market just before settlement creating a short-term pricing discount The hedge fund world seems evenly split between those who think there is nothing new under the sun and those who believe hedge funds are constantly developing new ideas Nobody denies however that returns are tight and that some creative thinking might be necessary to boost them ,1
1998-04-03, Viag the large Munich-based industrial conglomerate said yesterday it was in talks with potential strategic partners for its personal computer distribution division However it refused to comment on reports it was planning a link-up with Tech Data of Florida that would create an business with combined sales of more than DM20bn $11bn a year Georg Obermeier chairman acknowledged Viag faced difficulties with Computer 2000 in which Viag acquired a majority stake only four years ago Computer 2000 the biggest distributor of personal computers in Europe has been hit by problems at its Ameriquest US operations but is expected to produce a profit this year In a German newspaper interview Mr Obermeier said Viag had learnt that this is a very international business with the most important manufacturers in the US or Asia In order to boost an international competitive partnership we would be prepared to put our stake in Computer 2000 into a strategic co-operation agreement Mr Obermeier said Viag holds 75 per cent of Computer 2000 Viag would not comment on whether strategic co-operation would mean a full-scale joint venture or a less drastic step But Mr Obermeier set as a condition of any deal that Computer 2000 should gain a leading international position Tech Data would not comment on German media reports that it was in talks with Viag but said it was looking to expand in Europe Last July Nasdaq-listed Tech Data acquired Macrotron the Munich-based computer trader ,1
2002-04-12, As Italy braced itself fora one-day general strike next week Savino Pezzotta the leader of the country's CISL trade union is a man to watch On Tuesday the CISL the second largest union in Italy will join the country's two other big union movements the CGIL and the UIL in a one-day strike against plans by Silvio Berlusconi prime minister to reform the country's labour laws But once the strike is over Mr Pezzotta an affable 57-year-old whose union has 4 3m members is likely to be a key player in negotiations between government and unions which may return Italy to industrial peace Sitting in his book-lined office in the centre of Rome Mr Pezzotta who spent 20 years working in a textile factory in the northern town of Brescia leaves little doubt that Tuesday's general strike will bring Italy to a standstill It will be strong and will have a very powerful following he says There will be big demonstrations too with millions in the streets  Nor is he in any doubt that Mr Berlusconi's government has brought this industrial action on itself because of the clumsy way it tried to push through its labour market proposals The government has mismanaged the talks inviting us to the negotiating table and then promptly saying that the talks were over he says They have given the impression that they see the relationship with the unions as something unimportant and marginal  But the critical point about Mr Pezzotta and his union is that they are prepared to be open-minded The CGIL the largest of the three unions is close to the Italian left and opposed to the Berlusconi government Sergio Cofferati its leader is increasingly seen as a potential political leader of the leftwing opposition But Mr Pezzotta says CISL is apolitical We have never had any prejudice against this government We know well that governments are made by the electorate not by unions It is not the business of unions to change governments  Tuesday's strike has been called because Mr Berlusconi is implementing a reform of the country's labour laws which may make it easier for employers to fire workers Mr Pezzotta insists that the government must scrap its plans But there is speculation that he and his union might accept some of those reforms in return for a different prize the creation of a properly funded system of unemployment benefit in Italy one that covers the millions of people who work outside its large enterprises Mr Pezzotta is strongly committed to the creation of an unemployment benefit fund He believes the union movement most of whose members work for big companies must increasingly turn its attention to defending the interests of those in small and medium-sized enterprises We are in a fortress protecting workers who are already well protected We need to get out of the fortress and protect those who have no support at all  To fund such a programme Mr Pezzotta wants the Italian treasury to invest between {XEU}500m and {XEU}750m £307m-£462m in a new unemployment benefit fund every year between now and the end of the legislature Over the next few weeks it will become clear whether the government can afford to make such a commitment It will also become clear whether the government will treat the unions with the respect they seek We want to be invited to a 'political' round table one where we are treated as people who can deal who can question and who can make proposals says Mr Pezzotta For regional reports www ft com/europe,1
2002-06-24, Currency markets will today deliver their verdict on whether the euro has been weakened by the recent buckling of the rigid fiscal discipline that underpins the single currency EU leaders meeting in Seville gave France Italy and Portugal more time to eliminate their budget deficits while Edmund Stoiber the frontrunner to become German chancellor in September warned that his country may need until 2006 Slower than expected economic growth and a diminishing political will to tackle deficits is putting the EU's growth and stability pact to its greatest test since the euro was launched But so far the markets have been distinctly untroubled by political developments driving the euro back towards parity with the crumbling dollar The European Commission which polices the stability pact insists it is vital for governments stick to their promises to bear down on budget deficits in order to maintain confidence in the currency The underlying fear is that if countries such as France and Germany retreat on commitments they have given then a free-for-all could develop with smaller countries following suit The EU summit in Seville endorsed a compromise deal hammered out by finance ministers in Madrid in the early hours of Friday morning for a watering down of the guidelines to France Portugal and Italy over their budget deficits France and Portugal have now been told to get their deficits close to balance in 2004 instead of to zero giving them extra room for manoeuvre Italy had a similar wording inserted and was told to have a close to balance budget in 2003 But all countries are stressing that their commitments could be invalidated if healthy economic growth assumptions 3 per cent in 2003 and 2004 in the case of France are not met The Italian government over the weekend jumped on the opportunity to cut taxes and spend more on unemployment benefits following the EU's decision to ease its deficit target Prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet in coming days is expected to announce tax cuts next year for low income households and for corporations two promises Mr Berlusconi failed to keep this year following his election in 2001 Italian officials also hailed the EU decision as a shift to a political approach to the stability pact highlighting a view that finance ministers at the Ecofin council are taking a more flexible approach to the stability pact than the Commission Edmund Stoiber the conservative favourite to win Germany's elections in September cast further doubt over the stability pact by raising the possibility he may seek to renegotiate his country's commitment to a close to balance budget in 2004 He said a balanced budget in 2004 was impossible mainly because of the poor financial situation of state and local governments We must achieve a balanced budget by 2006 he added Many currency traders believe modest budget deficits are not necessarily a bad thing and may help the eurozone recovery Gordon Brown UK chancellor is another who will not be too worried by a relaxation of the interpretation of the stability pact We have always argued that there should be more flexibility taking into account the position in the economic cycle the level of public debt and the need for investment in public services said a UK Treasury official But the European Commission insisted it was holding the line and that the Seville summit had confirmed that all EU members should have close to balance budgets in 2004 ,3
2002-06-12, With little significant activity in the primary market yesterday attention switched to secondary trading where bonds from Fiat the Italian vehicle maker were in the spotlight Spreads on the company's debt narrowed by about 30 basis points following changes in top management and in response to the affirmation by Standard & Poor's of Fiat's short-term debt rating of A3 Investors are now more confident that Fiat will keep its investment-grade credit ratings which recently looked in danger of falling into the sub-investment grade category Moody's Investors Service and Fitch are still reviewing the company's ratings Despite the rally in its debt analysts said Fiat's bonds might continue to be volatile The group still has challenges of debt reduction via asset sales and weak operating cashflow and we continue to expect fundamentals to remain weak for at least the next 12 months said analysts at UBS Warburg S&P has warned that Fiat's ratings could be cut within a year if the company does not meet its targets Fiat has recently reached a refinancing agreement with several Italian banks and plans to sell a majority stake in its vehicle leasing business Its euro-denominated bonds due 2011 were quoted at 230bp over government bonds yesterday The issues that did come to the market yesterday were mainly opportunistic transactions from financial institutions and a handful of deals in dollar-bloc currencies with Australian Canadian and New Zealand dollars tapped Canada Housing Trust guaranteed by the government of Canada issued a C$3 8bn issue International investor appetite for Canadian dollars has increased recently as the spread between Canadian and US government bonds has widened The five-year spread stands at 64bp and the Canada Housing Trust issue offers a further 14bp pick-up over that Marketing was continuing for one of the main deals this week a euro-denominated benchmark for General Electric Capital Corp the financing arm for General Electric GECC which has recently issued benchmark bonds in dollars yen and sterling plans to raise up to {XEU}4bn The {XEU}3bn to {XEU}4bn size is large for the eurozone debt market and it is not clear yet on which day this week orders will be filled and the issued launched The GECC bonds will offer a spread of 30bp to 35bp over the mid-swaps rate ,1
2002-06-26, Mahathir Mohamad Malay-sia's prime minister and the self-styled spokesman forthe developing and moderate Islamic world will leave office next year after 22 years in power the ruling party Umno said yesterday The 76-year-old will hand over power to Abdullah Ahmad Badawi his deputy in October 2003 after a carefully prepared transition The succession plan was welcomed by Malaysian politicians and investors I personally support Abdullah to take over the posts and I'll give full co-operation to him said Najib Razak Umno vice-president It's lanced the boil said Dominic Armstrong head of Singapore and Malaysia equities at ABN Amro Securities The biggest risk for investors in Malaysia what if something happens to Mahathir has now been removed  The transition arrangement leaving Dr Mahathir as prime minister for another 15 months until he hosts a summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference is designed to address that concern analysts said Dr Mahathir who first talked of standing down in 1995 unexpectedly announced his resignation on Saturday only to retract it almost immediately That tearful declaration was a moment of high drama broadcast live on national television Malaysian share prices which fell almost 4 per cent after Saturday's resignation announcement by the man who has brought the multiracial south-east Asian country from third world status to within sight of the first are expected to stay weak The markets may take a while to get comfortable with the idea of not having Mahathir there so it's a very savvy decision to give markets time to digest the news said David Fernandez head of Asian credit research at JP Morgan By contrast yesterday's clarification of the prime minister's decision seemed deliberately subdued with Umno's political leadership announcing Dr Mahathir's plans with Mr Abdullah in the centre as his senior colleagues declared their full support for him Observers noted that two Umno leaders the former finance ministers Razaleigh Hamzah and Anwar Ibrahim were not represented at yesterday's show of unity However Mr Abdullah dismissed suggestions that the long transition might be marked by political instability This is the time for party members to respect Dr Mahathir's intention to resign and be united in facing challenges in our struggle for the community our religion and the nation said Khalil Yaakob Umno secretary general and the government's information minister Support from Umno leaders is 100 per cent The question of infighting does not arise he said Only a year ago there had been predictions that Dr Mahathir would be swept aside in the wake of the Asian financial and political crisis At that time he blamed financial speculators for his country's difficulties He called for currency trading to be banned introduced capital controls and singled out George Soros the hedge fund manager as a moron Dr Mahathir also bore criticism from the west when he sacked Anwar Ibrahim his previously anointed successor who was put on trial and jailed on charges of sodomy and abuse of power The biggest challenge to his 14-party coalition has been from the Islamic party PAS which made big gains in the 1999 elections by attacking government corruption and allying itself with other opposition forces But in the changed environment since last September's terrorist attacks in the US the opposition alliance has splintered ,3

2002-06-26, Virt-X The danger of setting demanding targets is that you risk being branded a failure when you fail to meet them Thus it is with Virt-X the London-based electronic share trading system with the space-age name On its launch a year ago it aimed to boldly go where no other upstart equity system had gone before to capture 10 per cent of daily share trading in Europe's top 600 stocks in its first 12 months That is not as warp-speed as might appear since the business partly owned by the Swiss stock exchange and partly by investment banks started life as the main trading platform for Swiss blue chips accounting for over 7 per cent of European volume In the event it announced yesterday that it had captured 9 2 per cent of the European market in the first 12 months probably just good enough to prevent it being branded a failure but way short of the level needed to assure its success Some 95 per cent of its volume is still in the largest Swiss stocks where it claims to have won back market share from other exchanges and now accounts for 80 per cent of volume against 70 per cent when it started On paper Virt-X has a great deal going for it it is the first genuinely pan-European market with full integration of trading with clearing and settlement and it reckons large institutions trading European blue-chips could save on average about £60 a transaction in brokerage and settlement using its system But liquidity is the vital ingredient for any market and Virt-X has found it difficult to capture that from incumbents Traders like familiar systems and Virt-X has not in every case been able to offer best execution bid and offer prices better than or as good as its rivals And while investment bank back offices may salivate at its cost savings that cuts little ice with front office traders who have no financial incentive to use it Apart from the Swiss blue chips what liquidity it has is very much concentrated in the top 50 or so pan-European stocks Even so members apparently do not want it to cut back on its coverage which runs to more than 200 stocks It expects to make a small profit before and after tax when it announces its results for the six months to June 30 so for now it seems unlikely to face strong pressures from its owners for a dramatic change of course The investment banks will be happy to take a punt on it succeeding knowing that meanwhile it will help keep the incumbent exchanges honest Virt-X thinks increasing cost pressures on the banks will encourage them to use it more while its plans for a pan European central counterparty could be a longer-term spur to business But progress beyond the 10 per cent mark could be painfully slow and an eventual merger with a rival like the London Stock Exchange or Euronext might make a lot of sense Martin Dickson@ft com,2
2002-06-14, The dollar fell against major currencies yesterday following news of weak figures for retail sales and jobless claims The dollar's decline after the numbers were announced ended its muted recovery from Wednesday's slide when it had reached 17-month lows against the European currency By the close of London trading the euro had reached $0 9456 not far below Wednesday's closing price Sterling had risen a touch on the day to $1 473 with the euro little changed against the pound at £0 642 The yen gained further against the dollar which was down more than half a yen and trading just below the Y125 mark by the close of London trading  The US economic figures were disappointing but not disastrous Core US retail sales were down 0 4 per cent last month the sharpest drop since November Initial jobless claims in the latest week were up by 6000 at 390000 The problem remains the persistent worry over US corporate earnings based on fears that sharp competition will mean a profitless recovery and even that some of the profit of previous years was an illusion based on creative accounting Dollar bulls might argue that the long-term fundamentals of the eurozone hardly look promising Wim Duisenberg president of the European Central Bank acknowledged yesterday that if the eurozone wanted to preserve its cultural diversity it would never be able to reach the higher rate of potential growth of the United States He said that different languages and cultures in the eurozone were natural barriers that discouraged workers from moving around in search of jobs The ECB's monthly bulletin published yesterday morning was hardly more encouraging about shorter-term prospects The bulletin commented gloomily on the inflation outlook  Brazil's football team may have sailed through the World Cup group stage but back home the currency has not had such an easy ride The Brazilian real climbed sharply off Wednesday's eight-month lows against the dollar yesterday on reports that the government would announce a deal with the IMF to help the situation On Wednesday the dollar rose to 2 797 reals but by early New York trading yesterday it had fallen back to 2 68 reals Concerns over the government's ability to service its debt and unease surrounding the possible outcome of presidential elections in October have weighed on the real this year steepening sharply in recent weeks There is certainly some backing for these concerns but the size of the move we've seen is not really justified said Mitul Kotecha global head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole Indosuez The real is down more than 18 per cent from its R$2 26 high in April Aside from Brazil's domestic issues Mr Kotecha said the real was also the victim of general investor caution towards South American assets this year In Argentina where the government is still struggling to broker a crucial deal with the IMF the peso has fallen about 70 per cent since breaking its peg with the dollar Mexico's peso has fallen more than 7 per cent while the Venezuelan bolivar is down 31 per cent since the government abolished controls in February  The New Zealand dollar failed once more to breach technical resistance at $0 4935 yesterday against the US dollar but was expected to break through soon to resume its upward trend It has gained about 18 per cent this year against its US counterpart But in a reminder that its rise is proving unwelcome in many quarters Winston Peters head of the nationalist New Zealand First party said the sharp appreciation of the currency was damaging exporters' prospects Mr Peters blamed its rise in part on too tight a monetary policy by the country's central bank New Zealand's benchmark interest rate has already started rising at a time when the central banks of the US eurozone and UK are still waiting for clearer signs of recovery ,2
2002-04-25, Before Jean-Marie Le Pen's ballot box success in France next Thursday's local elections in England were creating little excitement An ICM poll this week suggested turnout could fall to 25 per cent compared with a record low of 28 per cent four years ago Whether the publicity will encourage more to vote remains to be seen It has certainly brought two related issues into focus the rise of the extreme right and disaffection with mainstream politics On the former there is cause for concern rather than alarm The far right remains more marginal in Britain than in many European countries Mr Le Pen received 17 per cent of the national vote a figure no British far-right party has won even in a single constituency On Thursday the British National party is putting up just 68 candidates in 5878 seats In spite of riots in some northern towns and cities last summer race relations are better than many would have forecast at the time of Enoch Powell's rivers of blood speech in 1968 There has been genuine if stumbling progress towards a multicultural society in most places Nonetheless the BNP is on the up At last year's general election it averaged nearly 4 per cent of votes per candidate higher than far-right parties have achieved for more than 30 years It did well among white working-class communities in the north-west Nick Griffin the party leader polled 16 per cent in Oldham near Manchester A low turnout next week could allow the BNP to take a seat in both Oldham and Burnley In Burnley where the BNP won 11 5 per cent of votes at the general election it is fielding candidates in 13 out of 15 wards A BNP advance and a low turnout would produce more hand-wringing about whether mainstream politicians are out of touch with the electorate But the public has responsibilities too if France felt a sense of national guilt this week then surely the blame attaches as much to those who failed to vote or backed Trotskyite candidates as to Lionel Jospin for his dull campaign A generation is growing up that regards voting as a take-it-or-leave it consumer activity Yet there are limits to what can be done to liven up politicians' image policymaking is a technical often dry business That is not to deny that there are serious policy implications Labour says it was right to respond to public concerns about crime and asylum David Blunkett the home secretary has talked of problems caused by immigrants who do not learn English and preventing asylum seekers from swamping the education system That approach may do something to limit the far-right growth that often happens under centre-left governments but there are deeper issues The most pressing is the level of basic skills in communities such as Burnley and Oldham The growth of higher education has allowed the brightest to escape to jobs in Manchester or Leeds fuelling resentment among those left behind Only when they have the skills to attract investors or stimulate local enterprise will they cease to blame their neighbours for their plight ,3
2002-06-06, The fall in the FTSE 100 below 5000 yesterday may simply seem like a knee-jerk response to Monday's big drop on Wall Street But it has sent the UK equity market right to the bottom of this year's trading range The rather dull performance of the market this year has disguised the frantic activity occurring underneath the surface As with 2000 and 2001 there has been a sharp dichotomy between the old and the new economies If you strip the TMT technology media and telecommunications sectors out of the market it was 3 7 per cent up on the year by the start of yesterday whereas the TMT sectors were down 28 per cent Indeed the overall market has only managed to be resilient in the face of the TMT slide because those sectors have a much lower weighting than they had in 2000 Technology stocks are continuing to suffer from the deflation of the bubble valuations that applied in 1999-2000 And the telecom growth story has been dented by the slowdown in sales and the delays in the introduction of third generation phones The UK also seems to be suffering from the technical problem that pension funds are gradually reducing their exposure to equities in part because of the increasing maturity of their membership and in part because of the accounting standard FRS17 But macro factors have also weighed on the market as illustrated by the sluggish performance of the US and continental European indices The global political situation remains turbulent with the threat of an Indo-Pakistani war now added to Middle East violence and the danger of further terrorist attacks The global economy is certainly recovering but investors still have doubts about the length and the strength of the upturn They also fear that central banks will look to reverse some of the post-September 11 emergency rate cuts later this year There is even an outside chance that the Bank of England could announce a rate rise today Furthermore the Enron scandal seems to have undermined investors' faith in the health of corporate accounts Every week there seems to be some additional piece of bad news from the US to keep investors on edge as with this week's resignation of Tyco's chairman and chief executive The high debt levels taken on by the US corporate sector during the boom years is also weighing on sentiment 2001 saw a record level of corporate bond defaults Finally the market faces the problem that valuations are simply not that compelling Some will argue that equities look cheap relative to bonds nevertheless an historic price-earnings ratio of 22-23 and a dividend yield of 2 7 per cent are not levels at which investors go bargain-hunting None of this necessarily means that Footsie cannot stabilise at the bottom of its range The UK market with its high oil bank and pharmaceutical weightings has solid defensive qualities and as strategists such as Eric Lonergan of Cazenove point out still looks attractive relative to other markets The fundamentals may also improve The pound's recent weakness should revive the fortunes of the manufacturing sector while it seems likely that official GDP data for the first quarter will eventually be revised upwards But sadly for investors any rebound seems unlikely to usher in a new bull run but will simply confirm that Footsie is stuck in its narrow trading range ,2
2002-04-30, General Motors is today expected to complete its long-awaited $400m takeover of bankrupt Daewoo Motor strengthening the US car giant's position in Asia and saving the South Korean manufacturer from extinction GM's entry into South Korea will shake up one of Asia's largest car markets worth $11 4bn last year and strike a blow for foreign manufacturers in a country where 97 per cent of all sales are made by domestic carmakers The expected endorsement today of South Korean chipmaker Hynix Semiconductor's proposed $3 4bn partial sale to Micron Technology of the US would further strengthen the flow of foreign investment into Seoul and advance the country's globalisation Analysts said a revived Daewoo would intensify competition for Hyundai Motor which together with its affiliate Kia Motors has grabbed a 70 per cent share of the domestic market since its biggest rival collapsed two years ago under $10bn of debts To combat the threat posed by GM Hyundai is expected to increase its focus on overseas sales and deepen its own international alliance with DaimlerChrysler the US-German auto group which owns 12 per cent of the South Korean company GM faces an uphill battle reviving consumer interest in Daewoo whose market share has halved to 10 per cent as investment dried up and bankruptcy took its toll on the brand Analysts forecast that it will take three years for Daewoo to reclaim the 20 per cent market share it enjoyed before its collapse Daewoo's brand image is not very good says Lee So-youn a 24-year-old Hyundai-driving student I would not trust it  Daewoo could fall further out of favour with South Korea's notoriously patriotic consumers once it passes into US ownership On the other hand success by GM in South Korea might help change attitudes towards foreign carmakers A combination of national pride and import restrictions have made South Korea a barren market for overseas carmakers which had only 3 per cent of sales last year Car manufacturing is one of Korea's main industries so it is better that we buy Korean cars says Kim Kwang-hee a 48-year-old housewife who drives a Hyundai Seoul is under pressure from the international community to lift trade barriers There are signs that attitudes among consumers could be changing as South Korea shakes off its hermit kingdom reputation and becomes more globalised German cars such as BMW and Mercedes have been claiming a growing share of the luxury market and 2 per cent of the total market as South Koreans learn to flaunt their new found wealth and seek individuality I would consider buying a foreign car says Ms Lee I'm tired of all those same designs  However after GM's acquisition of Daewoo there are few remaining alliance partners to ease foreign carmakers' entry into the mass market Therefore the likes of Ford which commanded just 0 1 per cent of sales in South Korea last year and Toyota with 0 4 per cent must rely on imports if they are to make a mark Any changes in the South Korean market are likely to be gradual following GM's entry suggesting that Hyundai need not be too concerned We're not worried by GM says a Hyundai official Our domestic market share will go down a little bit perhaps by 5 per cent over the next five years especially in small cars but we can more than compensate through increased overseas sales and by focusing on more profitable cars at the high end of the market  Hyundai has reinvented itself in recent years from a volume producer of cheap cars for domestic consumption into a globally competitive manufacturer of higher quality vehicles such as its Santa Fe or Sonata Hyundai's exports have more than doubled since 1998 to 59 per cent of total sales and tripled in the US It began construction this month of a $1bn car plant in Alabama to cope with surging US demand Yesterday it finalised an agreement to build a factory near Beijing with a Chinese partner further underlining the company's global expansion DaimlerChrysler is thought to be planning a joint engine development project with Hyundai and Mitsubishi of Japan its two Asian partners lending credence to speculation that Hyundai and DaimlerChrysler could strengthen ties Hyundai's globalisation and GM's entry into South Korea following the lead of France's Renault which bought Samsung Motors two years ago suggests that one of the world's most closed car markets could at last be opening but only very slowly ,1
2002-04-10, Britain has signed an agreement with Taiwan to prevent double taxation and tax dodging Officials say the deal will strengthen bilateral business ties Negotiations were complicated by the lack of diplomatic relations between Taipei and London which maintains only unofficial ties with Taiwan out of deference to China's claim to sovereignty Taiwan's foreign ministry said the agreement signed in London on Monday would allow it to forge similar agreements with other European Union and Commonwealth governments It was the 17th double taxation agreement reached by Taiwanese negotiators whose efforts to smooth integration into the global economy are constrained by the diplomatic isolation imposed on it by Beijing The agreement would help to promote trade investment cultural exchanges and exchanges of information technology specialists The tax pact is technically between the Taiwanese representative office in London and its British counterpart in Taipei although its description as an agreement rather than a mere arrangement has been enough to satisfy Taiwanese hopes for a modicum of bilateral formality It remains short of the full tax treaties the UK has signed with countries it recognises Britain has pacts covering intellectual property and culture with Taiwan so it breaks no new diplomatic ground This should help strengthen trade and investment relations between the UK and Taiwan and help our companies over there the Foreign Office said But it does not affect our view on the position of Taiwan  The agreement completed after demands for action from British companies is expected to take effect in spring 2003 It has to be ratified by Taiwan's Executive Yuan or cabinet parliamentary approval is required for changes to the UK tax code ,3
2002-04-27, A bitter pay dispute with the police has beenprovisionally resolved by thegovernment after the two sides reached a compromise on cutting overtime payments The agreement follows the overwhelming rejection by police of an earlier proposal and a protest march on parliament by officers Under the deal forces will be charged with cutting the overtime bill by 15 per cent while an officer's basic pay will rise by at least £400 a year The total wage bill increases by £200m part of which includes payments related to performance The main advantage for the government is that the agreement hammered out at conciliation talks will not need to be ratified by a ballot of officers who rejected the earlier proposal by 10 to one Instead there will be a two-week consultation period with officers David Blunkett home secretary said the deal involved the most radical reform ever of pay and conditions We will now have a modernised pay structure and working conditions for the 21st century to go with the wider policing reforms we are introducing  He is about to embark on a high-risk attempt to rescue his troubled new law de-signed to shake up police forces by painting opposition peers who rejected parts of the police reform bill as soft on crime In two weeks' time he will reintroduce in the Commons clauses thrown out by Tory and Liberal Democrat peers in the past fortnight Politically we are on extremely safe ground said one Blunkett aide The Tories are providing government with the ammunition to say they are soft on crime The government is not going to back down  Tactically Mr Blunkett faces a problem if the opposition as seems likely does not back down If peers reject the measures again the home secretary would face the difficult choice of negotiating a compromise or seeing his new laws collapse Because the bill was introduced in the Lords MPs cannot use its powers to railroad the law through Yesterday Tony Blair used the Lords defeats to attack the opposition in a speech in Blackburn as part of Labour's local election campaign When it comes to law and order the Tories talk tough but act weak the prime minister said The Liberals offer sympathy for the victim but too little support for the police Only yesterday the Tories and Liberals voted down proposals to give chief constables new powers to employ civilian community support officers  Oliver Letwin shadow home secretary said he was willing to negotiate on the powers of support officers dubbed plastic policemen by opposition peers but would not budge on important powers Mr Blunkett was seeking to interfere in the running of police forces The Tories argue that giving support officers powers to detain suspects would undermine respect for the police and peers removed the powers of detention from the bill But without the detention powers support officers would be no more effective than the local milkman said a Blunkett aide ,3
2002-06-28, It was last December that Chinese officials announced Beijing's plans for a free trade area-style agreement with Hong Kong But so far the proposal in response to requests from the Hong Kong government and its business leaders has been moving at a glacial speed China it seems has been dragging its feet on requests for help from Hong Kong as it responds first to domestic business concerns Beijing is seeking to shore up its sagging local stock markets and is therefore reluctant to push ahead with initiatives that would direct a flow of funds to Hong Kong say observers The difficulties surrounding the free trade area mirror those concerning a plan last year to allow qualified institutional investors in China to invest on the Hong Kong stock market Five years since Hong Kong was returned to China on July 1 1997 the city is struggling through its second economic slowdown in four years Gross domestic product growth last year was a measly 0 2 per cent and its pleas for help from China whose economy grew by more than 7 per cent last year have grown insistent This is a dramatic role reversal from five years ago when the former British colony was viewed as the energetic tugboat pulling the Chinese battleship into the global economy Sceptics have dismissed the notion of a taskforce announced by the two governments in March that will determine rules covering manufactured goods entering the mainland from Hong Kong Christine Loh a former legislator describes such initiatives as mood enhancers efforts by China to lift Hong Kong out of its economic doldrums while giving as little as possible away This is because Hong Kong is predominantly a service economy in which services account for more than 85 per cent of GDP Even economists are scratching their heads to remember what the city still manufactures The Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce a main advocate of the free trade area-style proposal admitted a few weeks ago that agreements concerning crucial sectors such as financial services and telecommunications could take as long as three years However Andy Xie an economist with Morgan Stanley warns that these frequent requests for preferential access could become a perennial headache for China Hong Kong has become a burden  That judgment may be too harsh but Beijing is well aware that preferential access for Hong Kong companies in such sectors as banking and telecoms would provoke protests from the US and European Union Both lobbied hard for licences for their own companies ahead of China's accession to the World Trade Organisation The proposed Closer Economic Partnership Agreement between China and Hong Kong has already sparked a controversy in Hong Kong The British Chamber of Commerce voiced concern over proposals by some Hong Kong companies to limit the beneficiaries to those companies whose primary stockholders are ethnic Chinese The free trade area proposals could absorb a lot of government time and energy and amount to little China's telecoms and banking industries are likely to resist early entry for Hong Kong companies ahead of the agreed WTO schedule for foreign companies Earlier this year Dai Xianglong head of China's central bank said lowering hurdles for Hong Kong banks would open the door for innumerable western banks as well However Antony Leung Hong Kong's financial secretary says there is nothing wrong with the government seeking to improve access for Hong Kong companies I know how American firms work with the American government to improve market access I intend to work on this if needed on a much more bilateral basis  In any case a broad-based if modest recovery appears to be on its way which will give the city a boost even without preferential access to China's markets No one is predicting as robust a rebound as the city enjoyed in 2000 when its economy surged by more than 10 per cent but it may be premature for Hong Kong to be approaching Beijing for handouts See Editorial Comment,3

2002-06-28, The Johannesburg Stock Exchange shrugged off global jitters over US accounting standards and corporate ethics yesterday closing fractionally up at 10531 02 Despite the negative fallout from international markets there is a new optimism in the air The JSE has been one of the best performing stock markets in the world this year and many analysts believe it is poised for further strong growth due to a healthy corporate sector and the feeling that both inflation and interest rates are likely to fall Gains are likely to be substantial says Charles de Kock of Old Mutual Asset Managers in Cape Town There is little doubt that our local equities are offering excellent value and in the absence of fresh falls by the rand and the usual caveat of no new economic shocks I would not be surprised to see the all-share index rise some 20 per cent possibly even higher  Corporate South Africa is in good shape says Mr de Kock with little debt and high liquidity levels and the equity market is cheap because it has not priced in the positive news on inflation and interest rates likely to come later in the year I am optimistic because South African stocks are undoubtedly undervalued says Patrick Mathidi chief dealer at Investec Asset Management in Cape Town Unfortunately given the global outlook it is difficult to justify higher levels from a sentiment point of view There will be very cautious stock-specific buying  Resources have driven the JSE this year particularly gold stocks following the rally in the gold price and the metal's renewed favour with investors as a safe haven But looking forward it is the financial sector that shows the most promise analysts say We are at the top of the rate hike cycle so banking stocks look particularly promising says Mr Mathidi Investec in particular appears considerably underpriced given the forthcoming London listing says Mr de Kock Investec a South African specialist banking group announced last week that it will proceed with a global offering of shares in Investec PLC on July 29 London was on all traders' minds this week as the JSE switched to a new classification system adopted the indices used by the FTSE and introduced a free float system Only investable shares will be included when calculating what weighting a company should be given in the index The creation of the FTSE/ JSE Africa Index Series which follows last month's adoption of Sets the LSE's electronic trading system is part of a move to raise the JSE's international profile and to attract more foreign investors also stemming the exodus of South African companies abroad The implementation of the new indices was a success traders and analysts said There have been no glitches and the system is working well says Mr Mathidi What remains to be seen is whether it will succeed in attracting foreign investors to the JSE  Nicol Degli Innocenti,2
2002-04-08, Switzerland has scored another corporate victory over Sweden Little more than a month after Martin Ebner Switzerland's leading corporate activist forced two of Sweden's best-known business leaders to pay back over half their SFr233m $139 8m pay-offs from ABB the troubled engineering giant Sweden's Nobel Biocare the world's leading dental implant company is defecting to Switzerland Nobel Biocare's decision to transfer its parent company to Switzerland follows the arrival on the board last year of Ernst Thomke a well-known Swiss company doctor who is now the company's chairman and Heliane Canepa Switzerland's entrepreneur of the year in 1999 who took over as chief executive last August The move to Switzerland will not lead to any loss of jobs in Gothenburg the group's operational headquarters However it has dealt another blow to the corporate pride of a country that already lags well behind the smaller Switzerland There are only seven Swedish multinationals in the FT's latest global 500 compared with Switzerland's 11 Sweden has also been less successful than some countries in generating young new growth companies Hence the loss of a technologically driven company like Nobel Biocare with a dominant world market share is likely to accentuate the agonised debate in Sweden about its companies moving abroad Sweden's high corporate tax rate was a primary reason for the move Last year Nobel Biocare paid out 43 per cent of its profits in taxes By moving to Switzerland it expects the rate to fall to 20-25 per cent Nobel Biocare's shares jumped by 13 per cent last week to SKr558 Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs issued buy notes with Goldman Sachs setting a SKr750 price target The new Swiss holding company will maintain a Swedish share listing But it is expected to report results in Swiss francs and the bulk of its share trading is expected to move to Zurich Nobel Biocare has an estimated 33 per cent share of the global market for dental implants compared with the 21 per cent market share of Straumann its main competitor which is based in Switzerland ,1
2002-04-01, A commission handpicked by the United Nations in Kabul yesterday released a set of rules to govern the election of a special council the Loya Jirga that will convene in June to choose a new head of state and government in Afghanistan The rules are likely to be controversial as they are vague in critical areas and grant the 21-member Loya Jirga commission broad powers to interpret them They allow the commission to disqualify prospective members for past offences such as killing of innocent people something that could apply to a large number of the Afghan power elite in the wake of a 23-year civil war The Jirga commission has been very pressed for time and the members argue is therefore unable to implement a general election within the June timeframe specified by last December's Bonn peace agreement Instead they have proposed an indirect election whereby people choose representatives using tribal custom The commission laid out these procedures yesterday at apress conference in Kabul Starting on April 13 electoral districts throughout Afghanistan will choose 20-60 representatives in the traditional way and these representatives will then vote in secret ballots to elect 1051 members A further 399 will be chosen from minority and women's groups Eight regional observation centres based in cities throughout Afghanistan and controlled by commission members will be responsible for ruling on all disputes and their decisions will be final according to the procedures Article 14 of the procedures gives the commission the power to disqualify prospective members for crimes such as looting smuggling killing innocents and war crimes The question of how broadly this is interpreted comes down to a fundamental debate still raging in Kabul political circles whether to include former Taliban and other warlords in the peace process By including them said one western diplomat one risked adopting their agendas But excluding them could be just as perilous he said as they then had no stake in the peace process If it takes too visible a role in the Jirga selection the commission is likely to draw criticism that it is simply an arm of foreign interference in Afghanistan The commission was provided for in the Bonn peace agreement and was handpicked by Lakhdar Brahimi the United Nations special envoy to Kabul It is entirely Afghan and includes mainly liberal academics Abdul Rasul Sayyaf a powerful figure in the Northern Alliance warned If the Loya Jirga comes through the wish of the Afghan nation then it will solve the problem of peace If this Jirga was created by the selection of others then the problems will remain  Many members of the Northern Alliance believe the commission is simply a vehicle to bring Afghanistan's former King Zahir Shah back to power He is scheduled to arrive back in Afghanistan this month and will chair the Loya Jirga Security was also likely to be a problem for the commission-appointed observers diplomats said One senior diplomat said they were looking at ways to use ISAF the UN-backed peacekeeping force in Kabul as bodyguards for the observers www ft com/afghanfuture,3

1998-04-30, Venezuela's petroleum industry will provide investment opportunities worth approximately $10bn to the private sector as it outsources more non-core activities Petroleos de Venezuela PDVSA state petrol company plans to focus on its long-term plan to increase oil production capacity from 3 5m barrels per day to around 6 3m b/d by involving the private sector in other aspects of its business PDVSA's exploration and production division is seeking $5bn in private capital to finance a port terminal gas compression units as well a power distribution system in eastern Venezuela said Ronald Pantin division vice-president Investment in exploration and production will total $49bn between 1998 and 2007 PDV Marina shipping subsidiary is seeking a strategic alliance with an international shipping company to expand its fleet by between 40 and 50 vessels It would carry half of the total cost of $4bn over 10 years Other non-core activities subject to outsourcing include engineering aviation purchasing storage and maintenance Of the 40 activities that could be transferred to the private sector said Mr Pantin the most important were a number of heavy infrastructure projects PDVSA's decision to increase outsourcing comes after a drop in oil revenues forced expenditure and cost cuts worth $1 8bn for 1998 PDVSA also announced this week that it would launch an ambitious plan to acquire foreign power companies in an attempt to help market its trademark boiler fuel Orimulsion The idea said Mr Pantin was similar to PDVSA's acquisition of oil refineries and vehicle fuel stations in Europe and the US in the 1980s to market its heavy crude oil and its derivatives ,1
2002-06-27, Switzerland's role as one of the world's more defensive stock markets in turbulent times has been thrown into question over the last few weeks as shares of some of its best-known blue chips have taken a pounding Admittedly the decline in the Swiss Market Index since the start of the year is little more than half that of comparable indices in London Paris and Frankfurt Nevertheless the recent sharp falls in the share prices of well-known Swiss financial stocks in particular have sorely tested investor confidence Credit Suisse a bank whose history goes back more than 100 years has been one of Europe's worst performing bank stocks with a near 40 per cent decline since the start of the year The same goes for Zurich Financial Services an insurance conglomerate with more than 35m customers whose shares are down over a quarter Swiss Life the country's biggest life assurer has fallen by around 50 per cent UBS Warburg's Cyrill Moser says a lot of company and management specific issues have rattled the Swiss market The profits of ZFS Swiss Life and Credit Suisse have all collapsed because of their over-exposure to equity markets either through their insurance portfolios or their investment banking operations ZFS and Swiss Life have already changed their chief executives and there are rumours that Credit Suisse may soon follow suit Patrick Lambert head of research at Pictet in Geneva says there is a general perception that equities are much riskier than they used to be and accounting concerns have raised doubts about the relevance of historical multiples That said Pictet believes investors should take advantage of weakness in the market to strengthen their position in companies like Nestle the world's biggest consumer food company Swiss Re the world's number two insurer Givaudan number two in flavours and fragrances and Syngenta the agrochemicals company While analysts have long cited Switzerland's two big pharma companies Novartis and Roche as the main reason for the Swiss stock market's defensive qualities a look-back over a longer period shows that Nestle remains the country's best defensive stock Based on figures from Bank Vontobel's excellent monthly stock market guide Nestle accounted for a third of the increase in the overall capitalisation of the Swiss stock market since 1997 Its market value increased 76 per cent compared with a 5 per cent increase in the value of Novartis and 11 per cent decline in Roche Swiss Re whose value has risen nearly 48 per cent since end 1997 is the other big star In contrast Credit Suisse which has spent some SFr35bn on acquisitions has seen its market value fall by around SFr10bn over the same period ZFS despite several sizeable acquisitions has also failed to enhance its own value Nestle one of Europe's very few triple A rated companies was heavily criticised by some analysts during the long bull market for not doing more to maximise shareholder value Investors can be thankful that Nestle's conservative management did not bow to these demands and only wish that a few more Swiss companies had followed its big and boring example William Hall,2
2002-06-19, Concerns about lack of financial transparency are resurfacing in Nigeria The senate yesterday voted to debate in secret allegations that the government mismanaged finances including almost $100m £68 4m of stolen money recovered from the family of General Sani Abacha the late dictator Anyim Pius Anyim the senate president declared proceedings would go into closed session to consider matters of national importance a phrase familiar to the many watching journalists who repeated it in sardonic riposte The senate debate centred on a devastating report prepared by the public accounts committee which scrutinised the country's budgeting and public spending since President Olusegun Obasanjo's election in 1999 Mr Obasanjo has frequently promised to tackle the public corruption that has helped cripple the country since independence in 1960 You start solving your problems by first of all admitting their existence said Idris Abubakar committee chairman The committee which submitted its report to the senate last week claimed government spending had breached constitutional rules and had contributed to a virtual slide into financial anarchy The report highlighted a discrepancy between the N40 7bn £230m of Abacha money officially recovered so far and the N29bn recorded in the budget as revenue The government announced earlier this year it had reached a settlement with Gen Abacha's family under which they would pay back $1bn and keep $100m of disputed funds The committee criticised the government for contravening the constitution through spending items such as a 1999 grant of $10m made to the government of Niger It said a glaring example of mismanagement was a $13m interest-free loan made to the police force of Ghana in April almost the same time as Nigeria's police went on strike over unpaid entitlements The financial management issues are familiar to students of politics in Nigeria which has suffered four decades of corrupt rule by both military and civilian governments The country which is Africa's most populous nation and one of the world's top 10 oil producers has seen real incomes decline by an average of 1 5 per cent per year over the past 25 years The election is a crucial test for a country that has never managed to hold two successive polls without suffering a military takeover The army took over from civilian governments in the 1960s and the 1980s after presidential polls seen as fraudulent Mr Obasanjo a former military ruler who spent time in prison under Gen Abacha is under pressure to show that he is honouring his commitment to end the culture of corruption and curb the power of the political old guard Former leaders such as Muhammadu Buhari and Ibrahim Babangida who annulled elections held in 1993 still have influence and are potential presidential candidates Supporters of Mr Obasanjo whose election ended a 16-year spell of military rule point to his credentials as a founder member of Transparency International the international anti-corruption organisation Oby Ezekwesili special adviser to the president on budget issues says the public accounts committee report is the product of grandstanding by political opponents on the committee She says the anti-corruption drive has resulted in the setting up of a team that vets all large tranches of spending to ensure they are legitimate Anti-corruption reform is the most difficult reform to carry through she says But the president has given his unflinching commitment to it  The dispute between the public accounts committee and Mr Obasanjo reflects a wider tension over what the balance of power between the president and parliament should be Mr Obasanjo clashed with the national assembly earlier this year after it voted to add N250bn of spending to the budget taking the total to N1065bn Udoma Udo Udoma chairman of the senate appropriation committee and a member of Mr Obasanjo's People's Democratic party publicly criticised the president last week for portraying the senate as irresponsible and spendthrift The senate debate which was adjourned until today cast little light on the fate of the Abacha money or funds from privatisation that are allegedly unaccounted for The first public part of the proceedings ended amid farce after a power cut rendered the microphones inoperative and led the senate president to call for the closed session to start I say that it's deliberate said one observer That is the kind of thing we experience here  www ft com/mideastafrica,3
2002-06-07, The US said yesterday it would recognise Russia as a market economy a decision that may ease future trade restrictions against Russia and help boost the country's prospects for membership of the World Trade Organisation The decision means Russia will now be treated in the same way as other US trading partners when the US levies duties to protect against unfair trade Russia had been hoping for the announcement in time for President George W Bush's visit to Moscow and Saint Petersburg last month and the delay allowed the European Union to seize the initiative last week by making its own pledge to declare Russia a market economy In reaching the decision the US said Russia had substantially ended government control over production and the allocation of resources allowed free bargaining over wages and was open to foreign investment The move could give Russian exporters greater protection from anti-dumping actions in the US by making it easier for them to reject allegations that they are selling goods below cost in the US market The US currently refuses to accept Russian price data instead relying on surrogate data that usually result in higher tariffs being levied against dumped products Russia has been hit recently with high US tariffs on its fertiliser and steel exports German Gref Russia's economy minister said yesterday this would mean new possibilities for the domestic economy He said better US market access for Russian goods should encourage more direct investment in local manufacturing The decision could also help Moscow in its efforts to accede to the WTO In US talks with China which recently joined the WTO the US insisted that China not be given full recognition as a market economy one of the most difficult points in the negotiations Moscow is now unlikely to face the same hurdle But the main effect of the decision may be a psychological one easing a sticking-point in US-Russian relations Russia still wants the US to exempt it from the Jackson-Vanik amendment a cold-war holdover limiting normal trade relations But the US Congress has been slow to do this largely in irritation at Russian restrictions on imports of US poultry which have recently been eased Yesterday's decision came despite pressure from some members of Congress who said that Russia had not yet met the standards to be treated as a market economy The US earlier this year recognised Kazakhstan as a market economy and is also considering a request to give Ukraine the same treatment ,3

2002-04-12, The US Senate is set to crack down on a growing number of companies that have moved their head offices to tax havens offshore to reduce their tax payments in the US The legislation to be introduced by the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate finance committee would block companies from renouncing their US corporate citizenship simply by setting up a shell office abroad The bill to be known as the Repo Act responds to rising anger in Congress over decisions by a number of US companies to move to Bermuda and other low-tax jurisdictions These have included Ingersoll-Rand the industrial manufacturer Accenture the former consulting arm of Andersen and Tyco International the conglomerate Some companies have also taken advantage of depressed stock prices since the September 11 terrorist attacks to execute the move which is less costly when a company's share price is weak Shareholders of Stanley Works the toolmaker are set to vote later this month on a move to Bermuda Charles Grassley the generally soft-spoken Republican on the finance committee yesterday accused the companies involved of being immoral for abandoning the US at a time of war and recession The bill which the Senate is likely to approve would prevent companies from escaping US corporate taxation simply by executing paper transactions to relocate their head office While the US taxes its companies on their worldwide income foreign companies are only taxed on their operations within the US Some members of Congress have also threatened to try to deny federal contracts to such expatriate companies Richard Neal a House Democrat has compiled figures showing that four of the large companies that have moved offshore have won more than $2bn £1 4bn in federal contracts One of those Accenture was even hired by the Internal Revenue Service to redesign its website The measure could also trigger a much broader debate over whether the US corporate tax system should be fundamentally overhauled House Republicans in particular are pushing for a complete rewrite of the corporate tax code The administration argues that the underlying problem is that higher corporate taxes have forced many companies to move offshore to remain competitive The Treasury department is set to release by the end of this month a study that will detail the problem The US is also under pressure from the European Union to end a tax scheme that the US says is critical to allowing American companies to compete with large European companies that face lower corporate tax burdens The World Trade Organisation has ruled that the scheme generally known as the Foreign Sales Corporation provision violates international trade rules The EU will be in a legal position by the end of this month to impose as much as $4bn in sanctions against the US if it refuses to end the tax break ,3
2002-06-25, Franz Fischler the Euro-pean Union's farm commissioner has taken everyone by surprise with the ambitiousness of his blueprint for reforming the controversial Common Agricultural Policy In a draft circulated last week for the consideration of other Commission departments Mr Fischler the Austrian commissioner has proposed the most radical changes to the CAP since the 1992 reforms driven through by a previous commissioner Ray MacSharry who slashed commodity prices and brought in direct payments for farmers If they survive the plans would live up to Mr Fischler's rhetoric to green the CAP which still costs the EU about {XEU}40bn £25 8bn a year They would also steal a march on the US in the agricultural chapter of trade liberalisation negotiations that was set in motion in Doha last year If this is what the proposals finally look like it would be very radical a quite dramatic shift from what we've seen in the past says Jo Swinnen professor of agricultural economics at the Catholic University of Leuven Under the plans direct subsidies to farmers would no longer be linked to what they produce Instead they would be a flat-rate payment based on what the farmer had received over recent years and would be pegged more closely to environmental animal welfare and food quality standards At the same time payments would be gradually reduced by 20 per cent over six or seven years and the money saved used to fund broader rural development measures Subsidies to an individual farm would be capped at {XEU}300000 a year The key to the proposals and the greatest surprise is the concept of decoupling payments from production At present farmers are paid subsidies based upon the number of animals they keep or the area of land they farm a system that is certain to fall foul of future agreements in the World Trade Organisation Generous domestic subsidies in the EU and US are one of the main bugbears of developing countries and the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting nations Mr Fischler's proposals coincide with the signing into law of the US Farm Bill which shifts US farm policy in the opposite direction by increasing domestic subsidies to US farmers making Washington's task in the Doha round more difficult Fischler is trying to keep the moral high ground in WTO terms but is also looking to improve the image of agriculture by moving the policy towards what the taxpayer is actually willing to pay for says Roger Waite editor of Brussels-based Agra Facts Last week Allen Johnson the chief US agricultural negotiator said Washington would welcome any reform that made the CAP less trade-distorting He said The EU spends three times more than we do on trade-distorting domestic support  The EU denies this Mr Fischler's plans are designed to achieve several goals No longer would 20 per cent of farmers receive 80 per cent of subsidies and the new regime would be more acceptable to taxpayers and consumers still reeling from a series of food scares It would also reduce bureaucracy for farmers allow them to escape from the straitjacket of having to orient their output to win subsidies and improve the CAP's environmental credentials Although the Commission maintains that reform is needed anyway even without EU expansion the proposed changes would also simplify and keep down the cost of the CAP in an EU of as many as 27 members But for all their apparent benefits the plans face a rocky road The re-invigorated President Jacques Chirac and his centre-right government in France are certain to raise fundamental questions Mr Fischler's last attempt to reform the CAP in 1999 was watered down at the last minute by the intervention of Mr Chirac Much will also depend on whether it is the centre-left or centre-right that wins Germany's general election in September Renate Kunast the German agriculture minister from the environmentalist Green party is a staunch supporter of radical change to the CAP According to Prof Swinnen the proposals also face more practical problems The link to environmental conditions looks great on paper But how do you implement it For regional reports www ft com/europe,3
2002-04-25, Celltech the biotechnology company yesterday reignited rumours that it would merge with Biogen of the US when the two struck an agreement to collaborate on a treatment for Crohn's disease and psoriasis The development and commercialisation deal is thought to have sprung from merger negotiations between June and October last year The companies refused to comment on suggestions that merger talks were back on stressing this was a stand-alone arrangement However one person close to last year's negotiations said the complementary strengths of Celltech's drug discovery and Biogen's product development were as compelling as ever This would be one of the greatest companies in the world in the treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases  A merger would create a company with a market capitalisation of £6bn Analysts said the way the collaboration had been structured suggested a merger as a subsequent possibility The companies will split research and development costs and future profits associated with CDP 571 used to treat Crohn's disease and psoriasis on a 50-50 basis Celltech said the deal enhanced projected peak-year sales on the product from $100m £69m to $300m about a quarter of which would come from treating psoriasis Peter Fellner chief executive said This transforms the prospects for CDP 571 It was a fill-in drug for us Now it becomes of far greater importance  CDP 571 is in the final Phase III stage of trials and is due to reach the market next year Celltech's shares rose 10{1/2}p to 630p but some analysts said the upside had been overplayed It's a well structured deal but it's only a minor positive said Ravi Mehrotra at SG Cowen He said trebling the sales forecast was over-optimistic I think even $200m would be overestimating sales  Much of Celltech's worth hangs on CDP 870 another preparation to treat Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis that is due to enter Phase III trials shortly Celltech said the agreement with Biogen gave it the right to withdraw from co-promotion of CDP 571 but retain its share of profits if CDP 870 came to market Yesterday Biogen re-ported flat first-quarter earnings of 47 cents per share in line with Wall Street consensus estimates ,1

2002-06-25, Almost one in 10 consumers have investible assets of £30000 or more despite stock market falls during the past year according to a new report Some 4 4m people had liquid assets of between £30000 and £200000 excluding property and pensions last year according to Datamonitor the business information group This is just 1 per cent down on 2000 About 2 per cent of the population have liquid assets of more than £200000 in assets Oliver Guirdham financial services analyst at Datamonitor said that many banks such as Lloyds TSB and Merrill Lynch HSBC had tried to target the mass affluent sector by launching new services Mr Guirdham believes many services such as Lloyds TSB's Create which closed to new business this year were unsuccessful because they were aimed at self-directed investors who do not want advice The reality of the mass affluent sector as not lived up to this hype he said Customer acquisition has proved expensive and difficult and the stock market downturn has severely impacted on revenues  Mr Guirdham estimates that such services need customers with assets above £135000 in order to be profitable and says that banks are now aiming at the upper end of the mass affluent market Datamonitor said that many established wealth managers were not suited to dealing with the majority of mass affluent clients with less than £100000 because of costs such as branch networks specialist staff and low client load The numbers of the mass affluent are expected to grow by 6 8 per cent per annum over the next five years www Datamonitor com,2

2002-06-17, In the port city of Szczecin close to the German border local government officials estimate only about a dozen bureaucrats in a region of 2m people properly understand the workings of the European Union It could be less they admit In the office of the elected marshal of the Szczecin voivodeship the regional authority just five staff deal with international co-operation including EU affairs And on the payroll of the voivode the top central government officer there are just three The shortages are so acute that the marshal admits the region cannot use the big increase in EU funds that is due to follow accession Jozef Jerzy Falinski says The administration is not yet ready as an administration for entry into the EU We know that this is important In many respects the preparation of Poland for accession depends not on the central government but on regional and local authorities  What is true for Szczecin is true for most of Poland Artur Lorkowski a regional affairs specialist at the government EU integration office calculates the number of officials required to handle EU-funded projects should be increased from 950 today to 2150 including an increase in the 16 voivodeships from 119 to 900 The gap can be filled mainly by transferring from existing posts says Mr Lorkowski But they must be trained and reorganised Nobody expects this can be done by 2004 when Poland is hoping to enter the union But without rapid progress Poland will not be ready to use EU funds because the European Commission will not release money for projects not prepared complete with paperwork Bruno Dethomas the EU delegation's head in Warsaw says administrative capacity in the capital and in the regions is his main concern in assessing Poland's preparations for membership The government has adopted a {XEU}52m EU-financed action plan for training of officials But it is clear the administrative machine will face great strains Mr Dethomas says Poland needs a precise classification of who does what at the levels of the region voivodeship district powiat and local community gmina He also says the government's long-awaited national development plan due this month comes after seven years' delay This lists projects ranging from local waterworks to national motorways The plan must be ready for the first years after accession 2004-06 for which the EU has earmarked {XEU}18bn-{XEU}20bn in aid for Poland of which {XEU}14bn is related to regional policy Otherwise the country will lose EU money Poland struggles to absorb even the much smaller amounts now available under pre-accession aid of about {XEU}1bn annually Mr Dethomas says of funds available under the Phare aid scheme for the year 2000 which must be allocated by November 2002 only 32 per cent has been contracted out Under Ispa the fund for big infrastructure schemes contracts were signed by late May for only 19 of 181 projects says Mr Dethomas Under Sapard the third large pre-accession fund aimed at agriculture and rural development no contracts have been awarded because the agency needed to supervise the projects has not been formally approved by the European Commission Polish officials hope to secure accreditation soon two years late Polish officials complain the Commission's rules are often complicated Mr Dethomas says the Commission must manage finances with care It's not easy to spend money We have very difficult procedures  One problem is that the present 16 voivodeships are new having replaced a network of 49 non-elected authorities inherited from communist times only three years ago Voivodeship marshals also complain they have been given insufficient funds to provide the local contributions that many EU schemes require To try to streamline financing procedures the government has recently transferred control of the national development programme from the regional affairs ministry to the more powerful economics ministry Ministers argue this will give a clearer economic focus to the programme Critics say the move reflects centralising tendencies on the part of the left-of-centre government whose supporters include many former communists However outside Warsaw regional officials say the identity of the controlling ministry is much less important than the supply of adequate funds Another obstacle is the difficulties faced by the authorities in acquiring land for example for road building European Commission officials say Polish laws for compulsory purchase are ineffective But they concede that change will be slow in a country where farmers are still closely bound to family plots owned for generations In Szczecin Mr Falinski says that he knows securing funds for regional development will depend on effective work by local officials Poland should learn from Ireland which uses EU funds successfully and not from Greece which has had many problems says Mr Falinski We can be Ireland or Greece We want to be Ireland ,3

2002-04-11, Higher pensions charges have contributed to a fall in full-year profits at James Beattie the department store operator The business was forced to write off £400000 against profits following an actuarial valuation that showed a drop in the surplus of its pension fund The decline was triggered by poor markets and performance by an investment manager described by James Beattie as unsatisfactory The company said yesterday that it expected to make a similar write-off this year but there should be no further charges The pension fund is reducing its exposure to equities from about 80 per cent last December to 30 per cent by next summer with the aim of protecting its remaining surplus from further erosion Pre-tax profits fell more than £1m to £8 67m in the year to January 31 The company paid out just under £1m on opening a store in Birmingham in September and preparing another outlet in Huddersfield which opened last month Operating profits before store opening costs rose from £9m to £9 6m on sales up 12 4 per cent at £128 4m Like-for-like sales grew 5 3 per cent The Wolverhampton-based business said trading at its Birmingham store had been affected by the planting of a car bomb in the city centre by Irish republican terrorists It failed to explode but deterred shoppers from visiting the city centre Chris Jones managing director said the business had been able to maintain margins in the face of fierce discounting by rivals The business which focuses on women's fashion had warned on profits in January Yesterday's figures were within expectations The shares fell 4p to 178{1/2}p A final dividend of 8 4p 8 35p makes a total 11 9p 11 5p payable from earnings of 15p 16 5p ,2
2002-04-20, The first overhaul of the taxation of offshore funds for nearly 20 years is being planned by Gordon Brownthe chancellor Possible reforms could have big advantages for the fund management industry and investors The Inland Revenue could usethe consultation signalled in the Budget announcements to free up restrictions on overseas funds that would make it easier for investment managers to extend their offshore fund range to UK investors Some offshore experts expect the Revenue to equalise the tax treatment of all offshore funds and remove punitive taxes on the sector This would considerably benefit both UK investors and fund management groups If the current regime were abolished it would provide a big commercial advantage to fund managers says Ed Venner senior tax manager at RSM Robson Rhodes And it could make a 20 per cent difference to an investor's tax rate The Inland Revenue is to publish a consultative document in the next few days It is asking the industry whether the tax rules on overseas funds should be retained reformed or abolished Under current rules the Revenue distinguishes between what it calls distributor and roll-up funds Revenue-approved or distributor funds have to distribute 85 per cent of fund income to investors and are restricted in their investments Funds that do not abide by these rules are taxed more harshly The tax man levies income tax on UK residents investing in so-called roll-up funds when they cash in their funds These roll-up funds do not pay out annual incomes but roll up gross income If these gains were taxed as capital gains it would give a big boost to private investors who could use their various allowances to mitigate CGT CGT-exempt bodies such as pension funds investment trusts and unit trusts would not pay tax at all on gains The existing rules were introduced in 1984 when capital gains were taxed at 30 per cent and income at more than 60 per cent Until then canny investors were investing in offshore funds that put all their money in deposit accounts earning high rates of interest This interest was allowed to roll up until investors cashed in their funds The wheeze was that the gain was taxed as capital at about 30 per cent The industry says the Revenue's accounting requirements on what is deemed distributable income is onerous and complicated Many overseas fund providers therefore do not bother to offer approved funds to investors The industry has been lobbying for changes for some time on the basis that the rules on investments and distributed income are complex restrictive and anti-competitive  Gordon Brown's decision to review rules on residence and domicile affecting foreigners living in the UK has caused an outcry in the shipping industry The chancellor's review of this tax loophole follows revelations that wealthy Labour party donors such as steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal take advantage of this special status to avoid paying taxes Brown who said he would close the loophole when in opposition follows a grand tradition of previous chancellors who have looked at changing these complex provisions Norman Lamont a former Conservative chancellor produced a consultation paper in 1988 about revising the regime that allows expatriates living in Britain to avoid paying tax on income and investments as long as their wealth is held outside the country Dennis Healey former Labour chancellor also considered changing the rules But previous attempts to reform the non-domicile status ran into so much opposition from wealthy businessmen investing in the UK that governments backed off Previous chancellors also concluded that changing the rules would not raise much tax as expatriates would change their behaviour or move elsewhere About 60000 people benefit from non-domicile status and the government estimates it loses £5bn in tax revenue as a result The Baltic Exchange the international market place for shipping cargo has warned that reforms to the system could damage their industry They fear that changes to non-domicile status could encourage Greek ship owners who form the backbone of the British shipping industry to desert London The Greek ship owners living in London provide a huge amount of business to shipping brokers insurers and lawyers in London said Jim Buckley chief executive of the Baltic Exchange ,3

1998-04-01, BMW yesterday warned it would force the temporary closure of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars if it lost control of the UK luxury car group to a rival bidder The threat underlined BMW's determination to take over Rolls-Royce as Volkswagen considered increasing its bid for the company The new offer would also include a proposal to buy the Cosworth engines business Rolls-Royce and Cosworth are both owned by Vickers the UK group Reports in Germany suggested VW would pay up to DM1 7bn $924m DM200m more than its original offer topping BMW's £340m $568m offer for Rolls-Royce Vickers said it had entered into a period of exclusive negotiations thought to be one month with BMW and could not re-open talks with others It said it remained happy with BMW's offer The sale has to be approved by shareholders Even if VW did offer more it might serve only to elicit a higher price from BMW Vickers is not going to be seduced away from BMW's safe offer by tempting proposals from VW which then prove hard to deliver said one observer Bernd Pischetsrieder BMW's chairman said his company would immediately terminate supplies of engines and other components to Rolls-Royce forcing a temporary closure If somebody wants to shoulder that responsibility then we will stop our supplies within a short period Crewe would have to close down Nobody has the ability to take it up again in such a short period he said The termination period for BMW's engine contract has been a secret The period believed to be one year would make it difficult for VW to re- engineer Rolls-Royce's new models quickly enough to avoid disrupting production Mr Pischetsrieder also outlined plans to reshape Rolls-Royce's board with the inclusion of four non-executive directors One would be an independent diplomat to help maintain Rolls-Royce's British image We should follow British traditions The company will remain British in the future It will have even less BMW about it than it does today he said Mr Pischetsrieder pledged increased investment on new models and higher output and employment We have done a lot of intellectual work in advance We have a few surprises in the future for Crewe  BMW could influence Rolls-Royce's planned replacements for its two-door models and revive the stalled project for a medium-sized Bentley range Mr Pischetsrieder's comments came as BMW said net profits last year rose 52 per cent to DM1 25bn as sales increased 15 per cent to DM60 1bn He said the strength of sterling was hurting profits at Rover which had a pre-tax loss of £92m down from £119m Walter Hasselkus Rover's chief executive said The British government does not appreciate the problems caused by the pound Manufacturing industry will take an enormous knock ,1
2002-06-05, Beware of your rights The pre-emptive right to participate in secondary capital-raising issues has been jealously guarded by UK financial institutions in recent decades But perhaps they shouldn't have bothered Research by Simon Harris of fund managers GMO Woolley found that shares in the average UK rights-issuing company steadily underperform for five years after the announcement of the issue What is even more remarkable is the uniformity of the underperformance Harris's analysis shows that it occurred in the 1960s 1970s 1980s and the 1990s However the 1980s was the worst decade remember Blue Arrow The declared reason for the rights issue also made virtually no difference Harris divided the issues into three groups those that were intended to reduce debt or shore up the balance sheet those that were specifically related to acquisitions and those that were earmarked for specific projects intended to boost organic growth It should be no surprise that the acquisition-related issues subsequently underperformed academic research has repeatedly shown that investors in acquiring companies lose out However what is surprising is that the shares of acquiring companies outperformed the other two categories of issuer For companies that use rights issues to pay down debt the offering appears merely to prolong the eventual decline By backing the issue shareholders are normally throwing good money after bad Harris found that the incidence of bankruptcy in the five years following a rights issue is some 50 per cent greater than the market average Sadly even companies that use rights issues to finance new projects underperform significantly Here Harris suggests that the problem may lie in the scale of the project which by definition cannot be funded through retained earnings Clearly the new projects fail to add the anticipated value perhaps the managers bite off more than they can chew Another danger faced by investors is that companies become frequent offenders according to Harris some 35 per cent of companies ask for more funds within four years of a rights issue All this makes quite a difference to performance Harris assembled a market-weighted portfolio consisting of frequent offenders and companies that had made a rights issue within the last 12 months Since 1970 such a portfolio would have underperformed the UK market by an average 6 8 per cent a year that underperformance was highly consistent occuring in 26 out of 32 years An index fund that simply avoided those companies that made rights issues would have beaten the market by an average 0 5 per cent a year over the last 32 years So why on earth do investors back rights issues One factor is undoubtedly prior performance Harris found that the share prices of rights issuing companies tend to outperform in the one or two years leading up to the issue this does not apply to those companies that are making rights issues to pay down debt This suggests that companies are quite efficient at playing the market they tend to issue shares when they believe their shares are fully or over-valued Investors are clearly not that efficient at spotting this Harris says that on an equally-weighted basis some 75 per cent of issuing companies underperform on a five-year basis This suggests a pretty useful rule of thumb most investors would be happy with an investment technique that paid off three times out of four But if rights issues are not worth backing this raises some serious questions about the workings of the City After all its main role in theory is to provide capital for industry If investors were entirely rational however they should refuse to subscribe to secondary offerings in most cases One has to reach the strange conclusion that UK companies only receive the finance they need because investors are not rational Indeed the academic evidence about the workings of the City paints a rather sorry picture Research also shows that new issues tend on average to underperform after the first day of trading not necessarily bad news for the institutions who get in at the issue price but definitely bad news for private investors who can only buy in the aftermarket As already mentioned most acquisitions prove disappointing for shareholders in the predator the expected synergies do not emerge Investors who trade most frequently perform less well than those who sit on their hands And finally most active fund managers fail to beat the index But will anything change It seems highly unlikely The corporate finance departments of investment banks will go on suggesting takeovers that do not work and backing capital-raising issues that do not deliver adequate returns for investors Fund managers will continue trying to beat the index although the statistics suggest that most of them will fail And everyone will get paid a lot of money for doing it Funny old world UK rights issues lessons from the past For further information contact simon_harris@gmow co uk,2
2002-06-14, The billion pound battle to buy Seeboard the south-east of England electricity supplier is turning into a three horse race TXU the US energy group and one of four short-listed bidders is now thought to be out of the running The three other bidders Electricite de France the French state owned power group Eon one of Germany's biggest utilities and Scottish and Southern of the UK expect to learn early next week which of their offers has been successful Seeboard valued at £1 3bn to £1 5bn cannot be sold by American Electric Power its US owner until Monday without falling foul of US accounting restrictions stemming from its merger last year with Central and South West AEP has appointed Schroder Salomon Smith Barney to handle the sale of Seeboard which it bought for £1 6bn in 1996 TXU was only interested in buying Seeboard's electricity supply business which has 2m customers It had proposed a joint bid with CVC the private equity company which would acquire Seeboard's local wires network It had been thought that the battle for Seeboard would be a straight fight between the larger continental European energy groups EdF and Eon which have much greater financial resources than Scottish and Southern It is a surprise that the British group should still be in the running at this late stage The French government has been criticised for failing to open its markets to full competition while EdF has been allowed to expand in other European countries but this has not prevented it from making previous British acquisitions ,1

2002-06-20, The moment at which you decide to go fundraising from the venture capital community would not be the time to be fretting about your work/life balance advises Stuart Evans chief executive of Plastic Logic The Cambridge-based company which is developing a plastic electronics technology secured £6 3m of first-round financing in April from a syndicate of venture capitalists led by Polytechnos a Munich-based firm Mr Evans began the process last September and says he spent two-thirds of his long working days on getting the funding Meanwhile Charlie Muirhead founder of network management software group Orchestream recently hauled in £10 3m for telecommunications networking company Nexagent from venture capitalists Atlas Venture and Benchmark In that case the process took about a year but it represents another funding for a company that is not yet making sales Do these two deals at least indicate that the venture capital market is stirring again even if the process is highly time-consuming Both cases are in different ways unusual But their experiences nevertheless offer useful lessons to others trying to raise venture money Overall the funding picture is still grim In the first quarter of 2002 early-stage venture funding across Europe fell by about a third compared with the final quarter of 2001 according to figures compiled by Ernst & Young and Venture One the venture capital research company The UK held up comparatively well within those figures but the scale of the contraction of venture funding in the UK is clear representing a 68 per cent fall from the first quarter of 2000 To compound matters most of the investment activity has been follow-on rather than first-stage financings as venture firms scramble to shore up sections of their existing portfolios What is more if they are investing in so-called series A financings the first institutional round they are opting for companies with customers However Nexagent does not plan to launch a commercial service until the third quarter of this year and Plastic Logic's funding is designed to take it to the point where it signs its first licensing agreements with customers at the end of 2003 So what are the tricks First the idea A few venture capitalists are still prepared to take a risk for something that could be really big Plastic Logic is a truly disruptive technology says Simon Waddington partner at Polytechnos which says it is building a balanced portfolio to include one or two ventures that while risky are potentially huge hits Nexagent is also a grand vision aiming to link data networks across multiple telecoms carriers with the simplicity and reliability of the phone network Both deals are unusual but then a large part of the process was convincing the venture capitalists of that potential to be a big idea  You need to think about fundraising as a professional relationship sales campaign If you make more calls you will make more sales says Mr Evans You also have to be properly introduced to potential investors This was one of the areas where Plastic Logic was well placed Amadeus Capital Partners the venture capital firm was a seed investor and on Plastic Logic's board is Hermann Hauser co-founder of Amadeus and a well known figure in the European high-tech community So the company was at least likely to get the right sort of introduction This in itself is a lesson says Michael Ledzion chief executive of data storage company Polight Technologies in Cambridge Later fundraisings are made easier or harder depending on who your initial investors are To the extent you have the luxury of choosing between investors you should ask yourself if they are going to be able to get you contacts at the next level Mr Ledzion says An experienced management team with previous experience in early-stage companies is more than ever a necessity in the minds of venture capitalists today I don't want to sound smug says 52-year-old Mr Evans but the reason we did well is that it is a wonderful idea it is really deep science and we have done it before  Mr Evans founded and ran Cotag International an early pioneer of electronic tagging in the mid-1980s Plastic Logic's chief scientist Richard Friend Cavendish professor of physics at the University of Cambridge co-founded Cambridge Display Technology which uses light-emitting polymer technology for computer displays Mr Muirhead is also a serial entrepreneur but the fact that he is still only in his mid 20s probably counted as a slight negative when it would have been the opposite just two years ago It did help having done it before but it only helped a bit says Mr Muirhead It meant the VCs were very happy to have the first meeting  But it was Gerry Montanus of Atlas who took the lead in the end Mr Montanus had been an investor in Orche-stream which at one time had a market capitalisation of nearly £900m before crashing back to earth in the telecommunications collapse Mr Muirhead's particular achievement at Nexagent in addition to the grand vision had been to assemble a team of seasoned executives from Cable & Wireless and Cisco The company is already looking for a chief executive with grey hair Mr Muirhead says Responsiveness is another essential quality for success in the process says Andrea Bonafe who worked on the Nexagent fundraising and is now chief operating officer of the newly merged Venture Capital Report/Pi Capital angel network You have to keep adjusting to what the venture capitalists want more focus more proof of customer interest  Flexibility in accepting some of the terms venture capitalists are now imposing is also necessary although there can still be scope for negotiation Milestones for instance have made a comeback Nexagent has tranched funding in which £4m of the £10 3 total is dependent on achieving certain milestones The VCs are trying to mitigate risk says Jason Purcell chief executive of First Stage Capital which helps companies raise venture money The devil is in the detail You need to make sure these milestones are measurable achievable and consistent with the direction in which the company is going  Other terms of the deal are also important and advisers say companies should balance the valuation they achieve against other aspects of the agreement Entrepreneurs will need to become rapidly acquainted with unfamiliar provisions such as liquidation preferences A three-times liquidation preference for instance would stipulate that an investor who puts £5m into a company receives £15m back from any sale of the business before others receive a cent A lower valuation and less onerous liquidation preferences might be considered preferable advisers say One feature of the current market is that there is still plenty of competition for the deals that are considered hot Plastic Logic for instance had half a dozen firms doing due diligence on it But in the end there are few hot deals and the whole system is in danger of getting out of balance says Richard Ord chief executive of Vulcan Machines Vulcan a Cambridge-based microprocessor company with exciting applications for Java-based technology in mobiles and set-top boxes is looking to raise a further £3m-£4m after winning funding from 3i in a competition in 2000 Mr Ord has attracted interest from smaller venture capitalists but has not made headway with the larger groups At some point the larger venture capitalists are going to need to support a decent number of really early-stage companies if not directly then through relationships with seed investors Otherwise their own deal flow will simply not be there in two years' time ,1

2002-06-17, In New York London and Tokyo investors will be holding their breath this week to see whether global equity markets can recover from Friday's sharp sell-off While Tokyo's Nikkei hit a 15-week low US and European markets saw some of their sharpest falls since the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington following a raft of negative corporate and global news One bright spot was the late-day comeback on Wall Street While European and Tokyo markets closed near their session lows US equities staged a late rally that helped the US indices recover most of the losses made earlier in the day While the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing at 9474 21 came within 30 points of breaking even the Nasdaq Composite clawed its way back to positive territory ending up 7 88 at 1504 74 We saw an emotional reaction to lots of bad news But the markets were driven to levels that were arguably very cheap said Hugh Johnson chief investment officer at First Albany Corp The most important thing next week is the stock market recovered on Friday That will encourage buying at the start of this week  But with the confessional season upon us global markets will be braced for more corporate pre-announcements which could rattle investor confidence and again undermine the markets A warning from Sprint PCS the US mobile carrier did exactly that on Friday driving the shares down more than 26 per cent to a new low of $4 40 The warning also raised doubts about VoiceStream Deutsche Telekom's US subsidiary Shares in the German operator fell below {XEU}10 on Friday and France Telecom was down almost 7 per cent to its lowest level since its shares were floated in 1997 helping to drag European markets lower David Bowers chief investment global strategist at Merrill Lynch said it was unusual for European markets to close sharply lower than the US market The two markets are very correlated but on Friday Europe crashed and the US didn't Is there something happening in Europe that we don't know about he said Mr Bowers pointed to increasing concern about the health of the European insurance sector and its ability to meet solvency requirements He added however that global markets might be oversold paving the way for buying opportunities The smart money is asking the question when to put the contrarian trade on  It has been difficult to attract investors to the equity markets amid recent scandals involving corporate accounting practices insider trading and tax evasion While corporate credibility has been one of the biggest problems for market sentiment investors may also have to worry about the strength of the US economic recovery after recent data indicated that consumer confidence was weakening The markets are acting like we're going to have a double-dip recession I don't think we will but with the consumer coming into question investors are nervous said Owen Fitzpatrick head of US equity at Deutsche Bank Private Banking The only thing that will convince investors is positive earnings results Right now we're focusing on all the negatives  Government bonds a traditional safe haven benefited from last week's sell-off in the main equity markets driving yields in the US and Europe to their lowest levels for several months The question for this week is whether the relatively high prices will temper investor demand Market week Page 38 www ft com/markets,2

1998-04-04, The National Audit Office is expected to criticise the former Conservative government for selling British Energy too cheaply when it publishes its report on the flotation of the nuclear power producer next month British Energy shares floated at 198p in July 1996 rose a further 5 per cent yesterday to 585p making the generator the top-performing FTSE stock over the past 12 months The latest rise followed the company's announcement that it was extending the lives of two of its nuclear power stations Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B by five years to 2011 The extensions would increase pre-tax profits by about £20m a year said British Energy There would also be a one-off exceptional credit of £50m in 1998-99 in respect of fuel and decommissioning provisions said the group The NAO report is expected to criticise the previous government for failing to phase the nuclear company's privatisation in line with a recommendation of the Commons public accounts committee The audit office says more money would have been raised for taxpayers if the government had retained a stake in the business This could have been sold later if the company had performed better than expected The findings are expected to echo last month's NAO report which criticised the Department of Trade and Industry for failing to phase the sale of AEA Technology the engineering business spun out from the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 1986 David Davis Tory chairman of the public accounts committee said retaining a 40 per cent stake in AEA could have generated another £110m A 40 per cent stake in British Energy sold at last night's closing price would have been worth £1bn more than at the fully paid-up issue price This valued the group at £1 4bn compared with £4bn currently British Energy's share price fell when dealings began 21 months ago as investor concerns over decommissioning costs increased after discovery of problems at two of the company's nuclear plants The problems have since been rectified and the shares have more than doubled in value in the past year They surged last month after British Energy announced pre-tax profits before exceptional items would be at least £160m for the year ending March 31 1998 some £35m-£40m higher than brokers had been forecasting Analysts said the company's improved debt position should allow it to return cash to investors possibly through a share buyback The company's value has also been boosted by hopes it will be able to extend the life of two other nuclear plants Torness and Heysham 2 by five years to 2023 ,2
2002-06-07, From Mr Paul Georgia Sir Corporate pandering to hysterical environmental campaigners simply because their antics may inflict some short-term financial harm is a myopic and ultimately destructive business strategy Activists at the gates June 5 Michael Skapinker endorses a Campaign ExxonMobil report that recommends that ExxonMobil embrace Kyoto-style global warming policies which is exactly the strategy employed by Enron before its demise In Kyoto Enron saw an opportunity to profit at the expense of its rivals and lobbied fiercely for its implementation Parroting Enron's reasoning the report says that Kyoto-style policies present an opportunity for ExxonMobil Such policies would cripple the coal industry one of ExxonMobil's main competitors In addition the company would be able to take advantage of emissions trading a mechanism through which certain companies the carbon cartel would be able to extract rents unearned wealth from other companies and the economy as a whole Last says the report ExxonMobil should not worry about the costs of Kyoto-style policies because it would be able to pass much of the cost of taxes or permits on to consumers In short it recommends that the company engage in a zero-sum game of plunder that would ultimately leave the economy in worse shape but provide a windfall for ExxonMobil This is the same game Enron was playing and we all know what happened to it Instead of focusing on building a sound company delivering a superior product to customers and finding ways to become more efficient and cut costs Enron spent its time and resources on manipulating electricity markets seeking the praise of environmentalists lavishing millions of dollars on politicians and devising strategies to beat its competitors through government regulation and sleight of hand In the long run such tactics leave the world a poorer place and that cannot be good for business Paul Georgia Environmental Policy Analyst Competitive Enterprise Institute Washington DC 20036 US,3
2002-04-01, Centrists supported by President Leonid Kuchma appeared to be headed for victory yesterday in Ukraine's parliamentary elections marred by the assassination of a candidate and allegations that local officials were planning to falsify the result An exit poll conducted by a group of independent polling agencies showed one bloc and one party in Mr Kuchma's camp entering parliament by passing the 4 per cent barrier For a United Ukraine a four-party bloc headed by the chief of Mr Kuchma's administration Volodymyr Lytvyn got 10 6 per cent in the nation-wide proportional voting while another pro-Kuchma party the Social Democrats received 7 1 per cent That would give the two parties a total of about 50 of the 225 seats being contested Election monitors expected Mr Kuchma's candidates to win 150 more seats that are being contested in direct elections in 225 local districts bringing the total size of his group to just less than a majority in the 450-seat parliament If the results confirm the exit poll predictions Ukraine would continue to have a divided parliament in which Mr Kuchma would be the dominant political force but lacking the majority he wants to consolidate power It could leave him vulnerable to impeachment if opposition parties were able to unite over corruption allegations The result would disappoint those hoping for a stronger showing by the Kuchma group's main rival the pro-western centre-right Our Ukraine bloc led by Viktor Yushchenko former prime minister Mr Yushchenko appeared to have won the contest among parties with 25 per cent of the vote according to the exit poll However his group was expected to fare worse in the district races and end up with around 100 seats The hard-left Communist party which received 20 5 per cent of the nationwide vote according to the exit poll is expected to be the third-largest group with around 80 seats The surprise result according to exit polls was the strong performance of two small opposition parties including a bloc headed by the former deputy prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko and the Socialists www ft com/europe,3
2002-06-18, Shares in Oracle the world's second-largest software company jumped 7 6 per cent in mid-day trading yesterday in advance of its fiscal fourth-quarter report late today The company is expected to report earnings per share of 12 cents against 15 cents in the corresponding period last year But it will be Oracle's forward guidance that will interest Wall Street as analysts look for signs of life in a moribund corporate information technology market We would like to see more colour on the company's revenues as we continue to be concerned with the revenues outlook going into 2003 said Christopher Shilakes analyst at Merrill Lynch Oracle shares rose 65 cents to $9 22 by lunchtime in New York As the largest supplier of database software used by most corporations for e-business Oracle's results will provide an indication of market conditions for other large software companies such as Microsoft SAP Siebel Systems and PeopleSoft However there is likely to be little good news from Oracle The company along with other software makers is suffering from a sharp slowdown in sales Most corporations around the world have reduced IT budgets this year and hopes of an IT spending rebound in the second half of the year are minimal A recent survey of corporate IT spending in the US and Europe by Merrill Lynch found that many companies had bought too many software licences last year resulting in a software glut Large lay-offs among many companies have also produced less need for additional software licences and many large IT projects have been delayed This does not bode well for Oracle which relies on licence and maintenance revenues Maintenance typically accounts for about 20 per cent of licence revenues and is directly related the number of new licences We continue to believe that this is a difficult operating environment for Oracle said Mr Shilakes Within a tough corporate software market Oracle is forced into cutting costs to meet its numbers Late last week CSFB analysts claimed that Oracle had already begun cutting jobs with the goal of reducing staff by 1-2 per cent or 400-800 people Some of these staff cuts are in its business applications group Although Oracle is mired in the global IT slowdown there are also company-specific issues that it has to deal with Its applications business has not become the growth engine the company expected two years ago And its entry into software applications business has brought it into competition with leading software application companies such as PeopleSoft and Siebel that were strong supporters of its database software Those companies have begun supporting IBM Oracle's chief rival in database software IBM dumped its applications business some two years ago and does not directly compete with application software companies Oracle is also involved in a political scandal in California which could affect its government business accounting for about 25 per cent of total revenues The state is investigating why it purchased a $95m Oracle software licence with no competing bids and with more licences than its entire workforce Oracle has denied any wrongdoing but increased scrutiny of IT purchases by California and other US states could slow future sales Wall Street is unlikely to hear much good news from Oracle on Tuesday At the Bear Stearns technology conference last week Ken Goldman chief financial officer at Siebel said the IT environment was more challenging this quarter than it was last year Other corporate software companies such as I2 Technologies have also reported similar business conditions Most analysts do not expect a rebound in corporate IT spending until next year ,2
2002-04-23, The devastating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of France's presidential elections would have been bad enough for any French prime minister To have been forced into third place by a veteran loser and extreme rightwinger 73-year-old Jean-Marie Le Pen of the National Front was the ultimate humiliation for a socialist The outcome of the poll has sent tremors not simply through the French political establishment but through the centre-left chancelleries of Europe Less than four years after social democratic parties and coalitions were in control in 13 out of 15 governments in the European Union many of those same organisations are today out of power on the defensive or in retreat In Austria Italy Denmark and Portugal they have lost power over the past two years In France the defeat of Mr Jospin on Sunday could signal another sharp shift to the right The same could happen at the general election in the Netherlands next month And in Germany Gerhard Schroder the Social Democrat chancellor is facing a ferocious struggle this autumn against Edmund Stoiber the conservative state premier of Bavaria On Sunday Mr Schroder's SPD suffered a bitter defeat at the hands of the Christian Democrats in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt Just as Mr Jospin was forced into third place by Mr Le Pen so the SPD was overtaken by the Party of Democratic Socialism PDS the former East German Communist party in the German poll It was a lousy night for the left Only in Britain does the Labour party under Tony Blair seem to be sitting comfortably with a huge majority over its Tory opponents From a European perspective the UK looks like the exception not the rule The concern among European politicians of both centre-left and centre-right is that inflammatory issues including fear of unregulated immigration and rising crime could see a rise in populist extremists such as Mr Le Pen in France Umberto Bossi in Italy and Jorg Haider in Austria The particular concern on the left is that such tendencies have coincided with an overall conservative shift among voters Several European countries have seen populist anti-immigration movements emerge in the social and political upheaval following the end of the cold war Mr Le Pen's National Front was one of the first and his hard core of about 14 per cent support in a series of French elections has remained relatively constant It has also been consistently larger than similar xenophobic votes in other EU countries His result in Sunday's poll may well not indicate a big increase in support but merely that his vote held up well in a poll with large-scale absentions Elsewhere such organisations have had mixed records In Germany the far-right DVU won almost 13 per cent of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt four years ago On Sunday it failed to field a single candidate A less extreme law-and-order party failed to win the 5 per cent needed to enter the state parliament In Denmark support for the anti-immigration Danish People's party headed by Pia Kjaersgaard rose from 7 to 12 per cent in last November's election and now ensures the survival of the minority centre-right government In the Netherlands the maverick Pim Fortuyn a gay anti-immigration candidate from Rotterdam has emerged as a challenger to the established parties in the poll due on May 15 In Italy however the out-spoken Mr Bossi who has espoused every populist issue from regional independence for Lombardy to anti-immigration and anti-European Union has seen his support drop to just 5 per cent in last year's election Relations between the far-right leaders remain cool if not positively hostile A spokesman for Mr Fortuyn yesterday described any comparison with Mr Le Pen as very insulting Ulrich Marseille the law-and-order candidate in Saxony-Anhalt said I don't want to have anything to do with Le Pen  The worrying thing for centre-left parties in the long term is less the erratic rise and fall of the far right than their own failure to consolidate their dominant position of the late 1990s First they have failed to unite the traditionally divided parties of the left That was undoubtedly an important factor in the defeat of the left in Italy by Silvio Berlusconi's conservative alliance The division between former communists and social democrats handed victory to the right The same happened in the French election where Mr Jospin faced a whole array of candidates to his left as well as Jean-Pierre Cheve`nement his former interior minister running on a left nationalist ticket In Germany the combined vote of SPD and PDS would have won in Saxony- Anhalt but alliance with the for mer communists remains unthinkable for social democrats The second failure of the left has been its inability or unwillingness to seize the political centre ground as Mr Blair's Labour party has done far more successfully Old loyalties die hard Mr Jospin was never enthusiastic about such a move When he finally adopted a centrist manifesto for the latest election it lacked all conviction Mr Schroder is more of a pragmatist but he has had to accommodate his traditional trade union allies at the expense of long overdue reforms of the German labour market and pension funds Talk of a  neue Mitte  to match Mr Blair's third way has been quietly dropped But if the left has proved incapable of capitalising on its former electoral success in the 1990s by seizing control of the centre ground it is not yet clear whether the new leaders of the centre-right can do better Instead there seems to be a paralysis of original thought In Spain Jose Maria Aznar has focused on competent government rather than radical reform Jacques Chirac forced as president to live in cohabitation with Mr Jospin's socialist govern ment sought to emphasise law and order In Italy Mr Berlusconi loves to use the old rhetoric of the left/right divide in the cold war implying all opponents left of centre are closet communists But he has stopped short of radical change in sensitive areas such as pension reform In Germany Mr Stoiber has a reputation as a traditional conservative but his economic record in Bavaria has been as interventionist as any SPD government in other states He is certainly no closet liberal on economic reform It is the popular perception of a vacuum in political debate between the traditional parties of centre-left and centre-right that seems to be stoking the rise of populist extremists That was true of Sunday's presidential poll in France The fact that both Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin positively avoided serious confrontation seemed to encourage either abstention or a protest vote for the outsiders such as Mr Le Pen That was compounded by the electoral system a protest vote in the first round scarcely seemed to matter It came as a complete surprise to most voters that one of the two front-runners might be defeated In Germany the same lack of political originality seems to affect the great people's parties of the centre the Social Democrats on the left and the Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union on the right Neither side seems to have the capacity or enthusiasm to launch the reforms urgently needed in the German economy of the labour markets and the pension system in particular Only minority parties such as the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats produce new thinking The most important lesson of the French election apart from the failure of the electoral system may well be that the traditional parties of the centre-ground have adopted the dead hand of consensus It is not that extremists are providing an attractive alternative It is that the main protagonists have simply stopped having a genuine political debate ,3
2002-04-22, Jacques Chirac last night looked set to retain the French presidency for a second term as a disgruntled electorate gave a huge protest vote to Jean-Marie Le Pen the hard-right leader of the National Front ejecting Socialist premier Lionel Jospin from the second round contest Emerging victorious from the first round Mr Chirac immediately sought to rally the nation warning of a threat to democracy should the extremist 73 year-old Mr Le Pen be elected France's next head of state Mr Jospin last night conceded defeat With 96 per cent of the vote counted he had gained 16 04 per cent behind the 17 07 per cent gained by Mr Le Pen and Mr Chirac's 19 62 per cent He also announced he would resign from the premiership and withdraw from politics once the second round vote was over on May 5 The vote was the biggest electoral upset in France's post-war political history The results are an enormous clap of thunder the fact that the extreme right represents 20 per cent is a very worrying sign for France and our democracy Mr Jospin said In addition to Mr Le Pen Bruno Megret his onetime ally in the National Front received 3 per cent of the vote The French electorate now faces a second-round choice between the 69 year-old outgoing president whose image has suffered from corruption scandals and Mr Le Pen a former paratrooper whose National Front has openly identified with racist policies and has no parliamentary representation The contest raises the prospect of a tilt towards the right in France which will further affect the political colour of Europe after the impact of the Berlusconi government in Italy What is at stake to day is national cohesion said Mr Chirac last night If an election allows rejection and dissatisfaction to be expressed this is not enough to form the basis of a government's policy  France's moderate and fragmented right is expected to rally round Mr Chirac for the second round Last night pollsters forecast a 78-22 per cent split in favour of Mr Chirac But this may not provide enough momentum for the moderate right to win a tough general election in June and without control of parliament France would face another left-right cohabitation All the ingredients are unfortunately now there to get a co- habitation said Alain Madelin the liberal leader who won less than 4 per cent but who is an important potential Chirac ally Commentators said that in the unlikely event of Mr Le Pen being elected president of France this would raise far worse problems for the European Union than those presented by the entry of the Haider faction into the Austrian government three years ago This is a big defeat for the two leaders of the establishment Mr Le Pen said last night This is first of all a rejection by the French people of the ineffective way in which they have been governed  Mr Le Pen profited from an election system which allowed 16 candidates to enter the field Mr Jospin's support was eroded by the three hard-left candidates the Communist and Green candidates and byJean-Pierre Cheve`nement his former interior minister But none of these candidates believed his presence in the second round was in doubt The vote saw an unprecedented level of abstention with 28 per cent of voters staying away from the polling booths Chirac faces co-habitation Page 2 Editorial Comment Page 16,3
2002-06-18, A bondholder group at Telewest the debt-laden cable company yesterday rebuffed the $350m £240m cash-for-bonds offer from Liberty Media the investment vehicle of John Malone the US media mogul The group claiming to comprise 11 funds holding a majority of Telewest's $3 6bn face value of bonds called for early restructuring talks with management Although the group was sceptical of Liberty Media's approach other funds could still sell enough bonds to Liberty to give it a blocking minority in any restructuring Telewest must also respond to Liberty Media's offer The bondholder group will today appoint financial advisers ahead of what is expected to be a debt-for-equity swap giving bondholders the lion's share of Telewest equity It is thought its members include funds who led restructuring at NTL the UK's biggest cable company Lawyers for the group said it was vital to ensure Liberty Media which owns 25 per cent of Telewest shares had not based its bond offer on any non-public information Liberty Media had already spent close to $200m privately buying Telewest bonds before making its public tender It made the tender for 20 per cent of Telewest bonds after a meeting last Wednesday of the Telewest board which includes three Liberty Media directors The Denver-based company said it had not warned Telewest directors of its offer and was not in possession of any subsequent material information regarding Telewest which it would be obliged to disclose The independence of Telewest's board from Liberty Media has been widely questioned however Contrary to industry guidelines only four of its 11-strong board are fully independent Liberty Media also has a voting agreement with Microsoft Telewest's second biggest shareholder and is negotiating to buy Microsoft's 23 7 per cent stake in Telewest without its attached voting rights Although Telewest has resisted criticism of its board It is understood it will set up a group led by independent directors to consider any restructuring proposals Telewest is being advised by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney and it is thought that UBS Warburg NM Rothschild and Lazard are among those pitching to advise the bondholders group Additional reporting by Juliana Ratner                             Observer Page 23,1
1998-04-04, Investcorp has assured the Office of Fair Trading that there will be no more than 350 redundancies over four years from its proposed merger of Watmoughs and British Printing Corporation amid signs that OFT will clear the deal Quebecorp the Canadian group whose rival bid for Watmoughs has already been cleared yesterday pledged it would make no redundancies among the printing company's skilled workforce But it is believed that the OFT has identified no competition problems with Investcorp's plans This would clear the way for Investcorp's much higher Watmoughs offer although the final decision would rest with Margaret Beckett the industry secretary Quebecorp has been lobbying the GPMU print union and Labour MPs some of whom fear that Investcorp would seek large job cuts from the merger Industry speculation puts the figure at 1500 from the combined workforce of 6000 Investcorp the Bahrain-based investment group has recently told the OFT that apart from 20-25 head office redundancies in London there would be no job losses above those already planned by the two companies It claims that the companies' internal plans forecast no more than 350 redundancies over the next four year with 140 in the first year Investcorp has yet to disclose these figures to the union Quebecorp yesterday sent a letter to Tony Dubbins the GPMU general secretary It said that it is our industrial plan and our intention to maintain all production capacity in the UK and to retain all of the skilled workforce We would not anticipate any redundancies among the GPMU workforce However key government members involved in merger control decisions have expressed their belief that employment issues should be left to the market and it is thought Mrs Beckett would be unlikely to be swayed by such arguments Quebecorp's best hope has been to persuade the OFT that combining Watmoughs with BPC would create serious competition problems in UK gravure printing The two companies would command at least 90 per cent of gravure capacity used for long runs of quality printing ,1
2002-04-19, The field of 16 candidates in the first round of the French presidential election this Sunday offers the biggest choice in four decades under the fifth republic and is expected to lead to an unprecedented fragmentation of the vote The latest opinion polls give the two main candidates on the right and left President Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin the prime minister less than 40 per cent of the total vote Both men have seen their support in the polls fall steadily since they started campaigning at the end of February As the campaign nears its end each is given below 20 per cent of the vote The balance has swung in favour of 69-year-old Mr Chirac's bid for a second term cut for the first time from seven years to five No incumbent president or main challenger in the fifth republic has touched such a low level of support in the first round Pollsters attribute the poor showing to the absence of a clear third candidate to challenge the dominance of the Chirac-Jospin duo which has been running the country in an awkward co-habitation since 1997 One of the main poll findings is that the public sees little difference between Mr Chirac's proposals from the right and those of Mr Jospin from the left This situation has encouraged a first-round vote from the heart giving space to candidates from the hard left to extreme right The minor candidates have also exploited first-round indifference to the two main politicians offering often attractive but unrealistic programmes Pollsters say this atmosphere has made predictions about the run-off vote on May 5 difficult The principal difference on the right is the way rival candidates have campaigned in parallel with Mr Chirac and rarely against him The exception has been Jean-Marie Le Pen's racist National Front On the left however Mr Jospin and his Socialist party have had to compete against some of the Greens and Communists who were part of the the outgoing coalition This could make it more difficult for Mr Jospin in a close-fought second round ,3
2002-04-22, At precisely 822am yesterday on a rainy spring morning in Tokyo Junichiro Koizumi donned a long-tailed jacket and left his official residence for the short journey to the Yasukuni shrine In what was claimed to be a spur-of-the-moment decision and acting in what aides termed a personal capacity Japan's prime minister repeated his controversial action of last August 13 he honoured 2 47m Japanese war dead at the country's most notorious place of worship Mr Koizumi's election as head of the Liberal Democratic party a year ago today prompted hopes abroad of a break from the old kind of Japanese politics However Yasukuni symbolises respect for Japan's past a brutal past A monument to Japan's war dead many of whom suffered terribly as a result of the disastrous imperialist experiment Yasukuni also honours 14 convicted war criminals who helped engineer the country's bid for regional domination Mr Koizumi spent about five minutes at Yasukuni in prayer and signed a register in the name Koizumi Junichiro prime minister adding to doubts about the unofficial nature of his visit He also left Y30000 £158 to pay for a wreath of flowers The visit drew a rebuke from Japan's neighbours who remain acutely aware of war-time atrocities China strongly opposes the paying of homage at Yasukuni Shrine which contains tablets of class-A war criminals by Japanese leaders in any form and at any time China's foreign ministry said yesterday The action can only hurt Japan's own image  South Korea also voiced its dismay and said it would summon Japan's ambassador to Seoul to explain the visit The two countries which will co-host the football World Cup have been trying to improve relations which suffered after Mr Koizumi's visit to the shrine last year No serving prime minister since Yasuhiro Nakasone 17 years ago has felt the need to go to Yasukuni Given the huge cost Japan has to pay in terms of its international image why does Mr Koizumi feel the need to awake the ghosts of the country's past The answer lies partly in the labyrinthine world of Japanese domestic politics The LDP used more or less to decide everything behind the scenes and the prime minister's decision-making powers were somewhat formal a bit like 'Yes Minister' says one government official referring to the television series in which civil servants make all the real decisions Mr Koizumi is seeking to be a new kind of prime minister with authority Yet for all his bravado about smashing the LDP if it blocks reform he remains beholden to the old men of the party many of whom support visits to Yasukuni Makoto Koga president of the Japan War-Bereaved Association and a former secretary-general of the LDP yesterday praised Mr Koizumi's appearance at Yasukuni as wonderful and excellent In visiting such a symbol of nationalism Mr Koizumi may be trying to tap into Japan's capacity to pull together in crisis In his own eyes Mr Koizumi has launched the country on a reformist crusade Knowing the road will not be easy it is useful to wrap his policies in the garment of a national project Much of his language such as his call to embrace the pain of economic restructuring echoes the rhetoric of hardship and sacrifice used during and after the second world war In a recent speech to the Diet Japan's parliament when Mr Koizumi spoke of his plans to rehabilitate the economy he quoted the words of the late emperor spoken shortly after Japan's surrender in 1946 Undaunted stands the pine tree in mounting snowdrifts Heed its example  That is not to say Mr Koizumi's visit was cynical He is an emotional politician who has gained support through flaunting his human qualities and frailties Rashly he promised after his election last April to visit Yasukuni When he said yesterday that he renounced war and the purpose of his visit was to sincerely mourn those who gave their lives to the country separated from their families against their will he probably meant it The irony is that Mr Koizumi's homage to the war dead may not win him great plaudits from nationalists Last year to the disappointment of hardliners he visited Yasukuni on August 13 two days before the date of Japan's official surrender This year he jumped the gun by almost four months Mr Koizumi was elected amid claims from pundits that he had a golden political touch But in visiting Yasukuni he appears to have entangled himself in an issue that antagonises all sides www ft com/asiapacific,3
2002-06-21, Dream team Pete Peterson is worried about the American dream That's one reason why the former US commerce secretary and co-founder of The Blackstone Group the private investment bank agreed to co-chair a new blue-ribbon panel aimed at cleaning up corporate America despite multiple commitments elsewhere A close friend actually asked me 'Are you a masochist by temperament or what'  Peterson told reporters yesterday at the launch of the Conference Board's grandly titled commission on public trust and private enterprise But the former chairman and chief executive of Lehman Brothers now in his 70s said his background as a successful son of Greek immigrants had made him particularly sensitive to anything that threatened to tarnish the American dream Indeed in 1993 he wrote a book subtitled How to Rescue the Economy from Crushing Debt and Restore the American Dream Peterson has plenty of other qualifications to spearhead the latest effort to restore confidence in the American corporation perhaps the most important of which is that he is a friend of fellow Nebraskan Warren Buffett The sage of Omaha is not actually on the Conference Board panel although other outspoken luminaries such as Arthur Levitt former SEC chief and Paul Volcker former Fed chairman are But judging from the number of times Peterson mentioned his name yesterday Buffett whose conviction that stock option costs should be deducted from profits has riled many chief executives will be a considerable influence on the commission ,3
2002-06-21, Reuters was left reeling yesterday after what some analysts interpreted as a veiled profits warning sent the shares spinning to a near nine-year low The near 14 per cent slide took the share price down 56 to a closing level of 347{1/2}p The intensity of the unhappiness surrounding the news and financial information group was also reflected in the turnover which at just under 50m shares was four times the daily average A comments by the chief executive that profit margins next year would be beyond 12 per cent was taken as a signal that they would be well below the 14 per cent factored into many forecasts Taken though to the bottom line it implied a fall of at least 10 per cent in operating profits Numis Securities slashed its 2003 pre-tax profit forecast by £130m to £565m to reflect the pressure on revenues and margins And one analysts pointed out that with exposure to the banking industry where companies were cutting staff and cutting back on dealing screens to the media sector which has been crucified by tumbling advertising revenues and the technology sector which is still being punished for the dotcom boom Reuters was the quintessential stock in a bear market News that Reuters was also cutting a further 650 jobs mainly senior and middle managers to save around £100m a year and speeding up its business transformation drive was seen as a desperate attempt to shore up sliding revenues By the end of the session the stock was trading at a 15 per cent discount to the sector at around 20 times 2003 earnings The fall left Reuters the weakest performer in the FTSE 100 as it led the media sector lower Granada was off 6{1/2} at 105p and WPP 27 at 595p while United Business Media fell 30 to 440p Unhappy Abbey Abbey National continued to wallow in misfortune

Oftel the regulator outlined measures to open the company's near monopoly on fixed line calls ahead of a full liberalisation of the marketplace The shares dropped 8{1/4} to 250p with nearly 70m changing hands after Oftel said it was forcing BT to offer fixed line connections to its rivals at the same price paid by its own retail operations Meanwhile Vodafone hit a new milestone as the shares closed under 90p for the first time since early 1998 The fall of 3{1/2} to 89p on turnover of 425m shares came on the back of investor irritation at Sir Christopher Gent's options package There was also a Europe-wide sell-off in telecoms reflecting a lack of excitement from the latest statement by Nokia of Finland and renewed speculation that France Telecom was about to launch a rights issue following the heavy stake sale in the French group by Deutsche Telekom on Wednesday Scottish Power recovered as the market responded to the utility company's dismissal rumours of accounting problems which sent the stock plunging late on Wednesday ABN Amro reiterated its buy stance saying it had checked the accounts and found no discrepancies Also Pacificorp Scottish Power's US unit was not one of

North Sea Buzzard field's appraisal programme indicated oil reserves in the area might be bigger than estimated BG said the recoverable reserves in the field had a significant upside potential with estimate remaining in excess of 400m barrels In summer 2001 the field's operator Encana pegged the estimate to be between 200m and 300m barrels However subsequent appraisal drillings showed that Buzzard could contain more than 400m barrels The shares closed 6 lower at 283p HSBC slides Banking stocks fell again and not even an upgrade by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein could prevent HSBC sliding 16{1/2} to 750p The broker moved HSBC to hold from reduce and increased the target price to 825p from 700p saying an improving cost outlook combined with strong sales of banc assurance products would help offset the weakness of credit expansion in Hong Kong On the other hand Dresdner downgraded Standard Chartered to reduce from hold and cut the target price to 700p from 775p because of the bank's exposure to Hong Kong bankruptcies The shares fell 10{1/2} to 701{1/2}p Insurers CGNU Prudential and Legal & General were affected by cuts to fair value estimates by CSFB The fall in the FTSE 100 meant the ongoing decline in equity valuations also put pressure on insurance issues particularly given the relevance of solvency issues ahead of the publication of the government-instigated

2002-06-03, Surgutneftegaz one of Russia's largest oil companies is planning an international stock market listing as early as next year as part of a radical change in management strategy designed to increase its appeal to foreign investors The company will seek independent board directors in time for its annual general meeting next year launch a code of corporate governance in the first half of 2003 and introduce stock option schemes for executives and managers later this year It is also set to upgrade to the highest or level 3 grade of American Depositary Receipts once it has made a transition to quarterly financial reporting which advisers said should be by the second half of 2003 The moves represent a revolution at Surgutneftegaz which has long been seen as the laggard among Russian oil companies while its rivals have taken considerably greater steps to cultivate outside investors and boost their market capitalisation in the past two years The company had been penalised by the capital markets in the past relative to the rest of the Russian oil sector said one adviser to the company yesterday despite probably being the most honest  The company has long resisted pressures for greater transparency and investor-friendly policies but said on Friday it intended to comply with high international standards of corporate governance and clarity After investor pressure the company released its financial results for 1999 and 2000 in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and promised 2001 figures by the autumn Net income in 2000 was $2bn on revenues of $5 8bn ,2
2002-04-15, Northrop Grumman the defence contractor last night raised its hostile offer for TRW to $6 7bn to put pressure on the automotive and defence group to open talks Northrop is offering stock worth $53 per TRW share an increase of almost 13 per cent over its previous bid of $47 and above TRW's Friday closing price of $51 97 However Northrop insists that it be allowed to perform due diligence on TRW's books before completing a deal The offer comes just a week before TRW shareholders are due to vote on Northrop's offer at a special meeting TRW's board rejected the previous proposals in favour of a plan to break up the company by selling its aeronautical systems division and spinning off its automotive parts division Northrop also plans to spin off the automotive business Kent Kresa Northrop's chairman and chief executive said We strongly encourage TRW shareholders to send a strong message to their board of directors in favour of inviting us to conduct due diligence  Northrop justified the increase by pointing to improving economic conditions for TRW's end markets and the positive outlook for the US defence industry The offer also takes advantage of the buoyancy in Northrop's share price Northrop's shares fell sharply in mid-February when the company announced its offer for TRW as investors worried about taking on another large acquisition while integrating previous deals However the shares have rebounded and closed on Friday at $118 03 near a four-year high Northrop has also changed the conditions that ensure its offer is fixed in value Under the revised terms TRW shareholders will receive $53 per share in Northrop stock as long as the bidder's share price remains above $113 and stays below $123 ,2
2002-06-11, Telecommunications com-panies cutting spending on infrastructure contributed to a 30 per cent fall in pre-tax profits at Acal which distributes telecoms equipment and information technology parts Pre-tax profits fell from £20 1m to £14m in the year to March 31 Turnover was £297m £325 3m John Curry chairman said the electronic components division had been hurt by companies such as Lucent and Nokia reducing spending on telecoms infrastructure We are at the forefront of technology At the time when infrastructure stops being built it impacts on us  Sales in the electronic components division fell from £153 1m to £115 2m while earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation halved from £13m to £6 4m However this was partly offset by growth in the IT parts services division which provides spares and logistics for computers It lifted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation from £2 5m to £3 1m on sales up from £38m to £47 3m Growth was also driven by more companies outsourcing their spare parts requirements Acal had taken measures to cut overheads Mr Curry said There were indications that the worst of the downturn was over but this was unlikely to be reflected in the first half of this financial year A final dividend of 12 2p makes a total of 18 3p 16 5p payable from earnings per share of 32 4p 47 3p Comment  Acal's IT parts services business is a useful counter-cyclical operation but the heart of the group remains exposed to the fortunes of the telecoms and IT sectors The shares have almost doubled since September from a low of 327{1/2}p to yesterday's close of 589p down 3{1/2}p ABN Amro the broker is forecasting profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of £17 5m putting the shares on a p/e of 14 a significant discount to the support services sector Acal is confident of a cyclical upturn if not at the end of this year then next Others however see little prospect of a swift recovery in the telecoms and IT sectors Mr Curry has an uphill task to convince investors to share his optimism in the short term ,2
2002-04-13, The highlight thus far of Germany's election campaign came yesterday when a Hamburg court met to rule on an attempt by the chancellor to prevent a little-known news agency repeating remarks suggesting he dyes his hair The court was besieged by reporters and television crews hoping for a glimpse of the chancellor He declined to show but lawyers from both sides emerged from the private hearings to brief the media Mr Schroder's hair crisis has become a staple for comedians and television chat shows Interest mushroomed after reports that the chancellor might have to provide a sample for testing by the court The unfortunate analogy that many Germans drew was with football coach Christoph Daum who had to provide a strand of hair to clear his name of cocaine addiction but then did not take up the job of head of the national team Mr Schroder is not the first world leader to allow his hair to dominate the political agenda Five years ago the question of whether Tony Blair had flattened his bouffant style to appeal to female voters raised eyebrows Bill Clinton was criticised in 1993 when Air Force One was delayed for a cut and blow-dry from Christophe of Beverley Hills requiring the closure of Los Angeles airport With Mr Schroder and Edmund Stoiber his silver-haired conservative rival competing for the centre ground in what will be a close fight looks and image are expected to count more than ever Mr Stoiber a trim 60 is playing partly on his age and experience to underline his reputation for economic competence But Mr Schroder at 58 is again trying to present himself as brimming with energy and ready for action That image does much to explain why speculation about his hair is so topical At the previous election in 1998 questions about his appearance cropped up regularly The dye dispute arose after the ddp news agency quoted Sabine Schwind von Egelstein a Bavarian image consultant as saying It would make him more convincing if he didn't dye his grey temples  Although the agency withdrew the report Mr Schroder applied for a restraining injunction to prevent its being repeated Yesterday the agency's lawyers said that would prevent legitimate debate and threatened to go to Germany's highest tribunal Udo Walz the hairdresser who cuts the chancellor's hair once a month revealed little yesterday If this is our biggest problem it seems to me everything is going pretty well in Germany he said Postwar Germany has prided itself on the sobriety of its politics and politicians' private lives remain largely taboo In spite of the popular interest in Mr Schroder's hair the issue has not really been exploited by his political opponents But vanity among its politicians is nothing new People used to talk about the price of Walter Scheel's suits and the cost of his crocodile shoes recalled the deputy head of a personality magazine In the end the former foreign minister and federal president had to issue regular denials What's changed in Germany isn't so much politicians' vanity as the level of media interest as we've moved more towards US-style personality journalism  The trend shows no sign of abating I hope that after the court has given its decision this issue will be concluded said Uwe-Karsten Heye government spokesman It was not to be Contrary to expectations the Hamburg judges postponed their verdict and will keep everyone guessing until May 17 It could be a close shave www ft com/germany2002,3
2002-06-12, In a humiliating climbdown Tony Blair yesterday abandoned his complaint to the Press Complaints Commission over reports that he tried to muscle-in on the Queen Mother's funeral Downing Street continued to insist that there was no effort to secure the prime minister a more prominent role at the funeral But the Spectator London's Evening Standard and the Mail on Sunday said the decision to drop the complaint proved that their articles were accurate all along They have now moved their tanks into reverse in the most hilarious way said Boris Johnson editor of the Spectator and a Conservative MP This is a very important victory for press freedom said Peter Wright editor of the Mail on Sunday An outrageous attempt by Downing Street to use the Press Complaints Commission to force the media to accept Number 10's interpretation of political news has been thwarted  Mr Blair went to the PCC in April after the three publications refused to publish corrections as demanded At the time his spokesman said We are forced to take this course The story is untrue and the prime minister is determined they should correct it and apologise  There were no corrections and no apologies yesterday Instead Downing Street published an exchange of letters with the PCC The PCC said all the parties are agreed on the fact that there were contacts between Number 10 civil servants and Black Rod's office    Where the dispute arises is over the interpretation of these contacts  It noted that none of the three publications concerned has produced evidence in their defence that the prime minister himself was in any way involved in any of this Alastair Campbell Mr Blair's director of communications replied saying The prime minister is content with your clear view that he was in no way involved  The PCC declared the matter closed The newspapers accused the PCC of arranging a face-saving way for Mr Blair to extricate himself from a case he was bound to lose Mr Johnson said Mr Blair had to take responsibility for the activities of senior officials acting in his name Mr Blair's spokesman said he did not accept that the officials had done anything other than try to clarify the prime minister's part in the funeral In a statement last night Sir Michael Willcocks Black Rod said he was approached by the PCC and asked if he would comment since his own role in the matter had been raised The statement said Black Rod discussed the request with the PCC but in the event Number 10 withdrew its complaint and therefore as far as Black Rod is concerned the matter is now closed ,3
1998-04-02, As the British pound passes another nine-year record against the D-Mark the cries of pain from the manufacturing sector have become more strident This week Adair Turner director-general of the Confederation of British Industry called upon the Bank of England to signal that UK interest rates had reached their peak and so help to push sterling back to a more realistic level On the same day the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce's latest survey showed that manufacturers were losing sales at home and abroad And yesterday the March survey of purchasing managers confirmed a sharp fall in export orders This is hardly surprising with sterling now almost 32 per cent above its level at the end of 1995 even though the competitiveness of UK manufacturers has greatly improved During the 1970s and 1980s Britain's exports grew consistently less fast than world trade But since 1992 they have held their share of an increasing market and did better than expected last year because of technical improvements and tighter control of wage costs That manufacturers are better armoured against the assaults of a strong pound may be a small comfort in the embattled Midlands and the north west Nevertheless in the new world of long-term fiscal and inflation targets there is no escape Even in the monetarist phase of Margaret Thatcher's government manufacturers knew that the authorities could try to do something about the exchange rate if they wanted That era ended last May when the Bank of England took charge of interest rates with a duty to control inflation But although the Bank is not able also to manage the exchange rate it cannot ignore it If the price of a credible anti-inflation strategy is loss of jobs in the Midlands it must be paid But the price must be minimised There are two way in which this could be done first by tightening fiscal policy and second by ensuring that monetary policy does not straggle indecisively behind the need for action The Treasury pointed out this week that it has tightened fiscal policy by about 2 per cent of gross domestic product on a cyclically adjusted basis in recent Budgets This is probably as much as was politically feasible The Bank's monetary policy committee on the other hand may prove to have raised interest rates too little and too late A sharper rise a year ago would have put it in a better position now to accede to the CBI's request This year the committee has seemed indecisive and divided in the face of continued inflationary pressures At its meeting next week it must show that it is made of sterner stuff Rates may need to go higher still but the currency markets probably expect this anyway Waiting may only make the symptoms worse ,2
2002-06-12, When Enron collapsed Global Crossing went bankrupt and WorldCom's bonds halved in value in a matter of weeks bond investors were left reeling shocked by the speed at which the companies' creditworthiness had deteriorated Suddenly it was clear the credit analysis they had been using was an insufficient indicator of which companies were most at risk of defaulting on their debt Credit analysts have traditionally spent their time examining corporate financial data and meeting company executives when assessing creditworthiness Ratings agencies have emphasised long-term analysis believing it important to look through economic cycles But in recent years the credit markets have become much more volatile amid the emergence of new products such as credit derivatives and new players such as hedge funds Gone is the old buy-and-hold mentality of institutional investors that once dominated trading activity in fixed income The credit markets are now far more dynamic says Vincent Matsui managing director Credit Solutions at Swiss Re Enron's demise brought the credit ratings process under new scrutiny prompting the ratings agencies to reassess the way they analysed companies Criticised for being too slow to downgrade Enron Moody's suggested several changes to its ratings process earlier this year including making more frequent changes and eliminating outlooks The changes were opposed by investors who were worried about an increase in ratings volatility Nevertheless the agencies have been paying more attention to how debt is traded in the fixed-income markets developing market-based tools to assess a company's risk of default In February Moody's signalled the importance of these tools by acquiring KMV a provider of market-based credit risk products Credit risk is on the threshold of a major transformation according to Steve Kealhofer managing director of research at Moody's KMV The increase in the volume of credit trad ing of all types means that we are moving towards a mark-to-market world in credit Mr Kealhofer says This is already changing the views of credit risk within large institutions and redefining their portfolio management of credit risk  Moody's KMV has seen its clients more than double in number over the past two years to just over 200 at the end of April The business is is expected to bring in as much as $200m in revenues by 2005 one-quarter of Moody's current annual revenues of $797m Standard & Poors also has a Risk Solutions group with a variety of credit risk products that it expects to expand in the years ahead The banks too have been responding to growing demand for new tools that can provide some early warning of credit problems RiskMetrics a former division of JP Morgan that was spun off in 1998 recently developed CreditGrades a market-based risk assessment model endorsed by JP Morgan Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs The free website is designed to provide timely indication when a firm's credit becomes impaired It is expected to be used as a hedging tool as well as a source of analysis for how both the credit and equity markets would respond to major changes in a company's capital structure We've never been more sensitised to credit says David Covin vice-president of credit derivatives at Goldman Sachs People want to be attuned to where the next crisis might emerge  The website launched last month has received 1000 hits a day Corporate strategists stress that market-based credit analysis has its limitations Volatility in the equity markets can be interpreted as negative for credit risk by some risk models which can cause lower debt prices and lead to a ratings downgrade points out Louise Purtle head of US credit strategy at CreditSights The more that people use these tools the more people need to use them because you don't want to be the one not to know what's going to happen to a company Ms Purtle says Investors say quantitative analysis does not replace traditional credit analysis but it is a welcome addition Anything that improves transparency of information is a good thing for an investment manager says Richard Libby market risk manager in the global credit group of Barclays Global ,2
2002-06-06, The Chicago Mercantile Exchange one of two futures exchanges in the city quietly celebrated a birthday recently Esteemed guests included William McDonough the influential president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and kind words were sent from Alan Greenspan Fed chairman All heaped praise upon the CME and particularly its former chairman Leo Melamed for the 30th anniversary of his move to begin trading futures on financial instruments instead of just commodities The CME with Mr Melamed at the helm opened the International Money Market IMM on May 16 1972 to trade currency futures The Chicago Board of Trade followed soon after creating the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1973 and launching futures on the US Treasury bond in 1977 which until recently had been the world's most traded contract Milton Friedman the 1976 Nobel prize winner in economics relayed a story at the luncheon on just how far the Chicago exchanges had taken the world They also had changed themselves from sleepy but steady commodities pits into international financial hubs he said The IMM's reception by the financial market was anything but enthusiastic this was a crazy idea by those people out in Chicago Mr Friedman said at the occasion On the day the IMM opened for business one New York bank foreign exchange dealer was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying 'I am amazed that a bunch of crapshooters in pork bellies had the temerity to think that they can beat some of the world's most sophisticated traders at their own game ' That bunch of crapshooters went from one success to another first trading currencies then introducing contracts in interest rates and stock prices and so on until you have the variety of financial futures that you have today Mr Friedman said The gathering in essence reflected how Chicago exchanges became the top derivatives exchanges But the retrospective anniversary also had a sense of glories past like an ageing athlete revisiting their greatest victories The world has caught up to Chicago in many respects and in some others the competition threatens to leave it behind The CBOT was once the busiest futures exchange in the world but has since ceded that title to the German-Swiss Eurex exchange and fallen below its crosstown rival the Chicago Metal Exchange But more importantly all three Chicago exchanges no longer seem like the crapshooters Mr Friedman described They are the old guard now seen doing things the old way European derivatives exchanges have closed their trading pits and shifted all their trading to electronic trading systems which allow for cheaper trades Consolidation is close to completion in Europe and many have become profitable companies with share issues Those Chicago exchanges are museums said one European derivatives exchange official recently The Chicago exchanges have moved in the same direction as their European counterparts but at nowhere near the pace They have seen their trading members vehemently guard their open-outcry pit trading But they have defensively moved into electronic computer screen-based trading which has now started to show significant inroads In addition the futures exchanges have moved to switch their corporate structure from member-controlled co-operatives to streamlined public companies that can react quicker The liquidity of their markets continue to attract massive volumes Although all-electronic challengers continue to nibble intense stock market and interest rate volatility in recent years have kept customers coming back The CME's volume in April this year has risen 32 per cent over last year to 164 2m contracts helped by recent Fed rate changes prompting record volume in its short-term interest rate Eurodollar futures Trading on its Globex electronic system which includes its successful small S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts is almost double that of last year The CBOT's volume this year has increased 15 per cent to 95m contracts More important is the migration of its US bond trading to the a/c/e electronic trading venture between it and Eurex despite an ongoing stalemate in talks to re-work their relationship The percentage of benchmark 10-year Treasury notes trading online is up to 56 per cent of total volume in the contract from 27 per cent this time last year The CBOE the world's largest options exchange has seen the biggest effect from electronic competition chiefly the International Securities Exchange CBOE volume fell 26 per cent in April In last year's fourth quarter its market share fell almost three points from the previous year to 38 3 per cent while the ISE's rose 10 points to 12 5 per cent to become the third largest US options exchange The two Chicago futures exchanges have also steadily moved to streamline their governance and organisational structure known as demutualisation into companies designed to make a profit The CME is furthest along the track It has operated as a profit-making company for more than a year slashing its board of directors committees and costs while rankling customers with fee increases Early in May the CME said it would move ahead with an initial public offering by the end of 2002 The decision to do an IPO came within a week after a dramatic shake-up Long-time incumbent Scott Gordon lost a re-election bid to a 43-year-old cattle trader Terrence Duffy Mr Duffy won because members were concerned that Mr Gordon had lost touch with their interests in revamping the exchange Mr Duffy was seen to make the quick IPO announcement to quash any fears that he was against the structural changes Mr Duffy also quickly spoke out in favour of the need for consolidation among futures exchanges including the Chicago exchanges or with smaller commodity exchanges in Kansas City and Minneapolis The three Chicago exchanges have moved closer together for what they do best new product innovation Although the idea of joining the Chicago exchanges has been discussed fruitlessly for decades the CBOE CBOT and CME banded together last year to form OneChicago to trade futures on individual company stocks So-called single stock futures had been illegal for almost 20 years Now OneChicago awaits the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to polish off trading and margin rules which will allow trading to begin James Newsome CFTC chairman said the resolution of the final issue regarding margins for single stock futures is very very close Launch of the futures is expected in June A significant barrier could be if the margin rule treats single stock futures in the same way as equity options which would mean futures trading houses would have to reprogramme their margin and settlement systems The success of single stock futures kind of part futures contract and part option could almost overnight connect the three Chicago derivatives exchanges more closely than they ever have been But trading interest in such a product is still very unclear However it shows that the Chicago exchanges still have innovation and some risk-taking in their blood as they fight off what they once were crapshooters ,2
2002-06-12, A move by Commerzbank German publisher WAZ Gruppe and Columbia TriStar the US film studio of Japan's Sony to bid jointly for Kirch Gruppe's free-TV and rights assets seemed to have hit delays yesterday Separately the last two divisions of the Kirch media empire not to have filed for insolvency were expected to seek court protection from creditors today People close to Kirch said Taurus Holding the group's holding company and Kirch Beteiligung the investment arm that holds Kirch's stakes in publisher Axel Springer and in Formula One were likely to file for insolvency at a Munich court today Meanwhile Commerzbank was expected to make a decision on its planned consortium yesterday but the bank said it could not comment on the outcome of the meeting WAZ could only confirm that talks were continuing The three partners are said to be still locked in negotiations about which of them would take management control of a re-launched KirchMedia Kirch's core free-TV and rights business which filed for insolvency in April and is now being auctioned off It emerged yesterday that Commerzbank's London-based investment bankers had been in contact with other interested parties in France and Italy raising questions about its commitment to the consortium Several large international media groups such as AOL Time Warner and Viacom have sought to enlist German partners to bid for KirchMedia Potential bidders in France and Italy include Lagarde`re TF1 and Mediaset which already has a stake in KirchMedia Commerzbank which is also a large creditor to KirchMedia would have a head start over other bidders because of its knowledge of the business and its access to KirchMedia's creditors' meetings But the bank has tried to keep a low profile on the issue in the past few days It abruptly withdrew an offer to buy Kirch's 40 per cent stake in Axel Springer last month Meanwhile UBS Warburg which was mandated by KirchMedia to auction its assets was yesterday said to have received 82 expressions of interest for the businesses which include a 52 5 per cent stake in ProSiebenSAT 1 Germany's largest television broadcasters  Kirch Gruppe's unprofitable pay-TV venture is to receive a {XEU}100m $94m bridging loan from creditors The loan will ensure operations will continue until investors are found ,1
2002-06-03, City economists expect the Bank of England's monetary policy committee this week to leave interest rates unchanged at their lowest levels in more than a generation But most analysts think the cost of borrowing is set to rise soon after The MPC is likely to be goaded into raising its benchmark rate above 4 per cent over the coming months by the continuing rise in house prices and families' persistent willingness to take on debt to finance their shopping and homebuying Borrowers have reason to thank disappointing official numbers that suggest the economy stopped growing for six months at the end of last year and the beginning of this year Domestic demand continued to grow but exports kept falling depressing the manufacturing sector further The official data pose a dilemma for the committee which ends its monthly rate-setting meeting on Thursday Recent surveys suggest that economic growth has returned with a vengeance in the current quarter BDO Stoy Hayward's latest poll of polls a weighted average of recent business surveys used as a leading indicator for the economy points to healthy growth in the second half of the year But the MPC may be reluctant to raise the cost of borrowing reining in future economic growth until the government's statisticians have confirmed that the economy is growing MPC members are likely to be even more sensitive to accusations that they err on the side of hawkishness when setting rates following recent criticism by Sushil Wadhwani the arch-dove who retired from the committee on Friday Mr Wadhwani told the Financial Times last week that the Bank's independence could be at risk if it continued to undershoot its target for inflation Underlying inflation has been below the government's 2 5 per cent target for 35 of the past 37 months But few economists be-lieve that moderate rises in interest rates are likely to stall the gathering economic recovery Moreover keeping rates low has encouraged households to pile up more debt much of it used to keep pace with the rise in house prices The annual rate of house price inflation reached a 13-year high of 17 9 per cent last month according to Nationwide Britain's biggest building society Even a quarter-point rise in rates would send an effective signal to Britons to ease up on borrowing Many analysts expect the MPC to raise rates in early July as it becomes increasingly evident that the world economy is recovering and pulling Britain along with it ,2
1998-04-02, Four of the UK's largest public transport operators are understood to have joined the bidding for MTL the Merseyside bus and train company put up for sale in February after shelving its plans to float on the Stock Exchange The company which set a deadline of last week for indicative offers is believed to have received proposals from Stagecoach FirstGroup Arriva and Go-Ahead MTL is evaluating the bids with its advisers SBC Warburg and KPMG and a deal is not expected before the end of this month Stagecoach and Go-Ahead are both thought to have made offers to buy the entire company for about £100m However MTL is also understood to be looking at proposals that would involve selling the business in parts FirstGroup is thought to be interested only in acquiring MTL's London bus operation Arriva is also believed to be looking at buying just parts of the business MTL is said to be open-minded about whether to sell the business as a whole or to break it up Peter Coombes chairman is determined to realise the maximum value for MTL's 2500 employee shareholders and is reported to be prepared to withdraw the business from sale unless a high offer is received Analysts had pencilled in a flotation value of about £150m But this would have involved the company having to raise fresh capital to repay its £40m of debt However even after adjusting for the debt the indicative bids received are still lower than the value expected for the company had it floated MTL shelved its flotation plans in February blaming uncertainties surrounding a year-long inquiry by the Office of Fair Trading into bus companies in the Merseyside area But it admitted that its decision had also been influenced by a wave of one-day strikes at its Mersey Electrics rail arm over pay and working practices MTL has annual turnover of about £500m It operates bus services in Liverpool and London as well as the Mersey Electrics and the Regional Railways North East franchises The company was bought by its employees in 1992 from the local authority Interest in a sale increased last December with the expiry of a clawback provision in the buy-out agreement This obliged shareholders to hand back 40 per cent of the proceeds to the local authority ,1
2002-06-20, Sir Christopher Gent chief executive of Vodafone and the phrase pay dispute seem to be permanently yoked together but the degree of controversy looks like rising strongly over the next few weeks as shareholders prepare to vote on Vodafone's new remuneration package The first requirement in addressing the issue is to keep a cool head three separate controversies are contained in the annual report's section on executive pay and they need to be clearly distinguished Controversy One is over a special payment of £10m that the company agreed to pay Sir Christopher for taking over Mannesmann Half was to be in shares which would vest two years later provided certain targets were met which they now have Shareholders rightly objected at the time that to pay an executive for merely doing a deal of unproven merit set a terrible example And given Vodafone's tumbling share price some think he should not get the second tranche worth about £1 5m at current prices But Sir Christopher is legally entitled to the shares and while he might have found it politic to refuse them as a gesture of pain-sharing there is little point in shareholders fighting this particular battle all over again Controversy Two is the amount of pay Sir Christopher received in the year to the end of March when the company recorded a £13 5bn loss the biggest in corporate history after £20bn of writedowns and the share price dropped by a third from 193p to 130p Sir Christopher by a neat coincidence got a 33 per cent rise his basic pay of £1 2m was doubled to £2 4m by short-term bonus incentives And on top of that he also got £844000 of shares for long-term performance and options over 9m shares albeit valueless at current share prices In Vodafone's defence the group's free cash flow was strong during the year and it is unwise to link pay packages directly to short-term share price movements which may reflect the vagaries of the market But the disparity between investors' suffering and Sir Christopher's rewards are so stark as to suggest the performance criteria for its short-term incentive plan based on earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation were not tough or broad enough The company seems belatedly to recognise this the criteria for this year have been broadened to include growth in free cash flow and average revenue per mobile phone user Controversy Three is the new overall pay policy the company unveiled yesterday in response to criticism that its old one was too opaque This is the issue investors should really be focusing on for Vodafone has consulted with the City over the past year and if shareholders approve it in an advisory vote at the annual meeting it is likely to serve as a yardstick for other companies This then could be an important juncture in UK executive pay policy City governance experts were yesterday reluctant to pass immediate judgment given the scheme's complexity The general principles espoused by the company certainly chime with accepted best practice including having a high proportion of pay based on performance and most of that element in equities But the devil is in the detail A key issue is the size of Sir Christopher's overall package A welcome move is the company's decision to benchmark against other leading European companies and not include US ones where remuneration is much higher as it did in the past The company is vague on the precise amount he might get saying pay at the peer group ranges from £3 4m to £9 3m But since his basic pay is supposed to make up some 20 per cent of the package the implication seems to be that he could make up to £6m a year if all performance targets are met That is certainly a great deal in a UK context Lord Browne of BP got a mere £3m last year so Vodafone is hardly reining back the pay trend The crucial question is how demanding are the long-term performance targets that would trigger this bounty The answer seems to be fairly but not as much as they they might Shares potentially worth up to one and three quarters of Sir Christopher's basic pay this year will be awarded by comparing Vodafone's long term total shareholder return with rival telecommunications companies That is good and the maximum payout will only be made if the company is in the top 20 per cent But half the award will still be due for average performance There can be similar quibbles about a plan that could give him options with a face value of seven times salary this year This then is a package that makes significant improvements in the clarity and performance elements of Vodafone's old rewards system But it also says bluntly to the City We are one of Europe's biggest and most successful companies whatever the stock market says and our executives deserve to be paid as well as their peers if they perform Given that the company estimates Sir Christopher would gain just £4m for a 50 per cent vesting of long term incentives and an increase of £50bn in the value of the business investors may reluctantly conclude it is a price worth paying Martin Dickson@ft com,2
2002-06-24, Fears of an increasingly bitter battle over the terms of European Union enlargement yesterday cast a shadow over the European summit in Seville which ended with a hard-fought compromise plan to tackle illegal immigration The 15 EU leaders committed themselves to taking in up to 10 new countries in 2004 but German reservations over costs came to the fore Gerhard Schroder German chancellor said the final financial package for the 10 might not be ready until December in spite of a summit declaration that details should be available in early November Germany is stalling because it has serious reservations about the cost of EU farm subsidies while Jacques Chirac French president is ready for a fight to maintain generous payments to French farmers With final negotiations due to be concluded at the Copenhagen summit in mid-December the prospect is raised of fraught last-minute debates about financing enlargement The sense of foreboding was heightened by demands from Turkey for a firm date to start talks about joining the EU at the Copenhagen summit a move opposed by Germany and others On immigration the leaders agreed to more co-operation on strengthening EU borders putting in place new measures this year to return illegal immigrants to their country of origin and to implement a common asylum policy by the end of 2003 They also agreed to continue discussions about creating a European border police force But Spain Britain and Italy failed to push through a proposal to sanction those countries that did not crack down on illegal immigration to the EU Under pressure from Sweden and France there was no mention of possible sanctions Mr Chirac said We are not going to solve the problem by brandishing a sword especially not a wooden one  The leaders also agreed that future summits should be more focused and last only one day with contentious issues discussed in advance in a new fix it sub-committee Blow to Blair Page 3 Turkey seeks talks date Page 6 Editorial Comment Page 22 The immigration muddle and Observer Page 23 www ft com/seville,3
2002-06-19, Jefferson Smurfit Paper stone and scissors The playground game requires all three to work Jefferson Smurfit had the first two but failed to cut out a pattern of shareholder value Now Madison Dearborn has provided the cutting edge with its offer of {XEU}3 16 a share in cash and Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation paper This is a premium of 38 per cent to the share price before the approach It puts an enterprise value of six times 2001 earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation on the Irish packaging group in line with other recent deals Some analysts were looking for a further 25 cents a share but Smurfit had to take account of the realities The biggest of these was its 29 5 per cent stake in Stone the US market leader in containerboard This holding gave Smurfit its breakthrough in the US and pricing leverage in a notoriously cyclical market But the volume of debt taken on meant that Stone was unable to pay dividends to its Irish parent Buying the rest of Stone would have been too expensive but giving the stake to Smurfit shareholders would have left Smurfit more than 80 per cent geared The company insists that overall Smurfit benefited from the original Stone deal But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Michael Smurfit chairman and consummate deal-maker saved the industry at the expense of his own shareholders The possibility of a counter-bid has emerged but neither the timing nor the Smurfit share price support this It looks like a win for scissors ,2
2002-04-23, The shock of the results of France's presidential polls on Sunday was the coup de grace to a bad day for Germany's chancellor Gerhard Schroder as his governing Social Democratic party suffered humiliation in regional polls in the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt Although the defeat of Lionel Jospin France's socialist prime minister will not immediately affect Franco-German relations the blow to the French left will affect the mood as Mr Schroder steps up his campaign for re-election in September Rudolf von Thadden the German government's co-ordinator for Franco-German relations said The result won't be an encumbrance on day-to-day politics But people will see the right is gaining ground and the left is shrinking and that has consequences for Gerhard Schroder  There was little hiding the scale of the SPD's defeat In the biggest swing in any German election support for Mr Schroder's party slumped by nearly 16 percentage points to 20 per cent while the opposition Christian Democrats' share climbed by 15 percentage points to 37 3 per cent The CDU and the liberal Free Democrats who surged back into the state parliament with a 13 3 per cent vote will probably form the next government replacing the SPD after eight years Opposition leaders seized the result the most important test of public opinion before September's general elections as pointing to a national change of power This was a clear vote against the policies of Gerhard Schroder said Edmund Stoiber the conservative challenger for the chancellorship It is a signal that change is also possible federally noted Angela Merkel the CDU's leader Top SPD officials tried to play down the defeat noting the exceptionally low turnout and domination of local issues This is no prejudgement on what will be decided on September 22 said Franz Muntefering the SPD's general secretary But behind the scenes yesterday the SPD was hinting at strategy adjustments One such change was concentrating even more on Mr Schroder the party's most popular politician Although trailing the opposition as a party by up to 5 percentage points in the opinion polls SPD officials have long stressed their leader's significantly higher personal popularity than Mr Stoiber So a campaign already expected to be focused on the two candidates is now likely to become more personalised In addition the message from the SPD will be to drive home its achievements With the economy dominating the campaign party leaders yesterday gave a foretaste of what was to come Seizing on leaks that Germany's six leading economic institutes would today raise growth forecasts for this year to 0 9 per cent Mr Muntefering claimed the economy was visibly recovering The revised strategy is full of risks With little control over the pace of recovery the SPD will be vulnerable to any disruptions in the tentative upswing External risks such as oil prices or internal shocks such as the threat of industrial action by the powerful I G Metall engineering union would upset the party's plans Focusing more on the chancellor also has its perils A CDU-FDP coalition in Saxony Anhalt would give the opposition a majority in the Bundesrat the upper parliamentary chamber where Germany's federal states are represented Five years ago the SPD used a similar advantage to embarrass Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led government by constantly blocking its legislation The disruptive power this time is more limited as Mr Schroder has pushed through most of his reforms But the opposition could maximise its hold over the Bundesrat to deflate the image of competence one of the chancellor's biggest electoral assets ,3
2002-06-12, Shares in Omnicom the world's third-biggest advertising group have taken investors on a rollercoaster ride over the past few days amid worries the company could become ensnared in post-Enron concerns about disclosure Last week they tumbled 16 per cent as rumours swirled of looming revelations prompting the company to put out a statement saying it knew of no corporate development to account for the market activity in its stock This week the shares have made a partial recovery amid support from Wall Street analysts and hopes that the rumours will prove unfounded Yet jitters remain fed by the company's disclosure that a former head of its audit committee had resigned Although not the biggest of the world's advertising supergroups Omnicom is widely regarded as the best both in terms of its long-term financial performance and quality of assets Among its subsidiaries are BBDO DDB and TBWA three of the highest regarded advertising networks Its other assets include OMD one of the world's biggest media-buying networks and more than 100 marketing branding public relations and other specialist communications companies Omnicom has a reputation for increasing revenues and profits Yet by the end of last year even its most enthusiastic admirers were surprised by its ability to shrug off the worst advertising recession in living memory Full-year revenues rose 12 per cent to $6 9bn and net profits rose 16 per cent to $503m the company reported in February Some of that growth was fed by acquisitions but perhaps more surprisingly in a conference call with analysts Omnicom said its underlying revenues rose 8 5 per cent even though worldwide advertising and marketing revenues were estimated to have fallen 5 per cent over the same period Although there is no suggestion of impropriety still less any breaking of the rules some industry executives question whether Omnicom employs overly aggressive methods of accounting for organic growth Differences of interpretation occur when an acquisition is made part-way through a year If a company acquired on June 30 has revenues of $100m for the full year and those revenues increase to $105m in the first full year under its new owner how much underlying growth should its new owner report According to one analyst Omnicom counts as organic growth the difference between the $50m contribution in the first year and the $105m in the second year But yesterday John Wren Omnicom's chief executive strongly denied this saying That's just nonsense that my competitors or short-sellers are putting about  Mr Wren said that in the first full year of acquisition Omnicom would take $5m of the $105m of revenues as organic growth and $100m as acquisition-related But even this is more aggressive than the policy of WPP the industry's biggest group which does not count any growth as organic until it occurs after the first anniversary of the acquisition Mr Wren countered that Omnicom's method was the more conservative because it allowed for the effects of declines in revenues from new acquisitions as well as increases A second concern recently publicised in a UK industry newsletter called New Media Agencies Financial Intelligence is that Omnicom used what the newsletter describes as a clever ploy to avoid taking a hit in last year's accounts for the massive losses sustained by internet companies in which it had invested The newsletter describes how in May last year Omnicom struck a deal with leveraged buyout financier Craig Cogut through which Omnicom's internet investments were hived off into an investment company called Seneca in exchange for a special type of non-convertible preferred stock The complex arrangement avoided the need for Omnicom to take a write-down Again there is no suggestion of impropriety or rule-breaking But Bob Willott the newsletter's editor said the arrangement suggested very skilful financial engineering which although in some ways to Omnicom's credit should in his opinion have been made more obvious Mr Wren said the arrangement with Seneca had been more fully disclosed than any other event in Omnicom's history including filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission The deal had been struck to enable restructuring experts to get to grips with the internet companies he said The Seneca vehicle drew the attention of Robert Callender an Omnicom board member who chaired the company's audit committee Prompted in part by the Enron scandal Mr Callander launched a review of Omnicom's relationship with its accounting firm Andersen He came to question whether the board had approved the Seneca vehicle According to Omnicom Mr Callander held that the board had not approved the creation of Seneca Other board members countered it had been approved under a working name later changed to Seneca Mr Callander 72 resigned from the board in May Analysts say he resigned when it became clear he was likely to be replaced as head of the audit committee He could not be reached for comment ,2
2002-06-19, Russia is set to issue $700m of international bonds in restructuring one of the remaining sections of its Soviet-era commercial debt Russia will use the new bonds to restructure $1 2bn of Soviet debt inherited from the International Bank for Economic Co-operation and the International Investment Bank the Soviet institutions involved in trade finance within the former Communist bloc The deal is important because it brings Russia closer to returning to the international capital markets after its 1998 financial crisis Russian officials said the country would not issue new debt until it had restructured old Soviet debt Russia has still to issue up to $2bn worth of new bonds to restructure Soviet debt owed by foreign trade organisations The restructuring of the Soviet commercial debt is another milestone on the way to Russia's recovery and reintegration in the international capital markets said Philip Poole chief emerging markets economist at ING The Soviet commercial debt is likely to be restructured on terms similar to those granted by the London Club of commercial creditors Under that deal 37 per cent of the principal and 33 per cent of interest were written off Russia is expected to return to the international capital markets by the end of this year with an issue of between $1bn and $2bn ,3
2002-06-06, Manuel Pangilinan the Filipino chairman of First Pacific faces the unwelcome prospect of watching what by all accounts has been his life's work slip from his grasp following the offer for the Hong Kong company's Philippine interests Mr Pangilinan is known for his seven-day weeks and has little time for social niceties Legend has it he is such a workaholic he once even called a staff meeting in the middle of an employee's wedding celebrations It should come as no surprise then that Mr Pangilinan is reluctant to give up Philippine Long Distance Telephone PLDT even at the risk of a bust-up with First Pacific's controlling shareholder the Salim Group which is led by his long-time associate Anthony Salim He Mr Pangilinan has virtually donated his soul to that company said Robert Sassoon an analyst with SG Securities in Hong Kong A confrontation between the pair has been a long time in coming Mr Pangilinan and Mr Salim the scion of the Salim Group formerly Indonesia's most powerful conglomerate became partners more than 20 years ago when both were aspiring young businessmen Formerly with American Express Bank Mr Pangilinan set up First Pacific in 1981 with another partner and began managing the Salim investments By the mid-1990s the company had built up multi-billion-dollar ventures across Asia and in Europe Mr Salim was the model shareholder giving Mr Pangilinan a free hand to run the company The Indonesian tycoon is said to have been so happy with the direction of the company he rarely bothered to turn up to First Pacific board meetings Following the Asian financial crisis of 1997/1998 however Mr Pangilinan became increasingly preoccupied with his native Philippines He sold down the group's other interests and bought First Pacific's 24 4 per cent stake in PLDT and a stake in developer Metro Pacific His plan was to revitalise PLDT the country's dominant telecommunications operator which had been heavily battered by the crisis He achieved some success Last year PLDT's net income tripled to 3 4bn pesos $67m on the back of rising revenue from its mobile services These now contribute more than a third of the phone company's revenue from only 7 per cent in 1999 when it was acquired by First Pacific But it was a case of too little too late Though PLDT's share price has risen since late last year it is still only a third of the 1420 pesos per share that First Pacific paid when it bought the stake in November 1999 Last year First Pacific reduced the book value of its investments in PLDT and two other companies taking a one-time loss of $1 7bn Even if he is the best manager PLDT ever had the fact is First Pacific's investment in the phone company has declined by half since 1999 said Francis Varela vice-president at Manila-based AB Capital Investment First Pacific or its shareholders need to sell very badly he added Most analysts believe that it was Mr Salim who initiated talks to sell First Pacific's investments in PLDT and Metro Pacific to a company controlled by Philippines' Gokongwei family The plan which was first revealed last week is thought to have caught Mr Pangilinan off balance He is rumoured to be considering mounting a counter-bid backed by a loose coalition of investors including Japan's NTT which has a 15 per cent stake in PLDT But a counter-bid would be prohibitively expensive Gokongwei is offering more than 1000 pesos per share for PLDT a massive premium over its current market price If Mr Pangilinan does mount a challenge most analysts believe he would have to resign as First Pacific chairman But whether he stays or goes for most First Pacific investors the main thing is that the deal goes through Everyone wants to see the back of Mr Pangilinan's ill-fated foray into the Philippines ,1

2002-06-06, The Australian economy grew slightly less than expected in the first quarter but at an annualised rate of 4 2 per cent was still far stronger than almost all other industrialised nations The growth rate could yet accelerate further despite yesterday's decision to raise interest rates for the second time in a month According to figures released yesterday gross domestic product rose by 0 9 per cent in the first three months of the year down from a revised 1 2 per cent in the last quarter of 2001 and below the consensus forecast of 1 2 per cent or 4 5 per cent on an annualised basis The shortfall was blamed on a sharp contraction in public investment which fell 17 per cent in the quarter shaving 0 8 percentage points off growth But economists said this was likely to be reversed in the coming months adding that business investment was also expected to pick up strongly Though well below the consensus this is a better result than it looks said Grant Fitzner at HSBC in Sydney Most of the key components were very robust indeed  The data were published two hours after the Reserve Bank of Australia lifted official interest rates for the second time in a month citing an improving global outlook and the strengthening in the domestic economy It lifted the benchmark cash rate by 25 basis points to 4 75 per cent as widely expected Consumer spending is showing robust growth supported by growth in incomes and by ongoing increases in wealth associated with rising house prices said Ian Macfarlane the central bank governor Business confidence too is at a high level and businesses are reporting a substantial increase in planned investment in the coming year With the international environment likely to continue improving conditions overall should remain conducive to growth of the Australian economy  With the bank warning that inflation stood at the top of its target range and was likely to remain so because of stronger growth economists expect rates to rise to 5 5 per cent or 6 per cent by the end of the year reversing cuts totalling 200 basis points last year However following yesterday's slightly weaker than expected data economists said the bank which holds monthly monetary policy meetings might now wait until August or September before making its next move Officials also appear confident that the improved global economic outlook will offset the impact on exports of the recent strengthening of the Australian dollar The currency has appreciated by more than 10 per cent against the US dollar so far this year hitting a 21-month high of 57 44 US cents on Tuesday before slipping back to 57 24 US cents yesterday You can lose your super-competitive exchange rate but still have competitive exchange rates said Peter Costello the treasurer More important for us will be the fact that the world economy growing will give our exports more markets to find ,2
2002-06-08, The flood of negativenews across the telecoms sector this week has driven many stocks to all-time lows Warnings from the likes of Sweden's Ericsson the Swedish mobile phones group and Intel a leading supplier of chips for mobiles have made investors increasingly nervous about crumbling revenues and debt burdens at fixed-line operators as well as growth prospects for mobile operators We've had bad news in a sector that is already weak says James Golob analyst at Goldman Sachs This has come at a time when stocks have already fallen through technical support levels  The wave of selling was sparked by Ericsson the world's largest mobile equipment company Kurt Hellstrom chief executive told the Financial Times on Tuesday that there was a risk it could see no improvement in market conditions next year On Thursday Intel the world's largest chip manufacturer said it expected second quarter revenues to come in between $6 2bn £4 24bn and $6 5bn lower than its previous target of $6 4bn-$7bn While analysts saw few direct implications for telecoms stocks from Intel's announcement it added to the poor newsflow Perhaps worse for the telecoms sector was a revenue warning from RF Micro Devices a US semiconductor company that makes chips for mobile handset makers including Nokia the market leader Nokia's shares yesterday closed down 7 4 per cent at {XEU}13 11 Potentially what this means is a delay in the roll-out of new handset models which means lower market share and profitability said Richard Windsor analyst at Nomura The bad news was not confined to equipment manufacturers however Figures released by J-Phone Vodafone's Japanese subsidiary were seen as evidence that industry-wide subscriber growth in Japan could also be slowing Meanwhile AirGate one of the largest partners of Sprint the US mobile operator indicated that subscriber growth for the three months to the end of June could be almost half its forecasts In Europe France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom fell to all-time lows yesterday as investors became increasingly nervous Everyone is expecting France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to do an equity raising in the near future said Jelena Olman analyst at JP Morgan Chase In the UK Vodafone and MMO{2} the mobile business spun out of BT Group hit new lows for the year over mounting concerns about future growth in the mobile sector MMO{2} closed at 37{3/4}p valuing the company at just over £3 3bn $4 81bn a fraction of the money it paid for its third-generation mobile phone licences in the UK and Germany And in the US even parts of the telecoms industry that had seemed immune from the devastation are now showing signs of weakness Rating agency Moody's warned last week that it might downgrade Verizon the biggest of the Baby Bell local carriers because of its mounting debt The Bells with their near-monopoly on local calling had seemed a safe haven during the crisis that has hit long-distance carriers But e-mail and wireless calls are eating into the Bells' core business and the number of local access lines in use in the US is now falling for the first time since the birth of the telecoms industry Wireless companies while drawing business away from traditional wireline carriers are faring little better Deregulation in the mid- 1990s has left six national wireless companies more than exist in most other developed countries and a price war has broken out At the same time the uncertain US economy and belt-tightening by corporate customers has robbed them of the sort of growth that they had been expecting It is the long-distance business however where the pain is greatest With several new companies set up in the late-1990s to build nationwide fibre-optic networks in anticipation of a boom in internet and data business the over-capacity has proved crippling Two big tests in June could now provide a clue about how this situation will be sorted out Creditors of Global Crossing will hold an auction of the long-haul carrier which filed for bankruptcy protection in the US earlier this year WorldCom the second-largest long-distance company hopes to renegotiate a new $5bn secured loan facility from its bankers before the end of the month heading off the liquidity crisis that has bedevilled it in recent weeks Without that loan in place WorldCom is far more likely to seek the sort of early debt restructuring that many investors believe will be inevitable anyway Analysts say there is little sign of an upturn for the telecoms sector in the near term Recent declines in fixed line revenues the big cash cows of the incumbents have raised concerns that some operators could face increasing difficulties in servicing their debt without a capital restructuring Even though they are at all-time lows I don't see a bottom yet With France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom there may be no bottom until they either change management or change strategy says Ms Olman The short-term outlook for mobile operators is little better Where is the reason for mobile stocks to outperform European investors are running scared and there are no marginal buyers in the US says Jamie Mariani analyst at ABN Amro The US investor does not want to hold European cellular stocks at the moment because of their large premium to US operators and because they see more 3G spending on the horizon with an uncertain return profile  Mr Mariani believes growth expectations for mobile operators are still too demanding but argues that widespread launches of camera phones and expected rises in average revenues per user later in the year could signal the first upturn for the sector But without the growth promised by mobile operators many analysts believe mobile stocks will find it difficult to recover If you don't believe in new growth from wireless data the European mobile operators are probably still overvalued ,2
2002-04-03, It is always high summer in Portmeirion's best-selling Botanic Garden tableware range where butterflies flutter around clematis blossoms But last year the sharp frost of the US downturn nipped profits growth at the Stoke-on-Trent cera-mics maker Anglophile American customers who generate over half its sales were feeling the pinch and profits withered from £3 35m to £1 62m The decline was worst in the first half triggering the resignation of chief executive Kami Farhadi who for 20 years had served a company set up to make souvenirs for the Portmeirion holiday village in Wales The economic downturn in the US was compounded by the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the UK which briefly dispelled the nostalgia many American consumers feel for the English countryside Alan Miles managing director said I was in the US and every television news bulletin began with a giant barbecue of slaughtered livestock  This checked sales in the UK as well as in the US domestic turnover of about £15m is strongly supported by the purchases of overseas tourists The events of September 11 then pruned back US turnover in the fourth quarter Mr Miles said Customers stayed away from department stores because city centres were seen as vulnerable to attack  But last week Portmeirion's headquarters was bathed in spring sunshine Arthur Ralley its chairman says There has been a slow but steady improvement in the US which started over Christmas with the discount retailers The big department stores such as Federated & May which destocked heavily last year are turning the taps back on There has meanwhile been a strong improvement in the small slice of sales from Japan  This is good news for Portmeirion's workers in a city that has suffered job losses in traditional industries such as steel tyres and ceramics Now the company is refreshing the 30-year-old tableware range that underpins its fortunes Responding to demand driven by TV chefs it recently launched a Botanic Garden pestle and mortar People have realised their lives are incomplete without one even if they only use it twice says a deadpan Mr Miles ,2
2002-06-07, Several large US media groups are to meet German counterparts in the next two weeks to discuss joint bids for the assets of KirchMedia the rights and television business of the collapsed Kirch empire KirchMedia has a 50 2 per cent stake in ProSiebenSAT 1 Germany's largest free-to-air TV broadcaster and has attracted interest from such US groups as Viacom AOL Time Warner and Disney Possible German bidding partners include publishing groups Bauer Burda Holtzbrinck WAZ Gruppe and Axel Springer itself owner of an 11 8 per cent stake in ProSiebenSAT 1 UBS Warburg which has a mandate to run the auction has asked about 60 parties to declare their interest by Tuesday next week and will be expecting concrete bids by the end of the summer In ateaser sent last week the bank said it is anticipated that a creditor meeting will probably take place in August which could decide on the future of KirchMedia based on the offers on the table Meanwhile people close to KirchMedia's minority shareholders who together control 20 8 per cent of the unit said the management had given them until June 10 to present a refinancing plan as an alternative to the auction Without such a plan KirchMedia will be put under administration by the middle of next month and its assets switched into a new company which would then be put up for sale free of existing liabilities We will not have enough time we have been doing due diligence but we have not even looked at ProSieben yet one shareholder said My guess is the management cannot wait to create a new company  If these guys are trying to drag us into a competitive bidding process they are wasting their time and over-estimating the proceeds We have wasted too much time and money in Kirch  While Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset the only media companies to own stakes in KirchMedia may still have an interest in the business a competitive auction now seems the most likely outcome An adviser to one of the potential bidders said it was too early and the information included in the 40-page teaser about KirchMedia's 28 companies too vague to hazard a range for the bids I do not expect more than half a dozen bidders to remain at the end and the most serious ones will be going for the entire business rather than bits and pieces But I'm sure no one will get into this if they have to take on any liability the adviser said People close to KirchMedia said most US suitors had signalled they would bid both for KirchMedia's ProSiebenSAT 1 stake and its film rights library About half the big US houses want the sports rights business as well  Separately people close to Axel Springer said its management board would block any attempt by Clemens Vedder a large shareholder in Commerzbank to take over the 40 per cent stake in the publisher held by Kirch Financial Times Deutschland reported yesterday that Mr Vedder had approached Deutsche Bank which is poised to seize the stake as collateral for a loan it made to Kirch about buying the shares Axel Springer directors have a veto on any sale of the group's shares ,1
2002-06-29, It began with Enron and ended with WorldCom That sentence sums up a melancholy first half for equity investors when the US UK French and German markets all suffered double-digit losses If 2000 was the year when the dotcom bubble burst and 2001 was the year when investors faced the horror of mass terrorism 2002 has been the year of corporate shenanigans As one scandal has followed another investors have gradually lost confidence in the integrity of US corporate accounts And if you can't trust the numbers why should you buy the shares The opinions of the executives themselves about the numbers seem perfectly clear As Bijal Shah and Dhaval Joshi of Societe Generale point out share sales by US directors outnumber purchases by four to one In the past such a predominance of share sales has been a pretty reliable lead indicator of disappointing profits growth At the start of the year most investors were hoping for at a global economic recovery led by the US That expectation is broadly on track But it is not showing up in higher revenues for the corporate sector according to SG US business sales are still falling year-on-year Clearly individual companies can improve profits during periods of flat or falling sales by cutting costs But at the overall market level one company's costs are another company's revenues So it is not surprising that US directors are sellers of their own stock and it is understandable that global investors are pessimistic about the prospects for profits growth Disillusionment with the US corporate sector is also showing up in the foreign exchange markets The dollar dipped close to parity with the euro this week and the Japanese have been desperately intervening to prevent the yen from rising too far against the greenback A dollar fall presents its own challenges for the global economy During the late 1990s a strong dollar more or less suited everyone European and Asian exporters enjoyed the competitive boost while lower import prices kept the lid on inflationary pressures in the booming US economy Globalisation and the emergence of China as the ultimate low-cost producer were sending deflationary pressures through the global economy The strong dollar allowed Europe and the rest of Asia to export these pressures to the US which was strong enough to take the strain If the US is now going to send those pressures back how will Europe and Asia cope Jay Pelosky the Morgan Stanley strategist hopes that the rest of the world can take over the US's role as the engine of growth Viewed in this light a falling dollar might be positive for the global economy But at the moment the dollar's weakness seems more of a function of concerns about the US rather than enthusiasm for the prospects of Europe and Asia The weakness of the dollar and the third consecutive negative year for equities have prompted a natural enthusiasm among investors for alternative asset categories With returns on cash not that appealing investors have understandably turned to physical assets The US and UK are enjoying residential property booms Gold has leapt past $325 an ounce and the mining and forestry sectors have been two of the best three equity performers in the world Within equities Europe and the US have been left far behind by emerging markets such as Indonesia South Africa and Russia and by Japan arguably the ultimate contrarian play For traditional fund managers the strong performance of gold and emerging markets while interesting will be of little comfort Few will have more than a token exposure to gold or Indonesia For pension funds and insurance companies this third successive year of dismal investment returns is becoming a mounting problem Both groups have promises to keep promises that depend on healthy financial markets Weak markets either force them to raise more capital or to switch from equities into bonds a process that only accelerates the market's decline Such forced sales are not yet widespread and the UK regulator tried to head them off yesterday by relaxing the reslilence tests on the insurance industry But perhaps there will be no more shocks Arguably the markets have spent the first half of the year in a funk about a whole spate of bad news not just the US corporate scandals but violence in the Middle East tension between India and Pakistan and the US government's warnings about further terrorist attacks on the mainland If anything positive has come out of all this worrying it is that central banks in the US UK and continental Europe have not felt able to take back any of the emergency rate cuts they made in the wake of September 11 In the first quarter of the year bond markets were worried that the central banks might be taking their eye off the ball But in the second quarter bond yields fell sharply as investors realised there was little justification for higher short-term rates So it is easy to envisage a positive outlook for equities in the second half The world muddles along without war or significant terrorist incidents There are no more scandals on the scale of Enron or WorldCom Short-term interest rates stay low and bond yields fall further The global economy and corporate profits gradually pick up steam All of this could come to pass But it will take a while before investors feel confident that they have turned the corner Any recovery in equities will be halting and vulnerable to external shocks philip coggan@ft com,2

2002-06-27, The direct link between Japan's fragile economic recovery and the state of the US economy was underlined yesterday after the WorldCom scandal on Wall Street triggered a 4 per cent drop in the Nikkei 225 and the dollar's weakness forced the government to intervene in foreign exchange markets for the second time this week The Nikkei 225 lost 422 points to close at 10074 a 4 02 per cent decline that takes it to its lowest since February 20 a level at which companies face huge losses on their securities portfolios if the market's weakness persists until the end of the first half of the fiscal year The decision by the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Bank of Japan to intervene to weaken the yen for the sixth time in five weeks also indicates the degree to which it is trying to shore up the economy by ensuring exports which are driving the recovery remain buoyant On top of these pressures there were also some terse comments aimed at Junichiro Koizumi Japan's prime minister from President George W Bush of the US on his arrival at the meeting of G8 industrialised nations' leaders in Canada where he was told to restore Japan's economy to health more quickly The combination of market weakness attempts to weaken the currency artificially and international criticism of the state of the economy sits unhappily with the messages being sent out by the government and the central bank that the economy has bottomed out While there have been signs the economic decline is slowing yesterday's events highlight the extent to which Japan's future will be determined by making cheap exports to the US rather than benign economic management at home The BoJ intervened on Monday after the yen neared Y120 to the dollar but the move failed to arrest the rise As the yen again approached the Y120 level yesterday the central bank once again opened its coffers It has spent around $20bn £13 6bn {XEU}20 6bn so far on its intervention Mr Koizumi and Mr Bush met yesterday for about 40 minutes during which the Japanese prime minister described his reforms as progressing steadily and added that treatment of banks' non-performing loans was improving Both these claims contradict the views of private sector analysts who have argued that Mr Koizumi's reforms are stalled and that new non-performing loans are being generated as quickly as the old ones are being eliminated Back in Japan the central bank voted unanimously to keep monetary policy unchanged for the sixth consecutive meeting despite having upgraded its assessment of the state of the economy for the past four months Attention will now focus on the results of the closely watched quarterly Tankan survey of business confidence which will be publisehd on July 1 ,2
2002-06-28, The clouds of gloom and uncertainty that have settled over the UK's life assurance sector can be traced to one fundamental cause the miserable performance of global equity markets where assurers invest most of their assets This week's plunge in the global bond market following the crisis at WorldCom the US telecommunications company means most holders of bonds will also have made negative returns in the first half of this year increasing the pressure on life assurers' finances Last week the Financial Services Authority the principal City regulator acknowledged it could hear alarm bells ringing from the sector after the FTSE 100 had again plunged below the 5000 mark Since the markets peaked in September 2000 shares have lost a third of their value Ned Cazalet an independent analyst estimates the life industry has seen its spare capital reduced over the past two years from more than £100bn to about £30bn and that figure is likely to have shrunk further following the recent fall in the markets Unlike most continental European life assurers who declare a guaranteed policy surrender value every year UK life offices value policies when they mature giving much of the return through a final bonus This gives UK assurers the flexibility to invest more heavily in equities which have historically outperformed bonds However UK offices are obliged to report the market value of their equity holdings whereas continental European offices can carry them at book value Assurers are also obliged to maintain minimum solvency margins in their funds This is subject to a resilience test which measures the ability of a fund to withstand significant falls in asset prices such as equities and fixed-interest securities Mr Cazalet said A typical with-profits fund needs to make about an 8 per cent annual return just for its solvency position to stand still Last year the average return was minus 9 to 10 per cent and this year they have had a return so far of about minus 7 per cent  The FSA twice relaxed its resilience test last year following concerns that assurers would be forced to sell shares in order to bolster their financial position The first relaxation was announced a few hours before the attacks on the World Trade Center when the FTSE 100 stood at 5034 The FSA said after September 11 that several UK life assurers were trading close to their regulatory solvency margin But the regulator also emphasised these margins were set high and therefore did not mean any companies were close to commercial insolvency The FSA is unwilling to relax its resilience test again because it undermines the credibility of any regulatory regime to keep moving the goalposts In any case it said the previous changes were more concerned with addressing market turbulence than the absolute level of share prices Life assurers' recently published statutory returns to the regulator have also graphically illustrated the pressure on their finances The returns show 11 of the UK's 20 biggest life assurance funds used future profits to help bolster their solvency position at the end of last year Although counting future profits as capital in this way is legal the practice has been described by the FSA as effectively mortgaging future margins in life business The regulation is expected to be changed soon An analysis of life offices' statutory returns by Nottingham University's Centre for Risk and Insurance also showed that the free assets capital in excess of liabilities of many were sharply reduced reflecting the decline in investment returns The free asset ratio the excess of assets over the sum of the company's liabilities and the required solvency margin is monitored by independent financial advisers seeking to judge the strength of individual companies It is not an ideal measure because it can be be manipulated by financial engineering techniques such as reinsurance The 11 funds that included future profits boosted their capital by £5 5bn Without this the average free assets ratio of the top 20 would have been 5 8 per cent rather than the 7 1 per cent reported In 2000 only five offices included a total of £2 4bn of future profits without which the average free assets ratio would have been 11 2 per cent In 1999 the average free assets ratio without future profits was 18 5 per cent However Chris O'Brien director of the Nottingham centre said all the companies analysed had sufficient assets to meet not only their liabilities but also the solvency margin they were required to hold He said So long as these companies are managed carefully there is nothing for policyholders to panic about  This pressure on their investment returns comes at a time when UK life offices were already struggling to adapt to a much tougher commercial environment Since April last year they have had to cope with the challenges of selling stakeholder pensions whose annual charges are capped by the government at 1 per cent of funds under management offering much lower margins than previously enjoyed by the industry The highly publicised crisis over guaranteed annuity rate policies at Equitable Life the mutual office has also sparked a flight to quality with some of the strongest new business figures being recorded by the largest groups such as Standard Life and Norwich Union Analysts believe only a few other big assurers such as Prudential Legal & General Aegon Zurich and AMP will have the scale to compete in the cut-throat stakeholder market Since no fewer than 48 companies registered as stakeholder providers the stage appears to be set for another wave of consolidation in a sector that has already seen a spate of deals and demutualisations in recent years However the recent focus on solvency does not mean life assurers are likely to go bust There are currently 40 general insurers in a formal insolvency process in the UK most of which had failed in the 1990s and their gross insurance liabilities amount to more than £12 5bn Only one life assurer has become insolvent in recent years Oak Life which collapsed in 1993 This is because life assurers always have the option of closing their doors to new business which immediately improves their finances by removing the upfront costs of acquiring policyholders Such closed offices of which Equitable Life is currently the most prominent example can then concentrate on managing their assets for the benefit of existing policyholders Life offices also have discretion to reduce their bonus pay-outs so policyholders end up receiving something even it is much less than they would have hoped Recently life assurance shares have themselves underperformed the market as a whole Over the past month the FTSE All-Share Index has fallen by 11 per cent but the life assurance sector has dropped by 19 per cent This partly reflects market unease that the industry faces an unprecedented amount of government and regulatory scrutiny Next month Ron Sandler a former chief executive of the Lloyd's of London insurance market will publish his Treasury-commissioned review of the long-term savings market which it is believed could put further pressure on profitability Analysts have long predicted further consolidation of the life industry The current financial pressures on even the biggest groups probably makes another wave of takeovers less likely A more probable outcome is that many of the smaller offices will quietly give up writing new business Mr Cazalet said There are a lot of companies out there that are like the walking dead It is surprising that more of them have not shut up shop already ,2
2002-04-03, Bernie Ecclestone the Hin-dujas Enron and Lakshmi Mittal Labour has paid a high price for courting business to secure donations for party or government projects regularly forced to defend itself against allegations of cash for favours But it is not only Labour and other political parties that are suffering Businesses says it has become too much trouble to write out cheques Following new rules on disclosure pushed through by the government not only are all political donations above £5000 made public by the parties but shareholder approval must be sought The government has made it almost impossible for companies to give money without appearing corrupt said a public relations director of a company and former donor We now have to justify it to our shareholders but with all the allegations about sleaze we cannot say it helps gain access or keep up our profile with the government It's a bureaucratic nightmare and not worth the hassle  In any case there are better ways for companies to get their voice heard in Whitehall and more effective ways to spend their money For some companies the thirst for political insight is so great that nothing short of hiring their own government insider will do BP made the post-election season's biggest signing when it hired Anji Hunter one of Tony Blair's longest-serving and closest aides as director of communications last autumn Her appointment coincided with BP's decision to stop all political donations Lord Browne its chief executive said at the time We must be particularly careful about the political process   because the legitimacy of that process is crucial both for society and for us  Tesco snapped up David North an agriculture adviser to Mr Blair while Express Newspapers hired Margaret McDonagh former general secretary of the Labour party If you are operating in a highly regulated sector or in an area the government is unhappy with hiring a former aide can be invaluable in helping predict the end-ame said one company executive who hired a former aide in 1998 Other companies choose instead to take advantage of the political experience on offer at numerous public affairs and PR companies a magnet for former advisers and researchers Sun Life and Provincial now part of the insurance group AXA freely admits it would prefer to spend money on hiring in this sort of advice than make a donation Sun Life gave £15000 to the Conservative party and £15000 to the Labour party in 1998 then stopped making donations following growing protest from shareholders It was the board's view that people were questioning the rationale for making political donations  Consultants say they are tapped for advice on whom to call when to call and most importantly what to say There is no point in telling a government official you don't like a piece of legislation because it undermines your position said one We explain to our clients why we think the government is doing something and how to construct their case in terms ministers will find appealing  Political consultants are on hand to tell companies how to take advantage of the numerous routes Labour has opened up to communicate with business in the form of taskforces ad hoc advisory groups and reviews Since coming to office in 1997 it has set up more than 320 taskforces with more than 2500 members According to Red Star Research a group dedicated to charting Labour's links with business there are plenty of places for for company directors Business leaders take up 96 of the 108 places on Treasury taskforces and 75 per cent of the Department of Trade and Industry groups One former DTI official says it is easy to overstate the benefit of a place on a taskforce where members often spend more time with competitors than key government insiders There is also some evidence suggesting businesses are waking up to this Sir Peter Davis chief executive of J Sainsbury turned down an offer to head a review into the role of non-executive directors Industry insiders say his non-executives questioned what benefit it would bring the company If companies are still determined to make donations to cosy up to ministers the best advice is to consider sponsoring one of the vast array of social programmes with government backing That avoids both negative publicity and the problem of getting shareholder approval It's hard to object to a breakfast club for under-privileged kids said one public affairs adviser One Downing Street adviser says this pushes all the right buttons Companies who get involved in community events and sponsor local activities are showing corporate social responsibility and that gives them an in on the wider public policy debate It is not a direct route into government but ministers will be predisposed towards you Your involvement bubbles up and you are judged to have a legitimate voice  Think-tanks offer another route to associating a company with relevant policy issues The Institute for Public Policy Research Labour's favourite think-tank receives half its project funding from corporates and has worked with LLoyds TSB on Building Stronger Communities research Shell BMW British Gas and Innogy helped fund a publication on the low-carbon economy Demos whose advisory council chair is Geoff Mulgan head of the government's Forward Strategy Unit received core funding from British Gas Cable and Wireless NatWest Shell Northern Foods and Tesco Aventis sponsored the Fabian Society's health policy forum with Alan Milburn the health secretary as opening speaker Think-tanks are invaluable in helping get your case across Not only are you associated with the policy areas but with a bit of luck the report will generate a row and a bit of publicity and help generate political pressure in the area said one public affairs consultant Ministers like to be associated with them to help them look more intellectual  If all else fails a seat at a fundraising dinner will get directors under the same roof as ministers These events are rather expensive lotteries where companies stump up £500 a head in the hope that their table will be graced by a cabinet minister While some political advisers believe these events are unbeatable for networking a shrewd chief executive will check in advance whom he has bagged They lure in you by saying that you will meet senior members of the party but in the end you only shake hands with them and will spend the dinner next to a backbencher listening to himself talk and leave knowing little about your business said one These things are really designed for the politically naive ,3
2002-06-10, Faced with a dismalinitial public offering market anda dearth of venture capital Telemais Telecommunication the start-up Brazilian fixed line and wireless group found an unusual way to raise cash from US investors First it became a US company merging with NetBet com a defunct internet gaming group that had been trading over the counter Shareholders in NetBet exchanged 90 per cent of their company for about 10 per cent of Telemais giving the Brazilian group a US domicile and some liquidity Now Telemais is courting new investors with $10m-$15m of capital raising that will put another 10-15 per cent of the company on to the market Executives recently took a roadshow to Boston New York Atlanta and Montreal and will travel to Miami later this month Soon the company will list on a US and perhaps a European exchange We're concentrating on institutions already invested in Latin America and telecoms said Charles Frewen director of corporate finance at Alpes Corretora de Cambio the banker for the deal Telemais's fundraising efforts may be unconventional but they were the best option Mr Frewen said In Brazil there has been one IPO since January and that business had been around for 10 years he explained There was no appetite for a start-up telecoms company offering Telemais encountered the same problem in the US Venture capitalists are retrenching and the IPO market is completely dried up so raising the capital could take six months to a year with the chance that it wouldn't be a success Mr Frewen said Meanwhile Telemais had obtained licences to extend voice data and internet services to 93 Brazilian municipalities and needed $400m to pay for its infrastructure The Brazilian government which charged less than $10000 for each of Telemais' four licences in an effort to stimulate competition promised low cost loans that would cover 90 per cent of Telemais' costs But the company needed outside financing for the rest Time is an element Mr Frewen said This seemed to be the most logical way of developing the business  However even though Telemais is now a publicly traded US company making its latest capital raising a secondary offering of ordinary shares not American Depositary Receipts investors will no doubt be wary Brazil is still a volatile emerging market and fears that the country may elect a leftist president in October have rocked the country's markets Telemais may also suffer from being grouped in the ailing telecoms sector It is Mr Frewen's job to calm investors on both counts Brazil's economy in fact is in extremely good shape he said Inflation is very much under control and we're increasing exports  Telemais is in a different position than its US and European counterparts because those companies paid billions and billions for their licenses while Telemais paid less than $40000 for licenses valued at $175m Mr Frewen said Also Brazil has an average of 8 3 to 12 4 telephone lines per 100 people compared with well over 100 lines per 100 people in the US so demand is strong Telemais will not compete with established local groups such as Brazil Telecom and Telefonica because it is targeting towns with 200000 residents or less in southern regions where incomes are three times higher than the national average We'll have 1057m subscribers within three years and that's just if we satisfy the existing waiting lists Mr Frewen said Whatever happens people are not going to stop making phone calls  If Telemais is able to get funding and establish a large US investor base through the NetBet deal other Brazilian companies may take the non-IPO route too We certainly have another three or four deals waiting to look at the success of Telemais Mr Frewen added ,2
2002-06-14, As the futures industry waits with bated breath for US regulators to approve trading in single stock futures Chicago's exchanges are putting the finishing touches to One-Chicago their joint venture established to trade the instruments The exchange was formed in May last year to take advantage of the launch of trade in single stock futures widely traded in Europe and Asia but banned for 20 years in the US A single stock future is a futures contract on a single share In December 2000 the US congress passed legislation that aimed to lift the ban in 2001 but frustrated would-be participants are still waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve the rules under which they will trade While the wait continues and senior industry officials have recently indicated that a decision is imminent OneChicago is weeks away from finalising a new technical system designed to trade the products according to Bill Rainer OneChicago chairman and chief executive OneChicago is the result of rare co-operation between Chicago's traditionally rival exchanges with the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange holding about 44 per cent each and the Chicago Board of Trade holding about 9 per cent Management has the rest The purpose-built exchange whose offices are based in an annex of the vast 1930s-built CBOT building will be up against a handful of other exchanges approved to trade the products They include a Nasdaq-Liffe venture and Island ECN the US securities platform recently acquired by Instinet Liffe has pioneered trading in the product and has expanded the number of companies whose stock can be traded in this way to 122 from 25 in January of last year The exchange has been critical of the SEC's delay in approving the use of stock futures in the US a market that is regarded as key to giving the sector its critical mass arguing that it gives its competitors time to catch up Other exchanges namely Swiss-German Eurex have said they do not yet see a big market for the products But more are moving into the area with the Italian stock exchange planning to introduce the instruments in July Mr Rainer believes there will be sufficient demand mostly from traders already using established futures products that OneChicago will attract significant volume once trading starts in earnest At launch OneChicago will have 75-80 futures contracts on individual stocks such as Cisco Citigroup and Motorola It will also have 15-20 futures contracts on narrow-based indices contracts on small groups of stocks that allow an investor to take a position in a particular sector The exchange has taken steps to ensure sufficient liquidity in the contracts by assigning a handful of stocks to market-making firms or specialists that are obliged to provide continuous two-sided markets in those contracts We didn't want to take the risk of blank screens said Mr Rainer OneChicago has so far approved 24 lead market-makers of which 17 will be allocated between three and six stock futures at launch We're working with them on allocations as we speak said Mr Rainer who helped reverse the ban on single stock futures trading as a previous chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Initially the exchange expects most interest from hedge funds and other active institutional players Mr Rainer said trading would probably start slowly We'll be looking at any bugs in the system and getting our sea legs in the market I believe a lot of people will probably be following it but not trading it  If trading does pick up the question then becomes whether there will be enough business to go around the handful of exchanges jostling for a piece of the action I would be surprised if the market was big enough to support in any material way five exchanges said Mr Rainer I would also be surprised if it's a successful product if the market couldn't support at least two  Additional reporting by Aline van Duyn in London,2

2002-04-30, Nobody doubts the outcome of today's referendum to give General Pervez Musharraf five years more as president of Pakistan But fearful of a low turnout Pakistan's military regime has taken unprecedented measures to induce people to vote Waiving normal electoral procedures Islamabad has set up polling stations in just about every place imaginable including prisons hospitals and workplaces To ensure that state employees do not shirk the ballot box the regime has abandoned the normal practice of declaring a public holiday For those who are neither employed by the state nor incarcerated there is free transport provided by the municipal councillors elected in the military's supervised elections of last year There are more polling stations than public latrines said Asma Jahangir a leading human rights lawyer They are leaving nothing to chance  In a more serious vein the regime has also scrapped the electoral register and turned Pakistan into a single constituency This means that anyone can vote anywhere regardless of where they live Voters will apparently be stamped with indelible ink But sceptics including the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy a coalition of Pakistan's 15 largest political parties which oppose the referendum say that it will not stop people from voting early and voting often The heavy-handed manner in which the referendum has been conducted to the accompaniment of television propaganda about Gen Musharraf has alienated a lot of the regime's natural supporters A lot of us feel deeply embarrassed and let down by this referendum said Ghazi Salahuddin a senior television executive based in Karachi We saw Gen Musharraf as a man who was above the cheap tricks of politicians But he is proving himself to be no different  Those familiar with army-run plebiscites elsewhere in the world would find little to surprise them in Pakistan At every intersection Gen Musharraf's face adorns huge billboards portraying the simple soldier dressed in plain battle fatigues the hero general bedecked with medals the man of the people in turban and shalwar kameez  and the international statesman in a well-cut suit Although Gen Musharraf has pledged to stamp out Islamic extremism and modernise Pakistan it is not difficult to imagine him as the pious mullah were political circumstances to change Musharraf has promised to restore democracy create a modern economy eradicate illiteracy and provide clean drinking water said Ms Jahangir Just about the only thing he hasn't promised is to give husbands back to their widows  Hamida Khuro vice-president of a faction of the Pakistan Muslim's League that is supporting the general said Gen Musharraf's main aim was to institutionalise the role of the military in Pakistan politics According to her such a move provided the best hope of defending the country from its corrupt political parties and Islamic radical groups Pakistan has never been free of the military in its 55 years of existence said Ms Khuro So if you can't beat them you might as well join them  Such logic finds little echo among those preparing for national assembly elections in October Before the referendum campaign analysts had expected a fragmented political climate in which the various parties fought it out Now it seems they have a banner under which to unite In calling this referendum Gen Musharraf has galvanised the political parties in opposition to him said Mr Salahuddin The regime's western supporters believe the 58-year-old general remains the best hope of ensuring Pakistan's modernisation But today's poll guarantees that the country's politics will have a lasting military flavour Gen Musharraf has portrayed himself as a referee of democracy said Ms Jahangir But how can you be a referee when you are the only player,3

blue chip faller of all was media group Vivendi Universal which fell 23 3 per cent to {XEU}18 75 One major factor weighing on sentiment towards the stock was a doubt over the sale of its Italian pay

2002-06-26, A consortium led by Macquarie the Australian investment bank yesterday clinched a long-awaited deal to buy Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport agreeing to pay A$5 59bn US$3 2bn for Australia's largest airport in the world's biggest trade sale in the sector to date The sale price exceeded expectations and Nick Minchin finance minister said it would enable the state to retire A$4 23bn in debt Macquarie's Southern Cross consortium which also includes the airports arm of Hochtief the German construction company outbid rival groups involving Dutch bank ABN Amro and Westpac of Australia AMP the Australian insurer and BAA the UK airports group The privatisation marks the first large airport sale since the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US which forced the government to put back the timetable by 10 months Most analysts had expected a price of no more than A$5bn However Australia's aviation market is recovering more quickly than predicted while Sydney airport's growth rate is expected to continue to exceed that of most comparable world airports over the next decade The government is also removing price controls on aeronautical charges from next month On Deutsche Bank estimates Southern Cross is paying a multiple of 16 4 times earnings before interest depreciation and amortisation for the year ending this month This compares with an average price of 15 8 times historic ebitda for trade sales of airports around the world over the past five years But Macquarie said it was acquiring the airport which receives more than half of Australia's international visitors just as it was entering a growth spurt and after the significant investment it received for the Sydney Olympics Research commissioned by Southern Cross forecasts the number of international passengers at the airport will climb to close to 12m by 2006 up from less than 9m out of a total of about 23m this year It is unlikely to reach full capacity of 63m passengers until 2020 As well as the 99-year lease on Kingsford Smith Southern Cross has the right to build and operate a second Sydney airport when one becomes necessary Three Macquarie Bank funds will together hold 53 3 per cent of the consortium's equity with Ferrovial the Spanish construction group taking 20 per cent Hochtief 15 per cent and Abbey National 5 per cen,2
2002-06-15, Equity investors have removed their rose-tinted spectacles They are ignoring more optimistic forecasts from economists They no longer trust titans of industry They brush off corporate announcements indicating that profits are again rising The markets fall European equities dropped almost 5 per cent this week In the UK the FTSE 100 index fell 3 per cent yesterday And across the pond the S&P 500 index dipped below the 1000 mark bringing its decline this year close to 15 per cent Technology stocks were hit particularly hard with the Nasdaq composite almost back at its lows of last September Investors are right It matters less that economists' sentiment has improved rapidly this year than that valuation levels became divorced from reality in the late 1990s The reasons for selling shares have existed for many years but now they are gaining wider acceptance Fuelling the change in sentiment has been a loss of trust in corporate America The standing of senior executives has plummeted Many of those acclaimed as heroes as recently as last year are now regarded as little more than villains enriching themselves at the shareholders' expense The many tricks used to inflate published earnings figures attract appropriate levels of suspicion Analysts have lost their star status their conflicts of interest are no longer brushed aside If lost trust has exacerbated the fall in markets the underlying logic behind falling stock markets is simple Equities especially in the US became grossly overvalued in the euphoria of the late-1990s boom Collectively investors put aside their critical faculties in a stampede to get rich inflating the bubble As yet it has only partially deflated Price/earnings ratios are still well above their historic average Standard and Poor's the ratings agency calculates the core US p/e ratios at 41 close to an all-time peak Either profits must recover rapidly or the market may fall much further Not all gloom For all the equity gloom the world economy has exceeded expectations this year The consensus economic growth forecast for the US in 2002 has risen to 2 7 per cent from 0 9 per cent at the start of the year Japan grew at an annualised rate of 5 7 per cent in the first quarter on the back of a surge in exports Growth in the eurozone has begun to increase and in the UK activity is rising sharply after a couple of quarters of stagnation In these circumstances an optimist would expect the powerful economic forces underpinning recovery extremely low interest rates and lax fiscal policy to kick-start an equity rally But with markets falling fast in response to past excess valuations the direction of causation between the economy and equities is more likely to be in reverse Falling stock prices are likely to hamper the recovery because they further damage US consumers' fragile finances and falling confidence Spending spree The US avoided a serious recession because consumers continued to borrow and spend Saving rates remained at extremely low levels But because consumers made precious few adjustments in the downturn their financial position did not improve so the scope for rapid growth is weak Another US spending spree would simply create an even more unsustainable current account deficit and increase indebtedness and the threat of a bigger bust in years to come If consumers are unlikely to drive longer-term US growth the corporate sector seems unwilling and unable to take up the baton Unwilling because executives have learnt that the promise of enormous returns from technology investments is illusory in a competitive economy And unable because falling stock prices and corporate fragility has raised the cost of capital The necessary adjustments of the US economy are clear and have remained constant for the past few years They include a big rise in external demand to allow US households to increase their saving without causing another recessionary dip The dollar needs to decline gradually and more robust growth is required elsewhere in the world particularly in Europe That would help the US to overcome its previous excesses Unfortunately this adjustment seems less likely than two other alternatives US consumers may restore their faith in the economy's ability to defy gravity but the strains would ultimately become unbearable Or they may lose their nerve and the present market slump could result in a double-dip recession and a de-stabilising fall in the dollar This painful conclusion is the result of the excesses in the late 1990s economy Returning to reality is in the long run good for the US for investors and for the global economy The process of transition may not be pleasant ,2
2002-06-04, BHP adds trio to mining trust fund BHP Billiton has appointed three prominent Australians to the board of the Singapore-based trust fund that will administer its share of dividends from the controversial Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea The Anglo-Australian mining group is placing its 52 per cent stake in the mine which has caused extensive environmental damage into a holding company that will accumulate funds to settle any further damages claims and distribute funding for development projects in the impoverished island state Ross Garnaut professor of economics at the Australian National University and chairman of Lihir Gold another PNG mining group is to be chairman of the PNG Sustainable Development Programme Company He will be joined on the board by Jim Carlton secretary- general of Red Cross Australia and a former federal health minister and Tricia Caswell former executive director of the Australian Conservation Foundation an environmental group Garnaut said most of the funding would be directed to PNG's western province where Ok Tedi one of the world's largest copper and gold mines is located Environmental groups have campaigned against the mine for years but the government has resisted closing it early because of its importance to the national economy The board of the development fund will have four other members three of whom are to be nominated by PNG institutions while the fourth will be based in Singapore Virginia Marsh,1
2002-06-10, Elan the embattled Irish group will today announce plans to axe a substantial part of its workforce after abandoning its ambition to become a broad-based pharmaceuticals concern The company under fire over accounting practices is to end much of its research and development and rationalise its manufacturing in an effort to repair its balance sheet Elan will today provide details on a far-reaching restructuring It is also expected to announce plans to increase the role of independent directors as part of a board shake-up led by Dick Thornburg a non-executive director and former US attorney-general Mr Thornburg is to head a new nominations committee and take on greater powers to supervise executives Donal Geaney chairman and chief executive and Tom Lynch chief financial officer who have been under pressure to resign are expected to survive the shake-up which will see more heavyweight non-executives appointed Mr Geaney told the Financial Times last week that he did not expect to hold on to his job if the restructuring failed to restore investor confidence within six months Elan is to abandon oncology dermatology and acute care to focus on just two areas pain management and neurology It will close about 16 of its 32 business locations including manufacturing plants in Switzerland and Italy Many of the investments Elan is to unwind over the next six months were part of its strategy to move from being a provider of R&D services to other pharmaceutical companies to being a sales-oriented drugs group The financing mechanisms that we used    have put us in the position that we have an overcomplicated balance sheet Our ambition is to make 90 per cent of revenues from market products Mr Geaney said The group will unwind many of its 55 joint ventures It hopes to raise $150m this year by selling non-core holdings However analysts say they have lost about 38 per cent of their value this year as investors have exited high risk sectors The disposals are likely to hit Elan's partners which include Teva Israel's leading pharmaceuticals group Isis and Ligand Elan shares have lost 90 per cent of their value this year since it admitted profits would have been lower last year if it had included two off-balance sheet vehicles used to fund R&D It also suffered the loss of one of its most promising potential medicines after a much vaunted vaccine against Alzheimer's disease was linked with dangerous side-effects Elan's web of 55 joint ventures led to comparisons with Enron the failed US energy group and triggered a US investigation into its accounting methods Elan denies any wrongdoing In areport issued last Thursday Credit Suisse First Boston said it was still not clear if Elan actually made any money last year ,2
2002-04-26, The perception that the banking sector is the only secure bolt-hole for investors intensified yesterday The drugs sector became the latest to produce shock news following in the footsteps of the oil and telecom sectors AstraZeneca which had been trading around its peak plunged 277p at worst after it announced a delay to the US approval of Crestor its new cholesterol treatment and a potential blockbuster The US Food and Drug Administration had been expected to respond to the drug's marketing application by today's deadline but told the company it was unlikely to respond until the end of June AstraZeneca said that meant the planned third-quarter launch was unlikely However the shares recovered a third of their losses to close 187 lower at £33 40 after analysts said they had been oversold The analysts pointed to figures showing a strong first quarter and a rise in the company's earnings growth expectations for the full year Merrill Lynch said the withdrawal of Bayer's rival Baycol drug and the FDA's recent record of delayed approvals meant a setback to the launch timetable was on the cards It said a Crestor delay of a few months would not afflict the long-term potential of the drug provided the label was not restrictive The telecom sector offered a daunting switchback ride yesterday with Vodafone sliding 7 per cent in the morning to nudge 100p a share before recovering to close as the day's best performer in the Footsie with a rise of 5{1/4} to 112{3/4}p The fierce swing was backed by unusually high turnover even by the standards of the UK's most heavily traded stock By the end of the session more than 830m shares had been exchanged The initial slide was prompted by the release of a disappointing set of key performance indicators Mixed reaction However the shares rallied through the day as some influential broker recommendations kicked in Initial broker reaction was mixed with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney upgraded its rating for Vodafone to buy from outperform with a 160p target price and said it would be a mistake to be too pessimistic about how Vodafone could deal with the industry's product and technology cycle challenges Deutsche Bank pushed its strong buy and 180p target and ABN Amro retained its add with a fundamental value of 150p However Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein placed its buy rating for Vodafone under downwards review following the data release Meanwhile MMO{2} the mobile group spun off from BT was one of the worst performers in the main index after Collins Stewart said MMO{2} was worthless in its current form but if the group closed its loss-making German business the valuation would rise to 24p 50 per cent below yesterday's opening level The shares were off 6{1/2} at worst but closed 2{1/2} lower at 47{1/2}p with the company's advisers keen to point out that the consensus market share price forecast was more like 85p-90p Lower down the sector pecking order Alphyra the software group lifted 7{1/2} to 177{1/2}p after its German subsidiary secured a {XEU}9m £6 2m contract to deliver top-up services for one of the two leading mobile phone operators in the country The oil sector continued to be weak in spite of an upgrade by Lehman Brothers to its oil price forecast but banks were selectively stronger Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland retreated slightly from their highs but Lloyds TSB rose 7{1/2} to 786{1/2}p HBOS 3{1/2} to 831p and HSBC 2{1/2} to 820p Software group Autonomy was the strongest performer in the midcap index on the back of first-quarter earnings slightly above market expectations Goldman Sachs said the operating margin was better than it had expected at 19 5 per cent against expectations of 2 9 per cent because of better cost management This led Goldman to believe the shares could rally towards the higher end of the recent trading range of 400p in the short term as investors' focus shifts back to the earnings leverage in the Autonomy story However disappointment with first-quarter sales and margins saw CGNU dive 43{1/2} to 728p One analyst said quarterly new business sales should only be a modest indicator of value but they had assumed greater importance recently because of the overall weakness of equity markets  SSL advances SSL International maker of condoms and household gloves improved 10 to 435p as Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein upgraded its recommendation to buy from add and said recent selling had been overdone The shares had also been boosted by speculation of a bid from Johnson & Johnson of the US Shire Pharmaceuticals gained 20 to 522p Williams de Broe upgraded it to buy from hold saying it was undervalued in comparison with the sector News that Oxford Glycosciences had suspended clinical trials of its Vevesca drug after a patient developed neurological problems saw the shares slide 22{1/2} to 332{1/2}p Mersey Docks & Harbour lifted 6 to 559{1/2}p ABN Amro reiterated a buy stance after Wednesday's trading statement Invensys announced it had secured a $1 39bn loan with its banks to give it room to sell assets and refinance its balance sheet but the market remained concerned Although the new credit line is thought to remove the immediate refinancing risk over the group's £950m credit line maturing in August 2002 the shares closed a net 4{1/2} off at 107p The fall reflected concerns that the loan was agreed at about 175 basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate a junk rating suggesting Invensys negotiated the terms on a weakened footing and which prompted doubt about the success of management plans to end its debt via asset sales Dairy Crest the food manufacturer continued its ascent rising another 6{1/2} to reach a five-year high of 514{1/2}p albeit

2002-06-13, With Japan's corporate earnings season now closed the country's once-mighty corporate titans have surprised investors not with their technical wizardry or market conquests but with the scale of losses they suffered last year NTT the telecommunications group made the largest loss to date by a Japanese non-financial company Y812bn £4 5bn But it was not alone The electronics industry is awash with red ink as are the banking property development and construction sectors The wave of losses isa reminder of the extent to which the world's second largest economy has been weakened Last year 1057 Japanese companies included in the Topix index excluding financials made an aggregate net loss the first time this has happened since consolidated accounting began in the early 1980s says Garry Evans chief strategist at HSBC Securities in Tokyo The aggregate net loss came to Y900bn At the operating profit level the aggregate decline was 23 per cent the sharpest fall by Japanese companies since the 1970s says Mr Evans To some extent the losses reflect cyclical problems that have affected companies globally The integrated electronics groups for example were hit by the technology downturn particularly in semiconductors and liquid crystal displays where sharp price declines slashed profits NEC's electronic devices division for example incurred an operating loss of Y148bn The group's decision announced last month to spin off its semiconductor division one of its core businesses highlights the extent of the pain In the second half of last year orders for telecoms equipment all but dried up says Koji Nishigaki president Neither were Japanese technology companies immune to the bursting of the telecoms and technology bubble NTT's loss stemmed in large part from its overseas forays which cost it Y1407bn in write-offs of investments in a web-hosting company in the US and mobile telecoms operators elsewhere Of greater concern is that the losses also stem from structural problems and the failure of many companies to restructure their operations aggressively Structural problems and lack of focus greatly aggravated the situation says Scott Foster analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo Consequently while last year's losses reflect heavy restructuring charges the over capacity and high labour costs that have hurt Japan's corporate competitiveness continue in many sectors Daiei the troubled retailer still has 40 loss-making stores that together lost more than Y10bn Jeffrey Young economist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo says companies have been slow to cut capacity even though demand growth has radically contracted To add to these woes many companies still have balance sheet issues that they have yet to deal with Mr Evans estimates corporations have between Y5000bn and Y10000bn of unrealised losses on real estate holdings There are plenty of further write-offs to be taken he says adding that extraordinary losses are going to be a big number for some years to come The picture is not all black Some companies made record profits including Toyota Ricoh and Fujisawa the pharmaceuticals group But many of these benefited from the weak yen For companies across a broad range of sectors the sharp deterioration in profitability and the need for additional restructuring will continue to damage their competitiveness The return of the Japanese corporate juggernaut is still a long way off Shadow management Page 14 Mizuho criticised Page 31 www ft com/asiapacific,1

2002-06-14, A group of bondholders have written to Colt Telecom urging the telecommunications company to end its recent spate of bond buy-backs and conserve cash Colt said it had received a letter this week from Linklaters the London law firm on behalf of a group of bondholders It is understood that the bondholders claim the bond buy-backs constitute preferential treatment for certain creditors in light of lingering questions over Colt's long-term funding position Since August Colt has spent £147m of cash buying back bonds with a face value of £270m The bondholders fear Colt's repurchases may weaken its financial strength and have asked to be involved in any further restructuring of the company's balance sheet The letter is the latest example of bondholders' increased assertiveness in defending their interests in the turbulent telecoms sector Bondholders have previously appointed lawyers and organised themselves into committees when dealing with the collapse of Atlantic Telecom and debt restructurings at Energis Marconi and Telewest Colt insists last year's £494m share issue and a £200m reduction in capital expenditure should dispel any concerns about its ability to fund itself through to cash flow break-even during 2005 News of the bondholder's letter emerged as Colt appointed two Fidelity directors as its new chairman and interim finance director Barry Bateman Fidelity's vice chairman will succeed James Curvey when he steps down as chairman at the end of the year ,1
2002-04-17, Chipmakers are all agreed on one thing they are glad 2001 is over Last year was the worst year ever for the global chip industry as revenues plunged by 32 per cent or a stunning $66bn to $139bn This compared with record sales of $205bn in 2000 Furthermore the decline was almost twice that of the second-worst year 1985 when the market fell by about 17 per cent Semiconductor companies last year had to shift into an abrupt reversal from trying to expand production to slashing costs and scaling back output fast enough to keep up with the incredibly rapid drop in demand Industry veterans were astounded at the speed of the fall in demand in 2001 And some Wall Street analysts using a twisted logic upgraded the sector in mid-2001 on the basis that business was so bad it could only get better A rally in chip stocks seemed to occur every two months as analysts yet again concluded that the lowest point had been reached Yet the horrible market conditions continued with the sector bouncing along the bottom as large chip inventories contributed to a glut of chips in the face of startlingly weak demand Even in December of 2001 sales were down 43 per cent to $10 2bn compared with $17 9bn a year earlier and declined 4 per cent on a sequential basis The large decline last year was due to a confluence of three factors creating what some analysts called a perfect storm The PC market a long-time driver for chip markets has been joined in recent years by consumer electronics and communications equipment as the three chief chip customers This reliance on three separate markets was at first viewed as a good thing by the Semiconductor Industry Association SIA the industry trade group This was because a downturn in one sector might be balanced by robust demand from the other two However in 2001 all three declined exacerbating the downturn In 2002 there is a glimmer of hope Demand in PCs is better than expected and consumer electronics is also good says Doug Andrey the chief economist at the SIA The trade group is predicting a modest 6 per cent increase this year with most of the increase occurring in the second half of the year The stronger-than-expected PC demand in the first quarter of this year has helped to buoy Intel the largest PC microprocessor company But the biggest beneficiaries of the stronger PC market have been the leading memory chip makers Samsung Electronics in South Korea Micron Technology in the US and Infineon Technologies in Europe The prices of some memory chips have more than quadrupled over the past six months which is good news because a glut of memory chips had depressed prices to below the cost of manufacture The dynamics of the memory chip market have also led to consolidation in this sector Micron Technology has made a bid for the top spot with its acquisition of Toshiba's memory chip operations and its goal of acquiring the memory chip business of struggling Hynix of South Korea The laggard in the semiconductor sector is chips for communications equipment and devices such as cell phones But even here there are some positive signs says Fred Shlapak head of Motorola's chip group which is a leading supplier of communications chips Customer inventories are down and we are seeing a respectable improvement in demand that will grow towards the end of the year  In communications chips the wireless sector is still lagging but Texas Instruments recently said it had experienced a sequential rise in demand One of the problems in this sector is that the telecommunications companies have cut back on their capital expenditure budgets as the capital supply has tightened and they are trying to generate revenues from their existing investments Similarly chipmakers have drastically reduced their capital expenditure this year Intel for example reduced its capital expenditure to $5 5bn from a record $7 3bn last year and $6 8bn in 2000 Motorola has made even more drastic cuts Our capital expenditure budget this year is $200m two years ago it was $2 4bn says Mr Shlapak Texas Instruments has cut its budget to $800m this year from $1 8bn last year James Morgan the head of Applied Materials the world's largest supplier of chip manufacturing equipment says that the levels of capital expenditure are too low There is significant under-investment in all sectors of the chip market  This trend could lead to chip shortages when demand does return since it can take up to three years to bring additional chip manufacturing lines into full production However chip shortages always mean higher prices and profits which in this market would be very welcome The problem is that if a chipmaker's rival has timed their capital investments right it can pick up the extra business and move ahead Timing chip fabrication investments is an essential skill for semiconductor manufacturers With the price tag of advanced chip fabrication plants or fabs approaching the $3bn mark tying up that much capital in production lines that are not operating at full capacity is incredibly expensive Much of Intel's investment has been in 300mm wafer fabs These use silicon wafers that are twice the size of the 200mm wafers used in most fabs and thus allow more chips to be made from each wafer But 300mm fabs require a very large investment and not all companies are able to justify building such expensive plants We have no plans for a 300mm fab says Motorola's Mr Shlapak I could not fill one up even if I had one  Motorola along with many other chipmakers is either turning to joint ventures with others or planning to use foundries This is part of a larger trend Foundries make chips for other companies in the same way electronics manufacturing has been outsourced Foundries used to have a poor reputation for using older and less-efficient technologies but these days they are considered to be at the cutting edge of chip manufacturing techniques And since they can take orders from many different customers they can ensure that their production lines are full The foundries in Taiwan and Singapore dominate this sector But China-based foundries are the future There is a tremendous amount of investment in Chinese foundries notes Mr Morgan Foundries now account for about one-fifth of all chips made from about 8 per cent five years ago And the trend is to use foundries for more products especially commodity-type chips allowing chipmakers to keep control over the production of higher-margin components While the short-term prospects for the chip industry are hard to gauge over the long-term there are tremendous business opportunities The industry has consistently recorded a 17 per cent compound annual growth rate for the last 40 years The development of faster and more powerful chips is set to continue following what is known as Moore's law the doubling of chip performance every 18 to 24 months But within about five years new types of chipmaking techniques will be required Developments in advanced lithographic techniques and new types of materials that allow the etching of extremely small circuits should allow Moore's law to remain in force for at least another decade Despite the industry's travails it has kept an eye on the future Innovation is still flourishing in large and small companies Earlier this year for example Silicon Valley-based Infinera revealed what is claimed to be the world's first integrated photonic chip its circuits control the flow of light rather than electrons And last year's problem markets could become hot properties in years to come While 2001 has been the worst year ever for the industry start-ups continue to emerge while some companies continue to invest in wireless data networking and wireless interactivity says Mary Olsson chief analyst for Gartner Dataquest's semiconductor industry management group These markets will become the growth drivers during the next five years and beyond  More on the web a range of

2002-04-24, Deutsche Telekom the German telecommunication operator yesterday said VoiceStream it US mobile telephony arm had returned its first quarterly profit this year quashing rumours that the unit would be put up for sale But the news failed to prevent shares in DT from dropping 6 cents or 0 4 per cent to {XEU}16 54 in late trading as Ron Sommer chief executive unveiled another rise in the group's already formidable debt pile Net debt stood at {XEU}67 2bn $59bn at the end of March an 8 per cent increase from its December 31 level mainly due to the acquisition of outstanding shares in Debis Systemhaus a information technology services subsidiary that is now fully owned  Analysts said the market's reaction had less to do with the figure than with the lack of information as to how the group intended to reach its objective of cutting debt to {XEU}50bn by the end of 2003 The cornerstones of DT's debt-reduction plan the sale of six cable television businesses and an initial public offering of its T-Mobile subsidiary are not expected to be concluded this year Mr Sommer and Karl-Gerhard Eick finance director dismissed rumours that DT was considering an auction of VoiceStream acquired for $26bn last June Speaking at the group's annual press conference Mr Eick said such a move towards cutting leverage was not a topic at the moment Instead as already announced he said the group would cut capital expenditure by {XEU}1bn this year drop its dividend payment by half sell property assets and tap an expected free cash flow of up to {XEU}1 5bn to trim debt Some US analysts had hoped that a sale of Voice-Stream the country's smallest mobile operator would trigger a consolidation of the sector DT said VoiceStream had earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation of {XEU}106m in the first quarter of the year against a {XEU}71m loss in the previous quarter It gained half a million new subscribers in the same period The group as a whole which will report detailed quarterly results in May was expected to show a 16 per cent rise in sales to {XEU}12 9bn in the first three months with a single digit increase in ebitda earnings Mr Eick said DT was sticking to its target of a 10 per cent rise in revenue for 2002 and that earnings growth would pick up in the coming quarters He said he was comfortable with analysts' estimates of ebitda earnings of {XEU}15 9bn-{XEU}16 9bn But in spite of improvement at the operating level VoiceStream will keep weighing on the group's bottom line Mr Eick said amortisation of goodwill and licences most of which related to the US unit would rise from {XEU}4bn to {XEU}5 6bn in 2002 Last year DT reported a {XEU}3 5bn net loss its first since its 1996 IPO See Lex,2
2002-06-28, The current wisdom on Wall Street is that energy companies' electricity trading operations are worth nothing at best At worst they are sumps of accounting fraud and lawsuit magnets that represent negative value for shareholders Even though far more money has been lost on telecommunications stocks and bonds energy executives are the bad guys of the market You might think from Jeffrey Skilling's bad guy impersonation that his former colleagues and their industry counterparts have a public be damned attitude when it comes to their image You would be wrong I spent some time at a gathering of energy traders and found they were deeply unhappy with the public opprobrium Some doubted their industry could survive You can see the reasoning Staff cut-backs at the merchant energy companies particularly in the trading operations are frequently in the 20 to 30 per cent range Senator Dianne Feinstein's bill to reregulate energy derivatives under the Commodities Futures Trading Commission may come up for a vote next month and its chances of passage are looking good In the western states public power agencies and their political advocates are looking at building new capacity or buying existing plants for their own balance sheets rather than depending on purchases of power in the merchant electricity market But in a contrarian signal some big banks and investment dealers are looking over the crop of energy traders working their resumes Given Wall Street's problems these days with legal exposure to the backwash from the 1990s it is interesting that some traders are looking at ways they might expand rather than contract their energy exposure Here is a chance for the energy trading industry to ensure its survival The fundamental problem is that rating agencies and the buy side of the credit community are demanding that energy companies sell off assets to reduce leverage raise cash and get their bonds back to an investment-grade rating Since every company but Duke and AEP are subject to these demands one wonders who will be buying the assets They can't all take in one another's washing after all that was last quarter's game Up to now many of the asset sales that energy companies have undertaken have been to master limited partnerships they have organised But that is not an infinitely expandable market Furthermore it would be a waste of expensive equity capital for all the energy traders to get investment-grade status The only reason energy firms need more equity is to ensure that they will be acceptable counterparties for the companies with which they trade The way around this is to trade through a clearing house that either has plenty of equity capital or recourse to the Federal Reserve for liquidity A clearing house is the seller to all buyers and the buyer for all sellers That's how the commodities exchanges work Their clearing operations are backed by banks which are in turn backed by the Fed They ensure they are not at risk by demanding original and variation margins appropriate for a particular contract and type of counterparty I once worked for a commodities brokerage firm and I can tell you that the customer base could have been mistaken for the clientele of a smugglers' bar on the Macao waterfront As such we double-checked all the information about our customers Customers of the commodities exchanges have very rarely if ever lost money because of counterparty credit problems The exchanges in New York and Chicago would be perfectly happy to take over the function of the energy traders Unfortunately their contracts are too inflexible to serve the electricity market's purposes Electricity's price varies too much from one local market to another transmission charges and capacity can be as significant as the price of gas and power generation and contracts need to be longer term than what is available on an exchange The real value from energy trading is in putting together custom-designed structured trades The solution is to combine the best aspects of the over-the-counter dealer markets and the exchanges A consortium of banks and possibly a large insurer or two could provide the balance sheet and risk management needed to act as a clearing house Since they're operating the casino rather than gambling in it their own capital should be safe The traders and the local distribution companies would have the assurance that the contracts would be good and could therefore focus on coming up with the most efficient contract structures The availability of the markets as a hedging vehicle would lend stability to borrowing for new electricity generation The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission could be the overseers and auditors ,1
2002-04-19, After a dreadful time during the past three years Corus may be approaching calmer waters The Anglo-Dutch steel-maker formed from a merger between British Steel and Hoogovens in 1999 is hoping to reap the benefit this year and next from what many expect to be a slow but steady pick-up in demand in the global steel industry While the world's fifth biggest steelmaker made a pre-tax loss of £462m last year and is expected to do little more than break even this year analysts are far more optimistic about its performance next year As steel prices improve Corus could see a big jump in pre-tax profits in 2003 to £500m-£750m according to some analysts And because of optimism among investors the shares have outperformed the rest of the UK stock market by 100 per cent since last autumn propelling Corus back into the FTSE 100 from which it was ejected 18 months ago Last night the shares closed at 87{1/4}p compared with 44p six months ago The signs of an upturn have come after a series of traumas The company's UK steelmaking operations plunged into heavy losses mainly as a result of the dwindling demand for steel from British manufacturers combined with the impact of the strength of the pound against the euro As a result the whole of the company made a £1 1bn pre-tax loss in 2000 Its two former joint chief executives one British and one Dutch were eased out in December 2000 amid accusations that they had not been doing enough to get the company into shape In an effort to improve performance 10000 jobs have been cut from Corus's UK operations in the past two years Even though Tony Pedder Corus's chief executive since September is fairly upbeat about the rest of the year he is careful to sound a note of caution I would not want to give the impression that the corner has been turned there's still a lot that can go wrong he says One of the reasons for Mr Pedder's concern is the US action to curb steel imports with prohibitive tariffs in an effort to put the struggling domestic steel industry back on its feet The controls could lead to a glut of steel in other parts of the world as supplies that would have gone to North America are diverted elsewhere holding back the expected recovery in prices this year from close to 20-year lows However Mr Pedder has been heartened by a rapid decision by the European Union to introduce its own controls on steel imports into Europe where Corus sells most of its steel so reducing the possibility of sudden surges in supplies that could push down prices It is unsatisfactory to have markets propped up by government trade constraints argues Mr Pedder But assuming that the EU's controls bite he says It is conceivable we will see a stronger increase in prices later this year than some expect  He also hopes that the US government will agree to exempt from its tariffs a large proportion of the 900000 tonnes of steel that the company would normally expect to export there this year Discussions between the US and UK governments over this are expected to continue over the next few weeks and Corus managers will raise the topic in a meeting with Patricia Hewitt the UK industry secretary during a visit she is making to the company's engineering-steels plant in Rotherham south Yorkshire today Corus recently announced that it was looking for buyers for its small aluminium division formerly part of Hoogovens and which accounted for 14 per cent of its £7 7bn sales last year By raising about £800m the disposal would reduce Corus's debts and enable the company to focus more on steel The move is applauded as sensible by most steel analysts Duncan McLean of Goldman Sachs says The company has had a difficult time but seems to be doing the right things  Looking further ahead Mr Pedder realises that he may eventually have to deal with a structural problem concerning the company's production Even with the job reductions in the UK and a cut in its British steelmaking capacity by a fifth the company may still have too much of its manufacturing too far from its most promising markets Of the 18m tonnes of steel it produced last year 12m came from the UK of which roughly half was exported The other 6m tonnes came principally from a large steel plant run by Corus in IJmuiden in the Netherlands and which mainly serves customers in continental Europe With such a large proportion of its customers outside Britain it would probably make sense for the company to build up more production capacity outside the UK in the longer term While Corus is interested in expanding IJmuiden Mr Pedder also says the company may be ready to look at opportunities for making steel in other regions outside the UK such as in eastern Europe should prospects for the steel industry improve As Corus gears up for a likely upturn the betting is that over the next few years the company will continue to push its focus further from the UK ,1
2002-06-13, The privatisation of Gaz de France the state gas company to be floated after this weekend's general election could be delayed by problems in unravelling its ties with Electricite de France according to French officials GdF is expected to be among the first groups prepared for sale by a new government after Sunday's poll although the state will probably retain a majority stake Analysts at CAI Cheuvreux estimate that GdF is worth {XEU}5bn to {XEU}8bn An offering would be a useful bonus for a government that will be struggling to balance its budget in the next two years in line with the eurozone stability pact GdF this week unveiled a streamlined management structure as it prepares for privatisation and further energy market liberalisation But EdF has warned privately that GdF is being over-enthusiastic saying it will be difficult to separate quickly the 73000 staff in France who work as joint service agents for EdF and GdF Because it is bigger EdF is reckoned to be responsible for about three-quarters of the French service staff The two groups also share information technology and billing systems in France but the processing of unravelling them is under way EdF recommends privatising both groups at the same time This could accelerate the privatisation of EdF valued at about {XEU}80bn but hinder the rapid flotation of GdF whose strategic adviser is Societe Generale Investment bankers have been eagerly courting both GdF and EdF Privatisations are one of the biggest fee earners for bankers and everyone will be fighting to be part of the action said one senior investment banker yesterday Typical merger and acquisition fees are between 0 5 per cent and 1 per cent of the value of the target But with privatisations banks are usually paid between 1 4 per cent and 1 8 per cent of the value of a retail offering Banks have recently earned good fees from the flotation of Autoroutes du Sud de la France the motorways operator and the sale of 1 5bn of shares in Renault However GdF and EdF will have to overcome several obstacles before their shares can be sold to investors First the new government expected to be a rightwing administration loyal to President Jacques Chirac must take a political decision in the face of inevitable protests from trade unions The National Assembly must then pass legislation to convert the groups into public companies and the company accounts must be brought into line with private sector norms Another issue is the need to clarify the systems under which state companies pay pensions to past and present employees EdF also has the unquantified cost of decommissioning its nuclear power plants and the fate of its spent nuclear fuel Last stand at polls Page 2 www ft com/energy,1
2002-06-24, WorldCom is set to lose access to a $3 75bn credit facility that expires this week before it has secured a new $5bn facility to put in its place However while the delay to the new bank loan added to a new round of jitters last week about the struggling US telecommunications company's finances WorldCom denied that negotiations over the new loan had run into difficulties Meanwhile John Sigmore who replaced Bernie Ebbers as chief executive officer in April is due this week to deliver the results of a wide- ranging strategic review of the company that may include the loss of as many as 16000 jobs Mr Sigmore has said that despite WorldCom's financial difficulties he is determined not to scale back the company's operations with the greatest long-term growth potential including its international business However Mr Sigmore's most recent efforts to conserve cash including a decision last week to suspend payments on preferred stock issued by WorldCom's MCI unit have prompted new ratings downgrades and fresh concerns that the company will have to take drastic steps to stay afloat Bob Ray an analyst at Moody's Investors Service said that there's nothing unusual about the length of the bank negotiations even though WorldCom had said earlier that it would complete the new $5bn bank loan by the end of June WorldCom said it had wanted to put the deal behind it before an existing facility expired The company has already put pressure on its bankers to agree to the new loan by drawing down an existing credit facility The new loan which would give banks security and carry higher interest rates would replace the existing facility and another current loan while also including around $700m of new money from the banks The company has said that its three lead bankers have promised to put up $400m of this money leaving some $300m still to be found from other banks ,1

2002-04-26, Ecuador's finance minister moved a significant step closer to signing a fresh loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund after negotiations in Washington concluded a draft accord Carlos Julio Emanuel wants a 12-month stand-by loan worth $240m £166m to $300m to follow Ecuador's completion of an IMF deal last December A lack of consensus between the fund and the government over the need to run a small fiscal surplus had proved a stumbling block There was progress towards reaching an agreement although there are still a number of prior actions to be completed said the IMF An agreement which would pave the way for other multilateral funding is seen as crucial for the medium-term management of the Andean nation's dollar-based economy Ecuador also needs a stamp of approval from the IMF to smooth the way for a new administration when president Gustavo Noboa finishes his term of office in December Growth in 2002 has been revised upwards to 4 1 per cent in 2002 The president still needs to win congressional approval for fiscal reform in an acceptable form Reforms need to give priority to saving over spending of the country's oil revenues and promote a budget to create stability in the medium-term said an official close to the government's economic team The IMF would like Ecuador to move towards stabilising and reducing debt as well as improving transparency and public disclosure of its accounts The fund also wants the Paris Club of official government creditors to confirm that Ecuador has cleared its payment arrears ,2

2002-04-29, This week one of Britain's eccentric minority sports takes place local election voting We can expect the number of hardy souls participating in this quaint tradition to drop to fewer than one in five eligible voters It all seems a far cry from the heady rhetoric of New Labour's first term In 1998 Tony Blair wrote a pamphlet making the case for radical reform of local government Councils were to be rewarded with new roles and responsibilities if they dealt with their poor record of public service performance weak accountability and bankrupt politics The government brought forward two important pieces of legislation and countless departmental initiatives to kick-start the process Five years on it seems that the widespread apathy and lack of interest that characterise local politics are evidence that things have got worse not better Local election campaigns remain a large and expensive opinion poll on the performance of central government The chancellor's recent Budget revealed just how little has really changed between central and local government in the past five years The Budget announced that councils would be fined if they failed to provide elderly patients with access to residential care as soon as the patients were ready to be discharged from hospital Regardless of whether the policy is fair effective or even implemented the initiative is an indictment of the cumulative failure of Labour's agenda for reforming local government Ministers are no closer to trusting local government as an effective institution The residential care policy was announced as a fait accompli The first the Local Government Association heard about it was a report in this newspaper two days before the Budget Ministers do not take local government its representative institutions or its concerns seriously Nevertheless the government's enthusiasm for all things technocratic and managerial has led to a new wheeze of inspections and league tables to motivate local government Local authorities are to be divided into four categories high-performing striving coasting and poor-performing with the promise of new freedoms and powers linked to league status Language aside imagine being a poor-performing council and announcing to your electorate that your ambition is to join the coasters there is little evidence that these new freedoms and powers will capture the electorate's imagination Marginal tax-raising powers have been kicked into the long grass via a government task force The Department for Transport Local Government and the Regions has so far been unable to negotiate effectively with other departments which are unwilling to deviate from their narrow agendas However this year's local government elections on May 2 will have one important difference from previous polls Seven areas as diverse as Doncaster Newham and Watford will for the first time be able directly to elect a mayor Elected mayors were the government's only big idea for local government reform back in 1997 US-style executive mayors were designed to spearhead the creation of a leadership cadre that could connect with public aspirations legitimise local elections and cut a swath through council bureaucracy Already these seven individual election contests have attracted much more attention than the rest of the local government elections combined They are creating a focus on local issues Candidates such as Ray Mallon the former police inspector in Middlesbrough have become lightning rods for local concerns such as rising levels of crime Mr Mallon who pioneered the UK version of zero tolerance policing is likely to push Sylvia Connolly the Labour candidate into second place However out of the 150 principal local authorities in England and Wales only 23 referendums have been held to date on the question of whether to have an elected mayor Not a single referendum has taken place in core cities such as Liverpool and Birmingham for which the elected mayor system was designed Millions of citizens have been deprived of a chance to choose how they are governed The local established political elite has decided that no change is the only option and the government is turning a blind eye The reason for this is simple To deliver a substantial shift in the calibre of local political leadership national politicians would need to take decisions that party activists and trade unions would find unpalatable It is here that the politics of party come first and the country second Local councils escape the reforming zeal of the prime minister not because he is sympathetic to their plight but because in the great scheme of things most backbench Labour MPs are more likely to get agitated about fox-hunting The writer is executive director of New Local Government Network,3
1998-04-02, A sharp recovery in Orange ahead of the company's trading update today was seen as providing relief to hard-pressed traders at SBC Warburg Dillon Read The broker was left holding 52 5m shares a near 4 4 per cent stake after Warburg bought 193m shares for £763 8m last Wednesday night from British Aerospace the aerospace group which is selling non-core assets The deal was struck at 395{3/4}p adiscount to Orange's Wednesday closing price of 418{1/2}p However as Warburg started selling the underlying price was hit by overall market weakness and slipped below the commercial cut-off point Yesterday however the latest subscriber numbers from One-2-One and Vodafone came in well above consensus forecasts leading to hopes that Orange will be equally positive today And while there were some niggles that the boost might reflect an increase in the less lucrative pre-paid market the upshot was that Orange topped the Footsie with a rise of 25{1/2} to 406p The turnover of only 3 3m shares suggested Warburg was still holding the stock but dealers said it was likely the holding had been hedged in the derivatives market at the time the original deal was struck Meanwhile Vodafone added 3{1/2} at 628{1/2}p but Cable & Wireless which ownsOne-2-One was flat at 747p restrained by weakness in the Hang Seng index BT rose 21 to 671p Positive comment from Deutsche Morgan Grenfell on J Sainsbury coupled with a lengthy research report helped the shares achieve one of the better performances in the Footsie as they gained 16{3/4} to 530p The broker focused on the retailer's US operations where Sainsbury is expected to make substantial investment during the next three years Sainsbury is expected to achieve returns on capital of at least 10 per cent in the US DMG said it also expected an improvement in returns in the UK market and retained its price target of 700p for the shares ,2
2002-04-16, Wim Kok today enters his last month as Dutch prime minister with his party facing post-election desertion by its main coalition partner and his government wracked by having to re-live its worst trauma the deaths in Srebrenica of the 7000 civilians Dutch troops were supposed to protect So beset is he by political difficulties that the stellar economic record of his centre-left administration and his own international influence as the longest serving among European Union leaders have both been eclipsed It is not certain whether he will see out his term By yesterday two ministers let it be known that they were considering resigning over a deeply critical study released last week into The Hague's handling of its Yugoslav peacekeeping role The cabinet was said to have adopted the position that the departure of any one member would require a resignation en bloc Hans Dijkstal who as leader of the liberal VVD is a premiership hopeful has meanwhile made clear he wants the general election on May 15 to mark the end of nearly eight years during which his party has backed Mr Kok's social democratic PvdA Mr Dijkstal said the two could not together resolve issues ahead such as social security and asylum policy Yesterday Jan Pronk environment minister and a PvdA veteran joined Frank de Grave the VVD's defence minister in signalling his readiness to quit over the 1995 slaughter in the Bosnian Muslim enclave Ahead of further cabinet deliberations this week Mr Kok acknowledging that he too had thought in the past of resigning over the affair told public television that in this collective soul-searching the whole range of considerations have their place including the most severe Mr de Grave although given the defence post three years after the massacre regards himself as responsible for decisions made by his predecessors The report commissioned by the government from war historians spoke of a continuing cover-up culture among the senior officers who report to him Mr Pronk was development co-operation minister at the time If either man leaves it would be difficult for the prime minister as the only remaining cabinet member directly involved in deploying the battalion to hang on Under that scenario Queen Beatrix could ask all to remain in a caretaker capacity until the elections are held and a new coalition formed But some including Mr Kok may choose to clear their desks immediately Mr Kok was deputy premier under Ruud Lubbers now United Nations high commissioner for refugees in the previous coalition that nine years ago committed the lightly armed troops to the UN force in Bosnia The report says it sent the soldiers on an ill-conceived and virtually impossible mission Mr Kok has had to play a bigger role than planned in the election campaign Ad Melkert his chosen successor as PvdA leader does not enthuse voters and has had difficulty in keeping the party together The handover came as Pim Fortuyn a rightwing writer launched a populist movement that rapidly rose to rival the big established parties Although a halt to immigration is the main element of his programme Mr Fortuyn has also struck a chord by criticising shortcomings in public services such as transport education and healthcare The three-party coalition which also includes the dwindling D66 had been happy to be judged on its economic achievements But it is finding these overlooked by an electorate whose disaffection stems in part from ministers' past lack of willingness to resign when things have gone wrong Mr Kok this month handed parliament a 20-page account of his government's record It had eliminated the budget deficit and cut public debt faster than elsewhere in the EU while producing higher economic growth Unemployment had more than halved and the number of households living on close to the social minimum had fallen by nearly a third Despite this it appears the same combination will not form the next government Both main parties are courting the Christian Democrats whom Mr Kok pushed into opposition in 1994 So far only Mr Fortuyn has called for the premier to go early Opposition parties are awaiting the cabinet's response ahead of a lower house debate next week That final big parliamentary event for Mr Kok is likely to be among the most gruelling of his 16 years in elected office if he is still there to take part ,3
2002-06-11, To judge from the frenzied debate raging across the European Union it would be easy to imagine that the EU faces an unprecedented invasion of immigrants and asylum seekers With rightwing and populist parties making large inroads in recent elections in France the Netherlands and Denmark EU leaders have placed immigration at the top of their agenda for this month's Seville summit However refugee agencies say that the uproar risks undermining people's acceptance of genuine asylum seekers many of whom are fleeing oppressive regimes and should not be confused with illegal immigrants and the ruthless criminal gangs that smuggle them The number of people seeking asylum in the EU is only just over half what it was 10 years ago when the wars in former Yugoslavia were at their height Last month the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR issued figures showing the number of people seeking political asylum in the 15-member EU last year at 384530 compared with 675460 in 1992 Last year's figure was only slightly above the 374586 average for 1992-2001 Asylum statistics are being grossly manipulated by some politicians and newspapers says Rupert Colville a UNHCR spokesman The current focus on numbers is our big concern The starting point seems to be to cut numbers at all costs That seems wrong What we need is to cut the number in the system who aren't refugees and reduce the pernicious influence of the people smugglers  Even in the UK which has sought to seize the political initiative on the issue following disruption caused by asylum seekers at the Channel tunnel applications for asylum fell last year by more than 10000 to 88300 Rather than marking an upsurge in the number seeking refuge in western Europe the past decade has brought a shift in the destinations of choice While Britain received narrowly the largest number of applications last year just ahead of Germany Germany had almost three times as many over the past decade As the events of the past months have shown the reality on the ground has little impact on the political agenda Britain recently proposed tough new measures to deport thousands of asylum seekers to France and other safe countries within days of their arrival in the UK if their initial application failed The Danish parliament has passed a controversial bill to make it harder to win asylum and cutting welfare to immigrants while Italy has introduced tough immigration laws Meanwhile Britain Spain Germany France and Italy the EU's big five have thrown their weight behind efforts to crack down on illegal immigration at the Seville summit which starts on June 21 Mr Colville welcomes the attention being given to the problem but fears that rational decision-making may be difficult in the febrile atmosphere The EU's attempts to erect barriers against illegal immigration are complicated by the fact the extent of the problem is extremely hard to quantify Some estimates put the number of people trying to enter the EU illegally every year at 500000 Many find work but pay no tax or social security contributions For many European states the fight against illegal immigration has been made more difficult by the growing recognition that Europe needs immigrant workers to plug skills gaps in the labour market and provide much-needed tax revenue to keep afloat state pension schemes creaking under the weight of an ageing population In the EU where fertility rates are falling migration has contributed 70 per cent of population growth over the past five years averaging about 700000 people per year Around 13m non-EU nationals live in the bloc Amid calls for targeted immigration to attract skilled workers a European Commission report said last month immigration could not itself offset the burden ageing populations were placing on pensions systems nor could it solve the EU's labour market problems While the EU economy would benefit from the arrival of highly skilled workers illegal immigration would do considerable harm over the longer term Where you have a lot of illegal migration   this will slow the restructuring of the economy because it provides an opportunity to use unproductive methods by lowering costs said a Commission official So the EU's mixed message is one of helping those in genuine danger and attracting skilled workers from outside the EU while slamming the door against a perceived tide of illegal immigrants I hope that in Seville we are able to take concrete decisions with a concrete timetable to send out a clear message that Europe is determined to tackle illegal immigration and establish ordered and positive migratory flows says Jose Maria Aznar the Spanish prime minister who will chair what promise to be tricky negotiations ,3
2002-04-04, Bayer's {XEU}7 3bn £4 5bn acqui-sition of the agrochemicals unit of Aventis its Franco-German rival is expected to be approved by European antitrust authorities but only after the companies agreed to substantial disposals People close to the case say the European Commission is set to clear the deal within weeks after five months of tough scrutiny that prompted Bayer to offer to dispose of important parts of the combined group with sales of more than {XEU}150m The German company is understood to have agreed to sell the US and European rights to Fipronil an Aventis insecticide considered by analysts as the jewel in the crown of the group's agrochemicals unit The disposals agreed with Brussels are also believed to include the rights to the anti-cockroach and anti-termite applications of an ingredient for some of Bayer's biggest selling insecticides Analysts believe that BASF Bayer's German rival which was outbid for Aventis Crop Science is the front-runner to buy the products to be sold The extent of the disposals will surprise some industry experts because Manfred Schneider Bayer's outgoing chairman last year said the company might not have to sell assets to win regulatory approval The proposed sales will be a blow for Bayer but highlight its willingness to complete the acquisition of high-margin agrochemicals at a time of sluggish growth in its core pharmaceuticals business The Aventis deal Bayer's biggest acquisition will more than double the German company's agrochemicals sales to about {XEU}8bn and lift it from sixth to second place in the global crop protection industry just behind Syngenta the Anglo-Swiss group Bayer's offer of disposals is believed to have convinced the Commission's competition department to clear the deal The decision still needs to be discussed with an advisory committee of the European Union's 15 member states and the 20 commissioners However both the member states and the commissioners usually endorse the opinion of their competition experts US competition authorities are also scrutinising the deal People close to the discussions said the two regulators had co-operated closely on the Bayer-Aventis deal a sign that the US watchdogs could also clear the deal Bayer and the Commission declined to comment Fipronil is one of Aventis's newest and fastest growing products with total sales of {XEU}302m last year expected to grow to {XEU}500m in the next few years Bayer is understood to have offered to divest the US and European crop protection rights to Fipronil which account for about half of the insecticide's sales The company will retain an option to license back the rights for Fipronil's crop protection uses outside Europe and the US and for non-agrochemicals uses www ft com/bayer,1
2002-06-13, It is a depressing but increasingly realistic possibility that Germany is about to reverse one of the biggest steps it has made to modernise itself in the past decade At the start of this year the government abolished capital gains tax on corporate asset sales Now it looks as though the CGT may be reinstated With more than 50 per cent of German equity tied up in cross-shareholdings according to Deutsche Bank research the removal of CGT on the sale of such stakes is central to raising returns and creating open capital markets in Europe's largest economy In 2000 return on equity for Germany's 100 biggest companies was 15 per cent compared with more than 20 per cent for the S&P 500 In 1999 it was 12 per cent against 25 per cent according to Commerzbank research These low returns are the result of inefficient capital allocation which is itself the result of the difficulty of shifting capital around because of CGT Abolishing CGT therefore gets to the root of this problem and gives German companies an opportunity for fundamental restructuring redeploying freed-up capital to core businesses It should increase mergers and acquisitions and help weed out underperforming managements Without the protection of large passive investors companies will be forced to become more responsive to institutional shareholders Yet barely six months after its introduction the CGT reform is under threat Edmund Stoiber the conservative opposition candidate whose party is well ahead in the polls in the run-up to September's election has repeatedly announced his intention of re-examining this change in the law His argument is that it favours big business over companies from the Mittelstand These medium-sized companies which comprise Germany's business backbone tend not to own such stakes In response the social democratic government whose introduction of the reform marks one of its few genuine achievements is reconsidering its position though it has not said so openly yet This is partly because the expected boom in sales of cross-shareholdings which Chancellor Gerhard Schroder hoped would free resources to create new jobs and investment has failed to materialise And it is partly because Hans Eichel the finance minister is looking for every drop of revenue to achieve the balanced budget he has promised Brussels by 2004 With a desperate need to win back votes on the left there is growing pressure from the grassroots for the government to make a U-turn on this measure The business community not surprisingly is worried Josef Ackermann newly anointed chairman of Deutsche Bank has been telling investors on his introductory roadshows that he is nervous that CGT on asset sales will be reintroduced shortly after the election giving him little time to complete the disposal of the bank's huge portfolio of industrial assets Investment bankers in Frankfurt are even speculating that the reversal could be retrospective with companies that have taken advantage of the new law suddenly facing an unexpected tax bill It is true that the CGT holiday has been little used so far But that is largely a function of the depressed stock market Roland Flach the boss of WCM one of Germany's few corporate raiders admitted at his annual meeting last week that few companies were prepared to put their stakes up for sale at current prices Nor are there many buyers with the requisite confidence at present Yet underneath the surface the abolition of CGT has led to more activity than is generally recognised Allianz for example has disposed of industrial holdings worth about {XEU}18bn £11 5bn through bonds exchangeable into the shares of RWE Deutsche Bank and Siemens and by financing its takeover of Dresdner Bank largely through an exchange of stakes Deutsche Bank has sold {XEU}6 9bn worth of Allianz and Munich Re stock between October 1999 and March of this year and continued to reduce its holdings in the second quarter But a poor market background is only one factor Companies also face a problem in what to do with the money In theory reinvesting it in the core business is the right thing to do But many companies see few opportunities to do so profitably The obvious alternative handing the cash back to shareholders through special dividends or share repurchases is also not easy in Germany In spite of another recent change in the law special dividends still incur a significant tax penalty While the company does not have to pay CGT on the sale proceeds of non-core assets the shareholders will still have to although less than they would before 2002 For shareholders therefore special dividends destroy value and there is unlikely to be much call for them The situation with share buy-backs is not much better Until very recently repurchases were virtually impossible Under new rules they are feasible but industrial companies are still restricted But it would be wrong to conclude that the CGT reform has been a failure Rather than reintroducing CGT which would at best create a short-term boom in stake sales as companies seek to beat the deadline the politicians should work to relax the restrictions on special dividends and share repurchases Corporate Germany's modernisation has a long way to go and needs encouragement This column appears every two weeks The writer is financial

2002-04-27, There are three American flags flying outside the Cadillac dealership in Rochester south-east Michigan At the neighbouring Mercedes outlet the Stars and Stripes does not feature at all But there are nine flags outside the Lincoln-Mercury showroom down the street and one big one the size of a tennis court at the next Cadillac retailer In the US Lincoln and Cadillac have become the country's standard-bearers in the premium car market Both claim to stand for American luxury in an industry in which pick-up trucks minivans and sports utility vehicles have out-sold ordinary cars for several years General Motors and Ford the parents respectively of Cadillac and Lincoln are now trying to recapture part of the premium segment and some of their 1960s cachet after concentrating on lower-priced high-volume light trucks in their core brands It is an uphill struggle Cadillac and Lincoln may have dominated the US luxury car market 35 years ago but they surrendered their lead to the Europeans and the Japanese in the 1990s Today the premium market is dominated by Toyota's Lexus brand BMW and Mercedes Other marques such as Audi Jaguar Saab and Infiniti Nissan's premium offering have fragmented the market still further Although some of those European brands notably Land Rover Jaguar and Saab are owned by Ford or GM respectively Cadillac and Lincoln dealers do not regard them as stablemates They see them as the enemy One Cadillac sales agent in suburban Detroit boasts that she has captured customers from BMW and even Porsche We cannot get enough of the latest models there's nothing like them on the road she says having sold 20 of Cadillac's latest CTS models since its February launch Cadillac is pinning its future on the CTS in the car segment while appealing to pick-up drivers with its Escalade EXT a $50000 £35000 truck The EXT according to Cadillac is for the urbane extremist straining inside your ego It is a three-tonne truck with a pick-up rear end It has all the design appeal of the Berlin Wall and the handling ability of a sofa By comparison the CTS is positively streamlined But to European eyes it remains slab-sided with a grille described by Cadillac as an unapologetic out-of-my-way opening statement Not to be outdone Ford is launching a range of new Lincolns including an all-new Town Car and two new sports utility vehicles SUVs the Navigator and the Aviator The move co-incides with last week's management shake-up and brand reorganisation at Lincoln-Mercury prompted by the departure of Wolfgang Reitzle the vice-president and product guru for Ford's premium strategy Lincoln is ending production of its Continental model and Blackwood pick-up truck Still Lincoln dealers claim the brand demands that your highest expectations be fully achieved Unfortunately for Ford Lincoln has failed to meet its expectations The brand lost $800m-$1bn last year a huge swing from its near-$1bn profit in 2000 as a price war costly recalls and volatile demand dented sales Lincoln's weak performance and sluggish demand for Mercury its non- premium sister company clearly frustrated Mr Reitzle who is surrendering responsibility for Ford's premium brands to become chief executive of Linde the German engineering group Mr Reitzle a former BMW production chief believed there was a place for American luxury But he warned it would need heavy investment and a controversial overhaul of the US dealer network Ford faced with losses of $5 45bn last year and a sweeping restructuring refused to write a blank cheque for Lincoln Nick Scheele Ford chief operating officer says Lincoln will be folded back into the blue oval's core North American business where it will have to make do with re-engineered Ford platforms Compared with Lincoln sales and production at Cadillac moved in the right direction at least Strong demand for the CTS helped lift sales by 18 4 per cent in March while output is up almost 20 per cent so far this year Rick Wagoner GM chief executive says We have a steady drumbeat of new Cadillac models coming along after many years of having trouble getting any traction  That effort has involved building a new plant in Lansing Michigan adopting European engineering techniques and a new edgy appearance overseen by Simon Cox a British designer At the same time Gerry McGovern another British-born designer has been entrusted with overhauling Lincoln's image The real challenge is whether Cadillac or Lincoln can woo US motorists accustomed to the design and build-quality of Lexus or BMW More importantly the brands have to prove they can achieve the demanding 8-9 per cent profit margins enjoyed by Japanese and German rivals There is an admission at least within GM that Cadillac cannot beat BMW at its own game There are a lot of premium makes trying to be the same thing We're bringing something new with Escalade and CTS says one GM director Similarly Lincoln hopes to re-define itself by moving more towards SUVs and so-called crossover vehicles and away from low-margin daily rentals and fleet cars For both brands that effort will be concentrated in the US Cadillac has postponed plans to export its new CTS model to Europe Mr Scheele says the prospects for exporting Lincoln are zero When it comes to American luxury the German-Japanese assault will be fought and decided on US soil For now an unfavourable currency a battered brand heritage and mixed quality have put Cadillac and Lincoln on the defensive ,1
2002-06-06, More than 30 combined-cycle plant proposals have been announced in Spain since liberalisation of the energy sector began in 1997 writes Joshua Levitt The plants are more efficient and ecologically friendly than traditional energy sources But to date only two have come on-line joint ventures between Endesa Spain's biggest utility and Gas Natural AES the US energy group which is buying its gas from a foreign trader and Bizkaia Energia owned by ESBI of Ireland and likely to be fuelled by Shell are the only foreign entrants with advanced plans to build combined-cycle plants They don't expect to bring their combined-cycle plants online until 2004 or 2005 Enagas the network operator says capacity requests are filled on a first-come first-served basis But some companies say capacity simply isn't being shared because Enagas is controlled by Gas Natural RWE a German utility was denied access after refusing to accept rules for the auction of part of an Algerian contract held by Gas Natural RWE says the rules were discriminatory and unfair and is taking the issue to the European Commission It has also filed a lawsuit against the Spanish finance ministry A complaint was filed with the energy regulator which last month ruled in RWE's favour but RWE still needs to negotiate the location of the gas delivery We got the impression that the national regulatory authorities are as a rule on the side of the incumbents says RWE's Schaeser Rals It's always the same story incumbents would like to keep the business to themselves ,3
2002-06-24, What is the most appropriate asset for a pension fund to hold The easy answer is one that most closely matches its liabilities But that answer of course only begs the question The rough-and-ready answer used to be equities on the grounds that they were a real asset that matched the pension funds' real liabilities rising wages Research however indicates that equities do not correlate that well with either inflation or a fund's liabilities Index-linked bonds might seem an ideal match save for the problem that there are nowhere near enough of them to satisfy the needs of the pensions industry The issue is also complicated by the differing requirements of regulators and accounting standards boards The UK's Minimum Funding Requirement for example requires funds to discount liabilities using the long-dated gilt yield the accounting standard FRS 17 uses the yield on AA corporate bonds It is natural in the circumstances for fund managers to increase their exposures to gilts and corporate bonds in order to avoid a funding mismatch Perhaps the more fundamental issue however is the kind of risk that companies take on when they establish a defined benefit pension fund and then invest heavily in equities Essentially companies are writing a put option on the equity market if the market falls sharply they will be required to stump up cash When the pension fund gets very large relative to the size of the company as can easily happen if the group has been through several rounds of restructurings then this risk can seem daunting One wag has described British Airways as a large hedge fund with a struggling airline attached This is probably the right light in which to see the much-publicised decision of Boots the health and beauty retailer to switch 100 per cent of its pension fund assets into bonds That move was not motivated by a view on the prospects for equity markets nor was it based on the maturity of the fund about 50 per cent of the members are still active But it makes sense when viewed as a decision based on risk The pensions of Boots' members are now pretty secure matched as they are by long-dated AAA bonds Boots now also has a level of certainty about its future contributions In addition it has protection against inflation about a third of the fund is index-linked This security does not come without a cost Over the long term equities deliver a higher return than bonds or cash so investing wholly in bonds will increase the cost to the company of providing a pension In effect a company that switches to a bond portfolio is trading higher payments for lower volatility Given the pain that volatility can inflict on profits balance sheets and share prices that is a trade that many finance directors might be willing to make Arguably if companies are going to take on extra risk it should be elsewhere within their balance sheets Boots for example has launched a £300m $438m share buy-back this gearing up of the company is much easier for the investor to assess than the exposure of the pension fund But what if everyone in the pension fund industry wanted to follow Boots's lead Andrew Roberts director of global securities at Merrill Lynch says that at least £75bn of UK pension fund money may shift from equities to bonds That would have significant effects on UK asset markets Someone has to buy the equities that pension funds are selling and insurers may not be willing purchasers given their need to meet solvency requirements Overseas funds and private investors might take up the slack but at what price Furthermore if pension funds are to buy £75bn worth of bonds someone has to issue them The UK government may be moving into deficit but its finances are not that bad So the corporate sector will have to issue the bonds But if the corporate sector takes on more debt its equities will become more risky That suggests investors would be buyers only at lower valuations Thus UK equities could be hit by a double whammy as a result of the asset shift Some of these issues may explain why equity markets have been so sluggish over the past few years the portion of a pension fund devoted to UK equities has dropped from 55 per cent in 1995 to 46 per cent last year But there could be a lot further to go Merrill Lynch estimates that in the long run the UK equity allocation could fall to 30 per cent ,2
2002-06-10, Modern fund management was invented in Scotland Or so many Scots argue They cite buccaneering risk-takers such as Carlysle Gifford and James Ivory financial innovators who scoured the world for clever ways of investing their industrialist clients' profits at the tail end of the industrial revolution They became known as the cut-glass cowboys of Charlotte Square and theirs was an expansive era of Scottish confidence Nowhere was this more manifest than in the classical Georgian townhouses from which they did business the gold-stoned buildings of Charlotte Square in the heart of Edinburgh's New Town These now-darkened edifices were an expression of the Scottish Enlightenment a moment some US historians claim when the modern western democratic world was invented Nothing quite so historically defining is currently afoot in Edinburgh's New Town or indeed in its newer less gracious financial districts But a revival of confidence is palpable After two decades of decline the names of Ivory and Gifford survive in the companies they founded Friends Ivory & Sime and Baillie Gifford but Scottish fund management has lost its global pre-eminence Critics of the industry's relative under-performance in recent decades say that 20 years ago Ivory & Sime was the same size as Mercury Asset Management which grew to become the UK's largest pension fund manager But in the 1980s with their heavy emphasis on investment trusts another Scottish invention firms north of the border missed out on the boom in pensions and other savings products Funds and talented investment managers headed south The famous names survived but faded Scottish fund management with some exceptions became a byword for the cosy and parochial When global industry consolidation intensified in the 1990s many feared for the survival of Edinburgh as a fund management centre of significance But unexpectedly consolidation helped foment a revival Yes a slew of famous names lost their independence Aegon the Dutch insurer swallowed up Scottish Equitable while Lloyds-TSB took over Scottish Widows But these new owners based their business in Edinburgh investing in the city's reserve of fund management expertise Meanwhile independent houses such as Aberdeen Asset Management and Baillie Gifford prospered though a few also fell by the wayside Overall as the new century arrived funds under management from Scotland peaked at a record £350bn a remarkable reverse of the outflows of the early 1990s Not everyone is convinced by this success story Sceptics say the spectacular rise in funds under management from Scotland brought by a handful of corporate decisions could just as easily be reversed They say Edinburgh's revival relies heavily on a wee group of companies What if Scottish Widows Investment Partners or Standard Life Investments were to falter Moreover some ask how can Edinburgh hope to compete for talent with centres such as London and New York Salaries bonuses and opportunities in the Scottish capital cannot match those in either metropolis But surprisingly Edinburgh and the Scottish-based investment houses do seem to be competing In the past 18 months Edinburgh-based investment companies have recruited an unprecedented number of senior investment managers perhaps as many as 50 Moreover these are not simply professionals deciding to jump ship from the pressures of the City to play more golf or spend time with their children Edinburgh's easier work-life balance is undeniably a factor But many newcomers have professional reasons for the move Some cite the appeal of working for smaller more purist fund management institutions Others say they don't miss the selling environment of the City and what one senior executive calls the broker-fuelled rumours that swirl about the Square Mile Overall the Scottish fund management industry has in the past year or so enjoyed not just its biggest rise in funds under management but perhaps its biggest influx of fresh fund management talent in a generation They may be home-loving stock-pickers rather than cut-glass gunslingers But their presence offers a reason to believe that an industry more or less invented in late 19th-century Edinburgh has a reasonable chance of flourishing there some way into the 21st ,2
2002-04-12, Crude oil futures fell yesterday as speculators starting to doubt the threat of a supply shortage took profits As Venezuela's national labour strike entered its third day news that oil operations continued despite loading delays eased jitters about supply interruptions And Opec secretary-general Ali Rodriguez was quoted as saying that the cartel might consider raising output if it saw a significant change in demand Late in London May Brent was 76 cents down at $25 25 after a low of $25 15 a barrel By early afternoon in New York May WTI was down 96 cents a barrel at $25 17 after a low of $25 08 Opec's compliance with its own output quotas deteriorated in March according to Platts The 10 countries excluding Iraq which exports under the United Nations oil-for-food programme increased output by 250000 barrels a day to 22 94m b/d This exceeded their ceiling by 1 24m b/d In January they had resolved to cut about 1 5m b/d in a bid to support prices Saudi Arabia had the worst compliance record increasing production by 130000 b/d to an average 7 37m b/d compared with a quota of 7 05m b/d But this month may be different said John Kingston Platts' global director of oil It may be that Opec will report significantly greater compliance in April solely on the back of a presumed decline in Venezuela because of that country's ongoing labour strife he said ,2

2002-06-17, Fund managers are turning away from the poorly performing US equity market in pursuit of gains in emerging markets such as Asia and South America The latest Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers issued tomorrow will show that some managers have stopped adding to their US positions in recent weeks The issue of poor valuation in the US has been apparent for some time and a trend of international investing is beginning to take momentum said David Bowers chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch The survey of 300 fund managers worldwide is expected to show that managers were bearish on the US the world's most overvalued market and bullish on emerging markets Global stock funds invest part of their money in the US and part in non-US markets Mr Bowers pointed out that emerging markets were small and illiquid You can't sell US and buy Thailand It is going to be a mix of both  Among the top global funds at the end of May were American Funds New Prospective with assets of $28 5bn and Janus Worldwide with $18 6bn in assets Tyco's disastrous performance after the resignation and indictment on tax charges of its chief executive Denis Kozlowski and the Enron bankruptcy hurt confidence in US equities Barton Biggs the respected strategist at Morgan Stanley says US equity markets are oversold and will make a sustainable rally of more than 20 per cent in big indices In the grinding low-return environment we seem to be stuck in professional investors can't afford to miss major counter-trend rallies nor can we sit on the sidelines sucking our thumbs paralysed by fears of a terrorist or nuclear apocalypse he said The level of allocation to international markets would be the make or break decision for big portfolios in the next half decade he said Global equity portfolios should be 10 percentage points underweight in the US equal weight in Europe four percentage points overweight Japan and three overweight Asia not including Japan he added ,2
2002-06-10, The US administration is unlikely to order any big structural changes to the way the country's energy markets operate despite the impact of the Californian energy trading scandal Spencer Abraham US energy secretary has told the Financial Times that the administration believes the energy market is fundamentally very sound He also defended George W Bush's stance on climate change and said the president's apparent U-turn on the causes of global warming had been misinterpreted Californian officials and Senate committee members have criticised the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for being slow to prevent market manipulation by energy traders and have called for re-regulation of off-exchange trading Some consumer groups have claimed that Ferc was not sufficiently independent from the government or the energy industry while the White House is being investigated by Congress for its links to Enron the failed US energy trader Mr Abraham brushed aside the criticisms and said there was no need to alter the structure of Ferc or the commitment of the US to liberalised energy markets Free markets work in our economy in virtually every other sector and they can work in the energy sector if you have a process of strong oversight and investigation which Ferc has proven it can do and is proving right now he said A number of energy traders operating in the Californian power market including Enron CMS Energy Reliant Resources and Dynegy have admitted to bogus round-trip trades that inflated their trading volumes Mr Abraham said Ferc had been very aggressive in dealing with the problem and had proscribed behaviour that could lead to market manipulation While no structural changes were necessary the administration was pressing for substantial increases in the penalties Ferc could apply Some of California's power problems have been attributed to the way liberalisation was introduced by state utility regulators Power supply companies were forced to buy electricity on the volatile spot market but were prevented from raising their prices to customers Despite this Mr Abraham said there would be no move to increase federal power over deregulation of the energy markets Mr Abraham defended the White House from criticism that it had been slow to release documents on its ties with Enron and that those it had released had been censored He said the administration had nothing to hide but was standing by a point of principle He also claimed the president's past comments on climate change had been widely misunderstood The US media last week accused Mr Bush of performing a U-turn on climate change by admitting for the first time that global warming was caused by human activity Mr Abraham said the US was committed to a leading role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions despite eschewing the Kyoto protocol on climate change Evidence of this was the administration's decision to replace a Clinton-era programme to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks with a research programme into hydrogen fuel cell vehicles which produce no emissions For regional reports www ft com/usa www ft com/americas,3

2002-06-25, Brazil's financial markets yesterday recovered marginally from pre-election nervousness as opinion polls and central bank intervention triggered frantic trading The Real in early trading sank toalow of R$2 86 against the dollar before recovering to R$2 80 by early afternoon The equity and foreign debt markets mirrored the currency's performance rising slightly later in the day Brazil's central bank yesterday increased legal reserve requirements on savings deposits from 15 per cent to 20 per cent in the hope of draining some $R6bn US$2 1bn from financial markets Arminio Fraga central bank president told the Financial Times that the bank would continue to use standard policy instruments at its disposal We have no rabbits to pull out of the hat but our policy is appropriately tight he said While acknowledging the difficulty of forecasting market behaviour in coming days he suggested signs of a turnaround could follow last week's market climax Mr Fraga who will seek to calm foreign investors in London and Paris later this week rejected as absurd recent proposals to renegotiate Brazil's domestic debt The plain talk of that is not only silly but dangerous he said We are entirely able to manage our debt  The central bank has encountered growing difficulties in rolling over its domestic debt because of investors' reluctance to buy treasury bonds expiring after the election Between July and December this year some R$116bn of a total R$552 4bn domestic debt will mature according to Deutsche Bank Yet unlike Argentina's public debt most of Brazil's is held domestically and in local currency Investors yesterday were encouraged by results of a voter opinion poll showing Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the presidential candidate of the leftwing Workers party PT falling 4 percentage points from last month to 36 1 per cent Jose Serra the government candidate and leading proponent of economic continuity rose 7 6 percentage points to 21 per cent according to the Sensus poll Uncertainty over the PT's economic programme and its commitment to service a growing public debt burden have been at the heart of a two-month sell-off in the Brazilian bond and currency markets Mr da Silva at the weekend said he would adhere to strict fiscal discipline and government contractual obligations if he came to power Most investors welcomed the statements but said the party would have to set its commitments in stone The PT has shifted to adopt these principles very recently and they need to show they are for real said Edmar Bacha chief economist for Banco BBA a local bank Mr Bacha suggested the party ought to commit to a 3 5 per cent primary budget surplus to service government debt for 2006 as part of guidelines to be approved in Congress A top PT economic adviser said at the weekend the party would approve next year's surplus of 3 75 per cent of gross domestic product Editorial Comment Page 18,2
2002-06-10, It is time to write in praise of box-ticking the term of abuse used by so many business people in the great bull market of the 1990s to denigrate corporate governance What's the point and where's the evidence was the nub of the big business critique Well the academic evidence has been accumulating steadily But the more compelling argument derives from the growing fallout after the boom First came Enron where the independence of the non-executive directors was impaired because of large consultancy fees and payment in stock options And now we have Tyco International the acquisitive conglomerate whose chief executive Dennis Kozlowski has been forced to resign after an indictment for tax evasion leaving a collapsing stock price in his wake As Richard Lambert highlighted in the Financial Times last week there was scarcely a rule of corporate governance that Tyco did not break and its accounting practices have long been controversial Anyone who looked at the ticks in the boxes could have spared themselves the pain of a great deal of value destruction The warning signals were deafening True companies that comply with all the basic governance rules can still get into trouble In the end the quality or lack of quality of the people on corporate boards counts for more than compliance with rules Yet if corporate governance is effectively monitored by institutional shareholders it has the enormous benefit of reducing the accident rate in a downturn This cannot be quantified because you cannot prove a negative But it is no less real for that A glance at Tyco suggests that the real problem with corporate governance is not box-ticking but that too many shareholders have taken their eye off the box ,2
2002-04-17, A visitor to Britain might conclude from lurid accounts of Labour sleaze that the government is drowning in a sea of corruption Far from it New Labour has had its embarrassments over financing but much of the noise about cash for influence has been little more than political mud-slinging Those who sling the mud should reflect on the consequences for party funding The paradox is that the government is being pilloried by the transparency it introduced into party finances A good example is the weekend story that Tony Blair used a trip to the Czech Republic to promote the sale of jet fighters produced by a UK-Swedish consortium BAE Systems a consortium member had donated more than £5000 to Labour in 1998-99 and 2000-01 and also paid £12m to sponsor the Millennium Dome mind zone How do we know about the donations Because they were declared under the rules introduced by New Labour Is it unusual for the prime minister to use a foreign visit to support a business deal that would benefit the UK No he does it all the time as do leaders of other countries It would be better if the practice was ended but Margaret Thatcher batted for Britain with no less gusto Labour is not entirely blameless particularly given its campaign against Tory sleaze Its latest embarrassment is the dual role of Lord Levy Mr Blair's personal envoy to the Middle East who retains extensive interests while acting as Labour's chief fundraiser He denies any conflict of interest but it is difficult to reconcile his various roles in the public eye However the attacks go much wider If the government does anything that benefits a Labour donor it is now taken as an example of corruption even if the two events are several years apart For potential donors it is increasingly obvious that handing over money to a political party is likely to lead to embarrassment As an FT survey recently found the result is that donations from large companies have all but dried up They have been replaced by less transparent forms of support such as sponsorship of think-tanks that do not have to be declared publicly If this continues political parties will sooner or later be forced to rely on state funding As the experience of other countries shows this is often ineffective at preventing sleaze It can also add to the unpopularity of politicians who are seen as living high on the hog at public expense So far as possible political parties should be funded by voluntary donations Companies associations and wealthy individuals that support them should not be pilloried Indeed with full disclosure of donations they should be congratulated for sustaining the clash of political views at the heart of a healthy democracy ,3
2002-06-20, Donald Evans the US commerce secretary has much in common with his president Both are career Texas oilmen Evans began roughnecking in an oil rig in Midland Texas 25 years ago at much the same time that George W was trying his luck in the same place And the two men seem to share political views with Evans serving on Bush's gubernatorial campaigns and chairing the Bush/Cheney presidential campaign Unfortunately the two also seem to share a certain infelicity with words be they English or Spanish In Mexico leading a trade delegation this week Evans cheerfully preached the gospel of free enterprise in spite of repeated questions about steel tariffs and farm subsidies The Mexican audience was also startled to hear that Evans would be heading to Cabo for the Apec meeting later this year everyone else is going to Los Cabos and that the US was underwriting a feasibility study into extending Pueblo airport Er it is Puebla airport that needs the attention ,3
2002-04-12, With or without theinjured David Beckham this summer's World Cup in Japan and Korea is not proving to be as valuable as ITV hoped Fear about the England captain eased slightly yesterday when it emerged that the broken bone in his foot could heal within six weeks allowing him to make it to the Far East But the outlook for ITV looks less hopeful It has been forced to lower the cost of sponsorship for its football World Cup slots after failing to attract sufficient interest from advertisers ITV had hoped to attract bids of about £3 5m for sponsorship which would have accompanied all of its programming during the four-week competition However the commercial network has been forced to lower the cost of the package from £3 5m to £2 5m ITV said it was looking for bids of £3m but was in negotiations that could lead to lower prices being offered Potential buyers said they had been quoted £2 5m Most English fans will be at work and will miss most World Cup matches because of the time difference with Korea and Japan Compared to past World Cups a small audience is expected This and the suspicion that England will struggle to get past the first round has deterred potential advertisers ITV had been banking on the World Cup to revitalise what has been a dismal year for advertising The network must share broadcast of some of the most high-profile England matches with the BBC which has also put companies off investing in the sponsorship The BBC normally gets at least 60 per cent of the available audience said a person close to one of the companies approached by ITV The only game ITV has to itself is England-Sweden When you consider that England might get dumped out of the competition after the group stage the ITV package does not look very attractive I'm sure ITV will be able to find a sponsor but it will get only what the market is willing to pay  ITV is obliged to offer sponsorship of its tournament coverage to the 15 companies that are paying millions of dollars to Fifa football's governing body to sponsor the event None of these companies has yet to show any interest But ITV said this was completely normal as World Cup sponsors had not sponsored ITV's past coverage of the tournament These things are normally sorted out at the last minute We're very confident we won't have any trouble  The advertising slots known as break bumpers will be broadcast before games at half-time and after the final whistle ITV will pin its hopes on an improved advertising performance at the 2006 World Cup in Germany when there will be no significant time difference Sport Page 16 Observer Page 21 League seeks probe Page 24 www ft com/sport,1
2002-04-26, Marconi the telecommunications equipment group is to take a further £700m-£800m write-down of goodwill and inventory taking its expected total write-down for 2001 to more than £5 2bn one of the biggest charges in UK corporate history The decision means that Marconi has now effectively decided to write down almost all of the value of its two large US acquisitions Fore Systems and Reltec The need for another write-down comes amid a continued deterioration in the telecoms market underlined in recent weeks by problems at Ericsson Lucent and Nortel In its fourth quarter trading update Marconi highlighted an absence of major orders for new network build and a lower level of purchase commitments under existing frame contracts Steve Hare finance director said about half of the new write-down related to Reltec the US access business The comments accompanied a trading update for the fourth quarter Marconi said the seasonal lift in sales in its core communications business for the three months to March 31 had been lower than usual at £813m compared with £1 4bn a year ago In the third quarter sales were £706m Operating losses in the core business shrank to £108m down from £130m in the previous quarter Mike Parton chief executive said Marconi had generated £204m of operating cash during the quarter We are not selling our businesses for cash and then blowing it on running the business  Mr Parton denied there had been pressure from its creditors for resignations There had never been any discussions with the banks about the resignation of any of the executive team  Even so he said talks had been held with bond holders and banks about bringing in an outside manager to work with the existing team Marconi said it had met its target of reducing net debt to £2 7bn- £3 2bn reporting net debt of £2 9bn It has cash of £1 4bn raised from disposals The company has set aside £850m of this cash for the restructuring process We will not use it for our normal business The money is there as a carrot for the banks and bond holders said Mr Parton Marconi has put together a 102-page five-year business plan with the help of LEK the management consultancy The plan which includes projected revenues costs cash flow is currently being reviewed by Marconi's creditors Hopes of an early recovery look bleak Marconi's order book has fallen by £200m from £1 9bn at September 30 to £1 7bn now and its bread and butter network services revenues saw a marked decrease in the recent quarter Responses to the business plan from the banks and bond holders are expected in the next two weeks with an update on the talks set for May 16 Mr Parton concluded I am confident we will get an agreement It is the only sane rational thing to do in the circumstances  Lombard Page 23 www ft com/lex,1
2002-06-14, You have to hand it to Allan Leighton in January before he became chairman of Consignia the organisation's future looked as bright as the bottom of a postman's sack Four months on and he has given it a distinct glimmer of hope although the restructuring plan he unveiled yesterday is inevitably high risk He took over a business haemorrhaging cash its management discredited its workers bellicose and the new postal regulator about to throw open the doors to competition None of those problems has gone away but Mr Leighton has won breathing space to put in place a restructuring that just might work he has convinced the government to hand back £1 8bn of accumulated profits which will go a long way to help with a redundancy programme the regulator has deferred by a year its plan to introduce phased competition and at least for now the traditionally strike-prone Communications Workers Union is not making especially aggressive noises about the loss of 30000 jobs So far Mr Leighton has been the right man in the right place at the right time already a non-executive director of Consignia with knowledge of the organisation a businessman with a strong track record in the private sector as chief executive of Asda and thus clout with ministers and a man who was famed at Asda for his egalitarian touch Several of his actions yesterday should have helped this better mood music at least among the rank and file if not the demoralised ranks of management the scrapping of the wretched Consignia name the placing of a lot of the blame for the Post Office's problems on its past management and an emphasis on the need for a motivated workforce and the retirement of John Roberts the chief executive But implementation of the ambitious plan sensible in itself could still go horribly wrong The union unhappy at the details might yet strike The timetable could slip and competition be unleashed before the company is ready for it And the government will be in no mood to dole out more cash Nor will Mr Leighton necessarily be driving through the changes Much will fall to the new chief executive yet to be appointed He or she needs to be a first class act of the kind that has not graced Consignia's executive ranks till now If it works the logical final act should be privatisation at least of the Royal Mail side of the business But that is hardly a line Mr Leighton will be breathing in the delicate talks with unions that lie ahead ,1
2002-06-04, Has the Third Way hit a dead end Observer hears Tony Blair is struggling to muster European centre-left leaders for a much-vaunted Third Way revival conference featuring Bill and Hillary Clinton The organisers led by Evelyn de Rothschild and his New York-based wife Lynn Forester had assumed the ex-president would prove an irresistible draw And the British are fielding several cabinet heavyweights besides Blair including Gordon Brown and John Reid Peter Mandelson has also played a prominent role in arranging the event which takes place in Hertfordshire this month But the response from centre-left leaders in the rest of Europe has been less than enthusiastic Sweden's Goran Persson is apparently unavailable as are a clutch of other progressive leaders Gerhard Schroder may be too busy chasing votes to attend although the organisers are still hoping he may make a brief appearance If he can find the way ,3
2002-06-10, Are country funds and single-country funds in particular headed for extinction A growing number of investment advisers and fund managers think so At the end of April the France Growth Fund became the 14th single-country closed-end fund to propose a change to its status since 1998 according to Lipper the fund tracker The New York-based fund which has net assets of $103 5m £70 8m and is managed by Eric Bleines the senior European equity portfolio manager with Credit Agricole Asset Management US has asked its shareholders to approve its transformation from an exclusively French investment vehicle into a pan-European fund designed to capitalise on investment opportunities arising from the dynamic economic developments in the European Union Shareholders are due to vote on the proposal later this month The concept of doing business in France is irrelevant in a way said Pierre Daviron one of the fund directors That is like trying to invest in US companies but only buying companies which trade on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange  However the problems of the France Growth Fund reflected in its disappointing performance over the past two years are much the same as those facing other single-country funds European integration means there are often too few companies to invest in or to provide adequate diversification for single-country funds Among the other closed-end funds to merge or shut down in the past year are the small Austrian Fund managed by Mark Breedon and the $140m Scudder Argentina fund which merged with Scudder's open-end Latin America fund Scudder cited a Securities and Exchange Commission rule change enacted in March last year that required funds that focus on a particular type of investment including country funds to hold at least 80 per cent of their assets in that type of investment But even ahead of the SEC rule change many of the 60-plus closed-end country funds were struggling with some trading at a significant discount to net asset value Most country funds produced a patchy performance at best during the 1990s and many continued to lag their domestic US counterparts through the recession prompting some investors to question their value for diversification purposes Indeed the average annual gain of 716 international equity funds tracked by Bloomberg was just 1 3 per cent over the past five years compared with 7 1 per cent for more than 7400 domestic stock funds Similarly a Morningstar measure of international stock funds gained 6 6 per cent over the past 10 years compared with the 11 5 per cent recorded by US diversified funds Such comparisons have helped bolster the case against country funds Critics argue that the growth of globalisation and the closer interlocking of regional economies means that the value of country and to a lesser extent regional funds as a counterweight to US exposure has been reduced If the leading economies are increasingly in lock step why add the currency and other risks associated with overseas investments Certainly the strength of the dollar over the past decade has been one factor reducing the attractiveness of country funds to US investors although with the US currency showing signs of weakening that barrier could be lessened Nevertheless many fund managers even those with their own country funds fear that the days of country-specific if not regional funds may be numbered Eric Ritter portfolio manager for the Driehaus Asia Pacific Growth Fund believes many more could disappear over in the next few years There is no demand for country or regional funds he says ,2

2002-06-11, Longer-dated US Treasuries remained in favour with investors yesterday as equities continued to languish despite signs of an economic recovery The May jobs report released on Friday showed a fall in the unemployment report to 5 8 per cent However Treasuries took only slight losses Economists say lack of confidence in corporate earnings amid numerous accounting scandals has made investors wary of shares and the failure of the equity market to rally on the better economic data is keeping investors in bonds Fear of terrorist attacks was also renewed after the Justice Department said it had captured an Al Qaeda operative who had planned to attack the US with a radioactive dirty bomb The 30-year US Treasury strengthened after the announcement rising {15/32} to 96{7/16} to yield 5 626 per cent The 10-year note was unchanged at 98{9/16} to yield 5 063 per cent while the two-year note was also unchanged at 100{3/16} with a yield of 3 143 per cent In the eurozone government bond prices rose in line with those of US Treasuries as investors sought a safe haven in debt securities following news of the foiled terrorist bomb attack on the US The 10-year German bund yield fell 3 1 basis points to 5 098 per cent The yield on the two-year German schatz fell 7 9 basis point to 4 131 per cent The price of the 10-year German bund future rose 0 17 to 106 07 Japanese government bond futures were lifted by short-covering on the penultimate day of trading in the June futures contract June JGB futures touched 139 46 the highest for the contract on buy-backs before ending the day at 139 41 up 0 10 from Friday's close The 10-year cash No 239 JGB slipped 0 044 to 100 308 amid thin trade and few incentives to push prices higher The yield rose 0 005 to 1 365 per cent The market is focused on the auction of Y700bn of 20-year JGBs on Thursday and on the Bank of Japan's two-day monetary policy meeting starting on Tuesday The central bank is expected to maintain interest rates at their current ultra low levels Traders and investors shrugged off economic data released yesterday showing a 17 9 per cent year-on-year fall in machinery orders and 1 2 per cent decline in wholesale prices The decline in machinery orders a fore-runner of capital expenditure supported the growing view that weak capital expenditure will be a drag on the economy this year even though gross domestic product expanded by 1 4 per cent between January and March from the previous quarter After the market closed Moody's Investors Service said it would be wrong to assume that Japanese banks' credit ratings would always be linked to those of JGBs and that it was possible for certain banks to have higher ratings than JGBs Moody's last month downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating to A2 from Aa3 citing the high levels of public debt Japanese financial institutions have been plagued by non-performing loans deepening concern about the health of these banks some of which rank among the world's largest by assets But many believe the government would not allow a large bank to collapse The key message is that the JGB rating does not fully capture the government's ability and willingness to extend support to banking institutions Moody's said It said bank ratings would be assessed on a case by case basis to gauge the appropriate nature of their rating relationship with JGBs taking into account various factors including franchise financial fundamentals the systemic importance of each institution and the evolving Japanese banking supervisory and resolution framework It is therefore possible for the ratings of certain banks to be above that of JGBs it said Moody's has previously said preserving banking sector stability was a top priority for the government which still had the capacity to support the banks ,2
2002-06-14, At the larger end of the bond market GECC and KfW yesterday priced their latest sizeable euro debt issues while there were also interesting smaller deals from National Grid and the Big Food group of the UK GECC the financing arm of General Electric priced {XEU}3bn of debt at spreads that were slightly tighter than original guidelines A {XEU}2bn five-year tranche was priced to yield 37 basis points over mid-swaps or 5 237 per cent while {XEU}1bn of two-year floating-rate notes were priced to yield 18 basis points over Euribor Bankers said that 90 per cent of the bonds were sold to European investors with buyers in the UK Germany and the Netherlands taking the lead German development bank KfW meanwhile priced {XEU}5bn of five-year bonds to yield 20 basis points over government bonds This is the latest issue from KfW's euro benchmark debt programme which aims to sell at least {XEU}15bn of liquid euro bonds each year Bankers said that 23 per cent of the bonds were sold to Asia with 7 per cent sold to US investors and the bulk going to European funds KfW debt is being perceived more and more as a Bund surrogate and investors are now realising the liquidity offered by KfW's benchmarks said Zias Awad on the syndicate at joint bookrunner Goldman Sachs In the sterling market UK electricity network operator National Grid broke new ground in the index-linked bond sector with a £400m four-tranche deal A £300m sale of 16-year retail inflation-linked bonds priced to yield 68 basis points over gilts made up the main part of the issue There was also three smaller tranches of debt one maturing in 2032 and two taps to existing National Grid inflation-linked debt The bonds were guaranteed by financial insurer Ambac in order to achieve a Triple A rating allowing a lower cost of borrowing and a bigger issue size for National Grid National Grid's issue takes advantage of the unsatisfied demand in the market for highly-rated index-linked debt especially among UK pension funds Index-linked debt is a relatively narrow market so National Grid's deal represents a considerable chunk of the sector said Robert St John on the syndicate at joint bookrunners Royal Bank of Scotland Investors will be hoping that other borrowers follow National Grid's example bankers said There is a rapidly expanding market for non-gilt index-linked debt ,2

2002-06-24, Germany could cut its jobless total by half to 2m in only three years if it adopted radical proposals to overhaul the way unemployed people are encouraged back to work according to the chairman of a government- appointed commission on labour market reforms Peter Hartz personnel chief at carmaker Volkswagen and chairman of a commission on the future of the troubled federal labour office said at the weekend that a combination of time limits on unemployment benefits streamlined job placement procedures and support for self-employment could sharply cut Germany's 4m unemployed In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine he said his commission's report to be published in mid-August would recommend that employment offices set up their own temporary employment agencies which could dispatch jobless people to vacant posts Many unemployed people will in practical terms become employees of the employment offices he said In another radical idea cleaners and others working in the underground economy would be given tax breaks to set up one-person companies Reforms to Germany's regimented labour market have been long seen by many economists as a necessary step in reviving the country's economic performance The commission was set up by chancellor Gerhard Schroder earlier this year after a controversy in the federal labour office over job placement figures The 15-person commission includes business leaders academics and trade union officials The chancellor said we should produce an ambitious concept Mr Hartz said in comments which were supported by other members of the commission A spokesman for Mr Schroder responded positively to Mr Hartz's comments saying they highlighted the need for important and far-reaching reforms of the labour market By yesterday the proposals had become an election issue amid signs of tension within Mr Schroder's social democratic and trade union constituency Lothar Spath the opposition Christian Democrats' economics and labour market expert welcomed the proposals adding I'll be interested to know whether the SPD will adopt them in its election campaign Although trade union leaders are Hartz commission members Michael Sommer head of the DGB trade union federation rejected the proposals as counter-productive and as supportive of the neo-liberal mood in the country Several of the SPD's labour market specialists also said the proposals in their current form would be rejected as too radical by the party's parliamentary group ,3
2002-06-19, The purchase by Electricite de France the state-owned power utility of the UK's Seeboard from American Electric Power for £1 39bn $2bn is the latest in a series of ambitious and sometimes controversial foreign acquisitions by EdF EdF has already spent two-thirds of the {XEU}19bn $18bn it earmarked for international expansion between 2001 and 2003 and claimed at the start of this year it was entering a period of consolidation rather than dramatic growth Yet it continues to spend money abroad Under chairman Francois Roussely EdF aims to generate half its sales outside its core French electricity market within three years compared with 35 per cent last year and 25 per cent in 2000 It already has 30 affiliated companies in Europe and 21 elsewhere mainly in Latin America and China This growth has come at a financial and political cost Last year EdF's net profit fell 26 per cent to {XEU}841m largely because of heavy foreign exchange losses in Argentina and Brazil and a loss from its investment in EnBW of Germany EdF's figures would have looked even worse had it not clawed back {XEU}1 1bn in provisions after renegotiating a French nuclear fuel reprocessing contract On the political front EdF has been target of intense criticism from countries such as the UK Spain and Italy for taking advantage of liberalised European energy markets while its own domestic fiefdom remains largely intact Its ability as an unquoted state company to raise money at favourable interest rates and escape market scrutiny of its actions further irritates its listed European rivals EdF executives argue their foreign investments are justified by the need to become a leading European and global energy group precisely because liberalisation across Europe means the company can no longer rely on a secure market in France Already rivals such as Suez have begun luring away big French industrial clients from EdF Developing countries make a tempting alternative to the mature industrialised markets An unrepentant senior executive said recently that electricity demand in Argentina and Brazil was growing by 4-6 per cent a year and in China by 8-12 per cent So it's very attractive but of course there are risks he said Europe however remains the principal focus for EdF Yesterday's Seeboard deal although on the expensive side will benefit EdF by bringing the number of its UK household customers above the 5m level it regards as essential for economies of scale EdF's strategy is based on vertical integration ownership of all stages of the business from power generation to selling the electricity and a notable feature of yesterday's agreement is the purchase of a stake in the Medway power station EdF says it is focusing on gas as well as electricity but not on other services such as water sewerage or telecommunications Like other utilities groups such as Suez and Vivendi Environnement EdF is eager to secure big industrial customers Because these companies are increasingly international EdF believes its presence in the main economies should give it an advantage when negotiating pan-European contracts It already has multi-site contracts to supply to Accor hotels and Henkel the German chemicals company EdF nevertheless faces an uphill task in building a truly coherent and profitable European business a problem demonstrated by the potentially costly commitments it has made in Italy EdF has secured 18 per cent of Italenergia which controls the power company Edison but EdF's voting rights have been reduced to 2 per cent because of official Italian outrage at the French invasion Under a complicated set of options deals to reduce the debt of Fiat its partner in the venture EdF may be obliged to buy most of the rest of Italenergia for some {XEU}3bn in 2005 without necessarily gaining management control It is also guaranteeing a {XEU}1bn loan to Edison According to EdF executives the nationalistic protests in Italy and elsewhere in Europe will be defused by two dramatic changes in the next few years First EdF is likely to be partly privatised by the French government And second European electricity markets including France's will be liberalised in 2004 for all commercial customers For EdF's rivals however the French electricity giant will still be unfairly profiting from its monopoly of household supply and from continuing links with the powerful French state EdF's aggressive investment strategy in other words will still not get an easy ride in Europe ,1
2002-06-07, An application by Dr Reddy's Laboratories to produce a generic version of Plavix a blockbuster treatment for stroke victims generated a predictable threat of litigation aimed at one of the leaders of India's generic pharmaceuticals market Sanofi-Synthelabo the French maker of Plavix and the rival with most to lose from competition to the drug's $1 1bn annual US sales accused Reddy's of patent violation and instructed its lawyers to take action This is a familiar tale from India's $4bn generic drugs industry one of the biggest by volume in the world copy a drug and then produce it 70-80 per cent cheaper Years of generic production have created an aggressive attitude to patents in India G V Prasad chief executive officer of Dr Reddy's one of the country's largest generic manufacturers describes the approach as creatively overcoming patent blocks The reward can be lucrative Last year Dr Reddy's first to file move in the US was rewarded with 180-day exclusivity on Eli Lilly's off-patent drug Prozac which earned the company $56m in six months Dr Reddy's says it has several more patent challenges in its armoury While competitive generic drugs have formed the backbone of India's pharma sector the development of new treatments is emerging as a new growth area We want to emerge as a discovery-led company says Mr Prasad Dr Reddy's a pioneer in research in India says it has discovered nine molecules with medicinal activity licensed three to western drug groups for latter-stage clinical trials and is negotiating the licensing of the rest Indian companies are being forced to change their strategies because new global patent product rules will from 2005 prohibit copying patented drugs Domestic manufacturers have been copying drugs with impunity since an Indian law dating from the 1970s scrapped recognition of foreign drugs patents The aim was to allow the local production of cheap drugs in a country where modern medicine still reaches only a quarter of the population However in May legislators approved a new patent law designed to bring India into line with World Trade Organisation rules But foreign and top Indian companies are disappointed because they argue the changes fall short of WTO standards and are open to abuse Ranjit Shahani chief executive of Novartis in India and president of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers in India says a tough patent regime is crucial to protect discoveries boost innovation and attract foreign investment Just 1 1 per cent of foreign direct investment goes into the pharma industry where drug discovery costs are just 5 per cent of levels overseas Moreover Indian scientists are abundant and globally admired Most of India's 22000 licensed generic drugs-makers are small with annual revenues of less than $5m Just over 110 plants match global standards and barely 20 have approval from the US Foods and Drugs Administration to sell in the world's largest drugs market Only a handful have a credible research arm and only a small elite is likely to meet the challenge of 2005 by discovering patenting and marketing novel drug molecules The rest will continue to make commoditised drugs either generically or under licence to a patent holder The graduation from copycat producer to drug discoverer is best illustrated by the progress of Dr Reddy's This week Dr Reddy's announced a 217 per cent rise in net profit to Rs4 6bn $94m for the year to March mostly on the back of growth in generic sales in the US which remains the focus of attempts to gain scale Its R&D spending totalled 6 3 per cent of revenues three times the Indian average but two-thirds less than levels in the US and Europe The disparity puts even the biggest Indian companies at a disadvantage because the cost of research and clinical trials is beyond their means companies such as Dr Reddy's must license discoveries to western drugs majors reducing their payback Dr Reddy's which raised $133m from an American Depositary Share issue on the New York Stock Exchange last year could return to the capital markets to scale up R&D But the company does not want to commit risk capital on research that may fail to deliver preferring to use cashflows The financial conservatism contrasts with the pioneering move into research by the founder-chairman Dr Anji Reddy In 1994 Dr Reddy's move was regarded as commercial suicide but inevitable says Mr Prasad The benefits are beginning to trickle through Dr Reddy's three experimental medicines molecules have been licensed to Novo Nordisk of Denmark and Novartis of Switzerland whose final-stage clinical trials should net Dr Reddy's about $72m in milestone and upfront payments Innovation is where long-term value lies says Mr Prasad ,2
2002-06-24, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is facing another write-off of more than $1bn following a legal setback suffered in the US at the end of last week by Gemstar-TV Guide The company which is 42-per-cent owned by News Corp lost a landmark patent case that looks set to undermine its efforts to become the central provider of on-screen television guides in the era of interactive TV News Corp has already written off $4 2bn of its investment in the struggling Gemstar this year marking the biggest loss it has suffered from investments made during the stock market bubble News Corp had hoped that a successful outcome to the legal case would have buoyed Gemstar's share price and reduced the need for another big charge against its own profits However Gemstar's defeat is instead set to add to the pressure on the company's stock when trading resumes today presenting News Corp with the spectre of another big writedown Even before the legal ruling came out on Friday Gemstar's shares had fallen to $8 20 well below the $15 at which they are carried in New Corp's books At Friday's close the News Corp stake was worth nearly $1 4bn compared to the $2 55bn at which it is valued in the company's accounts While representing another financial setback however the legal ruling could aid Mr Murdoch in what has turned into a struggle for control of Gemstar with Henry Yuen the company's founder chairman and chief executive Under a deal reached when he merged his TV Guide magazine with Gemstar two years ago Mr Murdoch agreed to leave control in Mr Yuen's hands until the end of 2005 However the collapse in Gemstar's shares and questions about its accounting practices have brought tensions between the two men to a head This certainly hurts Mr Yuen's standing with his board and weakens his internal grip on the company said one person close to News Corp Mr Yuen's legal actions to defend Gemstar's patents have been among the most controversial intellectual property disputes prompted by the rise of the internet and interactive media His claims could put Gemstar in a position to charge royalties on interactive TV guides developed by rival companies However a judge for the US International Trade Commission ruled late on Friday that though Gemstar's patents were valid they could not be enforced against three companies that had been importing set-top boxes to the US ,2
2002-04-15, US investors in Grupo Televisa the Mexican media company may soon begin to question whether the stock should go in the emerging markets or the domestic section of their portfolios They can already buy Televisa's American Depositary Receipts in New York and watch its Spanish-language soap operas on the Univision Network a US company in which it has an equity stake Soon they will be able to attend Televisa-hosted concerts in Miami Chicago and Los Angeles Last week the company agreed to buy a 50 per cent stake in Cardenas-Fernandez & Associates a producer of Hispanic events in the US and the Caribbean Texas-based Clear Channel Communications owns the other half The deal expands an existing joint venture with Clear Channel and is an important step    as we increase our presence in the US said Jaime Davila executive vice-president in a statement It also highlights an important trend for ADR investors Mexican companies are increasingly looking and trading like their American rather than their Latin American counterparts Mexico is still an emerging market but    over time you're going to see more convergence with the US said Geoffrey Dennis Latin American equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney It's a long way away but maybe in time people will look at the Mexican market as an adjunct of the US market in a formal sense  Growing business links between the two countries including the North American Free Trade Agreement are a very important part of the story he added Cemex the cement company is a prime example It sold more cement in the US last year than it did domestically That ability to straddle the gap between emerging and developed status is why investors have flocked to Mexico The Mexican stock market which rose steadily from the late 1990s gained nearly 16 per cent in dollar terms last year shrugging off a crisis in Argentina This year it is up another 17 per cent Grupo Televisa and its leading competitor TV Azteca have benefited from the boom with share price gains of 13 per cent and 20 per cent respectively year-to-date In March Televisa completed a $300m offering of 30-year bonds the longest-dated debt ever sold by a Mexican company And after last week's announcement its shares climbed another 4 per cent The favourable response did not surprise Mr Dennis They've been pushing into the US for quite some time simply because the US Hispanic population is growing very rapidly and it is a wealthy population compared to average income levels in Mexico he said It is a natural market for them  But Televisa's expansionary aims could backfire Its share price had so far outperformed because it's being treated as a Mexican company not a media company Mr Dennis said And there is currently little investor appetite for the latter America Movil recently had to cancel a private US offering of Empresas Cablevision the Mexico City cable provider in which Televisa holds a 51 per cent stake due to lack of interest Fund managers were wary of betting on a new media stock even if it was Mexican leaving America Movil to eke out a $200m domestic capital raising Analysts have mixed opinions on Televisa too JP Morgan Chase last week reiterated its long-term buy rating on the stock but Bear Stearns recently downgraded it from buy to neutral ,1
2002-06-08, French and German tele-communications investors have got used to the value of their holdings crumbling in the past two years But last week must have been one of the most miserable on record Shares in France Telecom fell 6 per cent to {XEU}17 30 by late trading yesterday an all-time low and a 17 per cent drop on the week Orange its separately listed mobile arm also a sank to a low down 3 8 per cent to {XEU}5 36 Deutsche Telekom's stock meanwhile repeatedly crashed through its lowest level since its 1996 initial public offering By late Frankfurt trading yesterday the shares were down 4 8 per cent to {XEU}10 14 While concern about the groups' ability to reduce their debt mountains is hardly new recent events have raised alarm among investors by suggesting the two might be forced into rights issues DT shocked analysts late last month when it reported a 16 7 per cent drop in ebitda at its domestic fixed-line business a unit that had generated more than 80 per cent of DT's positive free cash flow in 2001 If the fixed-line slowdown was taking place at such a rapid rate the reasoning went DT might not be able to use its cash flow to meet its debt reduction targets While the group has stuck to its target of cutting net debt from {XEU}67 3bn £46bn to {XEU}50bn by the end of 2003 several analysts think it could be forced to tap the equity market next year The unease has been exacerbated by the twice-delayed launch of a jumbo bond the downgrade of DT's rating outlook and its failed bid for a government contract France Telecom's predicament is even greater Its net debt stood at {XEU}60 7bn at the end of last year but its market capitalisation was {XEU}20 31bn last week against {XEU}42 7bn for DT On Thursday Eon exercised such an option forcing it to pay {XEU}950m for its 2 1 per cent stake in Orange The main risk is its exposure to MobilCom a German mobile operator in which it has a 28 5 per cent stake France Telecom is negotiating a takeover of MobilCom that could see it issue to MobilCom's banks {XEU}4 7bn in bonds to be converted into France Telecom shares  Gerhard Schmid chief executive of MobilCom yesterday emerged unscathed from an attempt by several board members to oust him MobilCom directors failed to gather the two-thirds majority needed to dismiss Mr Schmid at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board yesterday despite his admission last week that he had violated German securities law ,2

2002-06-18, UK DIY Do-it-yourself companies are behaving like London buses After forcing investors to wait for a company offering pure exposure to the UK's fastest-growing retail sector three have come at once Focus Wickes yesterday set its flotation price range Homebase another private equity-backed business is coming later in the year Kingfisher is meanwhile planning a £2bn rights issue to buy the 45 per cent it does not own of Castorama Europe's biggest DIY chain Focus has picked its moment well It is first in the queue and can point to a like-for-like sales jump of 12 per cent in the quarter to the end of January But it is asking investors to take a lot on trust Growth is bound to slow with the housing market More importantly it is promising big improvements from integrating its acquisitions Even if management can achieve the expected cost savings there are questions over Focus's medium-term outlook when faced by an expansionary market leader in Kingfisher's B&Q Much of the future financial improvement is factored into Focus's price At the middle of the 230-290p price range the group would trade at a premium to Kingfisher and the general retail sector for 2002 This looks better value by 2003 As long as Focus achieves the expected 20 per cent pre-tax profit improvement it turns into a discount But with a limited history of clean numbers to go on and other DIY investments queueing up behind investors should step aboard with caution ,2
2002-06-17, It has been a difficult week for Arminio Fraga president of Brazil's central bank Fears of a leftwing victory in October's presidential elections have sent tremors through financial markets pushing bond prices last week to their lowest levels since March 1999 At that time Brazil was emerging from the trauma of devaluation and Mr Fraga fresh from directing hedge funds for George Soros arrived at the bank and helped soothe investors' fears Last week the government was forced further to tighten fiscal discipline buy back $3bn £2bn of its debt and draw on a $10bn credit line from the International Monetary Fund to help defend the currency Yet there is little sense of a crisis in Mr Fraga's office on the 22nd floor of Rio de Janeiro's central bank building Dressed casually in slacks and loafers Brazil's central bank president appears as calm as ever We didn't expect this much anxiety he admits But pointing to Brazil's strong fundamentals inflation under control and a primary fiscal surplus he says the markets were overshooting and that if the incoming government persisted with cautious policies risk premiums would decline I don't see why the next president won't make an effort to calm people down says Mr Fraga He would score an easy goal  Critics however say the central banker has lost the sure touch that has helped Brazil stabilise its financial system and secure a reputation as favoured destination for foreign investors They argue that Mr Fraga's inability to bring down interest rates has contributed to slow growth and strengthened the popularity of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the former militant trade union leader who on the evidence of opinion polls is the most likely winner of the forthcoming presidential contest The government set too ambitious an inflation target of 3 5 per cent and then unnecessarily created inflationary pressure by freeing up petrol prices and increasing public utility rates they argue Worse the bank stands accused of contributing directly to the recent slide in Brazilian financial markets For example its decision at the end of last month to tighten the regulation of mutual funds by bringing forward a deadline by which managers had to mark the value of bond holdings to market levels crystallised losses and contributed to the scale of the sell-off Other moves such as the introduction of a new bank clearing mechanism also made the markets nervous Economists in the Lula team have been at the forefront of the attacks But even government allies say the moves were politically naive It was absolutely right to do this but they treated this as a normal year They didn't perceive that society has lots of problems says Luis Carlos Mendonca de Barros former minister of industry and commerce Mr Fraga however staunchly defends the decisions particularly the mark-to-market measures which simply apply an accounting regulation that has been on the books since 1996 He says that it became imperative to enforce the regulations because their uneven implementation was creating opportunities for traders to arbitrage between funds We were blamed incorrectly Had we not done it we would have had a major problem says Mr Fraga arguing that inaction would have led to greater difficulties later Criticism of the government's debt issuance strategy is equally misplaced he argues Recent decisions to shorten debt maturities have left the new government facing a heavier financing burden in its first few months in office But Mr Fraga says the central bank had earlier extended debt maturities in order to give itself extra space if as has occurred volatility increased in the run-up to elections Mr Fraga admits however that much will depend on the elections Further tough fiscal and monetary policy from the new government will be essential to restore credibility He accepts that there may be some room for tweaking inflation targets but rejects the kind of radical amendments mooted recently by the opposition There are some good ideas but I like plain vanilla  Meanwhile there is a chance Mr Fraga could himself be part of a turnround Earlier this year it seemed possible that he would be leaving at the end of the year even if Jose Serra the candidate backed by the present government won the October poll But last week Mr Serra said he would invite Mr Fraga to stay on Mr Serra is trailing badly in the opinion polls but if his ratings start to improve expect some more irrepressible optimism from Mr Fraga We are targeting investment grade As much as that sounds Pollyannaish overly optimistic in days like this that's where we are going to ultimately ,2
1998-04-04, Fleming Investment Trust Management this week announced the most radical steps yet taken by a manager to try to cut the discount between its funds' share prices and the value of the underlying assets It called a meeting of 80 non-executive directors of its trusts to recommend that they all agree to buy back their shares where appropriate Fleming which manages 19 trusts with £4 7bn of assets also told the directors they should consider doing more to attract private investors While a number of individual trusts have bought back shares on wide discounts in recent months this is the first time a group has adopted a wholesale buy-back approach The attractions of a buy-back are twofold First it should enhance net asset value since the trust is purchasing its assets at a discount to their actual worth Second the reduction in the supply of shares in circulation might reduce the discount although there is a continuing debate among investment trust experts about whether this really happens in practice Nonetheless most analysts applauded Fleming's initiative Fleming also highlighted the growing division between private investors and the big institutional investors such as insurance companies which still own about half of the £60bn investment trust sector Daniel Godfrey of Fleming said these institutions hold the shares for historical reasons and are inhibited from selling by gains tax or discounts    it is quite apparent now that the natural shareholder for most trusts is retail This split between private and institutional shareholders was also apparent in the latest moves in the battle over Baring Tribune investment trust Private shareholders were instrumental in voting down proposals to convert it partially into a unit trust But while the proposals were defeated the institutional investors which put them forward re-main likely to win the day In spite of the vote Baring Tribune's board said it would put forward reconstruction proposals by the end of this month These proposals are almost certain to offer investors a cash exit at close to the trust's net asset value The attack on the trust has drawn in management groups keen to take over its £358m of assets Legal & General has proposed changing the trust into one that tracks the UK stock market while Fleming Claverhouse a big UK investment trust said it had put proposals to Baring Tribune's board which could lead to an agreed bid ,2
2002-06-28, Share prices in the leading UK telecommunications operators rallied yesterday as investor concerns about an accounting scandal in the UK telecoms industry receded BT Group closed up 1p at 242p with shares in MMO{2} BT's former mobile business up 10 per cent at 42{1/4}p Vodafone closed up 2 per cent at 88{1/2}p However shares in Cable and Wireless came under renewed pressure falling almost 3 per cent to 163{1/4}p-their lowest level since May 1988 Analysts said the fall was largely down to ongoing concerns at C&W Global the group's lossmaking web-hosting business But concerns over accounting standards may have also hit the stock according to analysts A report published this week into the telecoms operator by the Center for Financial Research a US-based accounting research organisation is understood to have focused on C&W's practice of booking sales of so-called capacity swaps as revenue in the year that the swap takes place rather than spreading the revenue over the term of the agreement In the last financial year C&W booked £229m of capacity sales as revenue C&W's practice is allowed under UK GAAP rules and therefore complies fully with standard accounting rules Separately in order to comply with US GAAP the telecoms operator strips out capacity sales from its revenue line But accountants said all aggressive accounting techniques were likely to come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the WorldCom fraud There is not one telco in Europe that is not consulting its advisers for a review of their accounting practices a telecoms accountant at a big accountancy firm said yesterday There are lots of non-executive directors running scared ,2
2002-04-18, Measures to help small breweries compete effectively for their fair share of the beer market were announced by the chancellor yesterday For more than 20 years the nation's small brewing industry and real ale drinkers have been calling for the introduction of reduced rates of duty both to help brewers invest in the growth of their businesses and to compete with larger brewers when selling their products to pubs and other retailers Following consultation over the past year the government has decided to introduce a relief scheme for small brewers this June in time for the start of the World Cup Under this scheme brewers producing up to 500000 litres about 3000 barrels or 900000 pints per year will receive a 50 per cent cut in duty equivalent to £40 per barrel they produce Brewers producing up to 3m litres a year will receive progressive rates of relief worth more than £120000 to each brewer equivalent to a 50 per cent cut on the first 500000 litres they produce Nine out of every 10 brewers in the UK will benefit including all micro brewers and local brewers the majority of which are based in rural areas Some of the eligible brewers already own their own village pubs and many others are expected to use the savings from the scheme to buy one Similar duty relief schemes operate in seven other European Union states with strong brewing heritages including Germany and Belgium but the UK scheme will be one of the simplest and most generous with the 50 per cent relief for the smallest brewers the maximum available under European law More than 100 MPs signed a motion calling for the introduction of a relief plan although the cost of the scheme at £15m is more generous than the one they had proposed The scheme is supported by the Society of Independent Brewers the Campaign for Real Ale the Village Retail Services Association and the Council for the Protection of Rural England Since 1997 the government has taken steps to deliver a fairer balance in the burden of taxation falling on different alcoholic drinks and on different types of drink producers ,3
2002-06-20,  Salary Last year Sir Christopher received a base salary of just under £1 2m His salary for the current financial year is understood to have been set at a similar level  Special bonus from 2000 Sir Christopher will receive the second half of a controversial £10m bonus first flagged in 2000 after dealmaking successes However as a concession he has committed to holding on to these shares for at least 12 months  Share options Sir Christopher will be awarded share options worth seven times his basic salary The strike price will be the closing price of Vodafone shares on July 31 Based on the group's current share price this should give him 9m share options To earn his full entitlement to these options Vodafone must achieve earnings per share growth of 15 per cent annually on top of retail price inflation However Sir Christopher will still receive a quarter of these options with a less demanding EPS target growth of 5 per cent a year on top of RPI  Deferred share bonus Deferred share awards could be worth in excess of £1 8m to Sir Christopher if all performance targets are met Vodafone estimates its deferred share bonus will account for 22 per cent of Sir Christopher's total remuneration To achieve his basic entitlement to the deferred shares worth about £1 2m Sir Christopher must beat undisclosed one year growth targets based on ebitda free cash flow and average revenues per user A separate award which can increase the total deferred share bonus by 50 per cent will be achieved if Vodafone meets additional earnings per share targets  Performance shares Performance share awards are worth a maximum of £2 1m Vodafone estimates performance shares could account for 18 per cent of Sir Christopher's total package if all targets are met To achieve this award in full Vodafone's share price performance must be in the top 20 per cent of a basket of leading global telecoms companies ,2
2002-04-17, The last time Riccardo Muti appeared with the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center the city was abuzz with anticipation Everyone knew that the charismatic Italian was a prime candidate to succeed Kurt Masur as chief conductor Most observers were delirious some merely excited at the prospect A fastidious musician and lofty idealist Muti is universally celebrated for his discerning taste his passion his poetry and yes his dazzling technique It doesn't hurt that he looks compelling on the podium in an old-fashioned darkly romantic way Moreover he knows how to communicate his ideas with rare elegance precision and economy He could have proved a useful antidote to the often pedantic essentially professorial Masur In any case it was not to be In July 2000 the maestro officially rejected New York He reportedly preferred to focus his primary energies on La Scala in Milan seconded by activities in Berlin and Vienna To the dismay of many critics both amateur and professional the New York Philharmonic turned instead to Lorin Maazel a seasoned virtuoso more noted for flashy routine than for inspiration or profundity Last week Muti returned for a two-week engagement as guest-conductor Within minutes of the initial downbeat last Friday everyone on stage and out front became sadly aware of what might have been The first half of the programme was devoted to Schubert's Sixth Symphony a jeu d'esprit completed when the precocious composer was 21 The Philharmonic hadn't discovered it until 1964 146 years after the premiere On that occasion the genial Josef Krips imbued the essential lyricism with Viennese lilt overtly sentimental and presumably echt Quite legitimately Muti chose to stress the Italianate influence of Rossini enforcing exuberance that never precluded grace and melodic expansion predicated on finesse The performance was warm dapper charming yet perfectly balanced astonishingly precise The orchestra sang like a wondrous bel-canto chorus we don't often hear anything like that at Avery Fisher Hall and Muti took the composer's most fastidious dynamic markings very seriously From time to time he paid his players the ultimate compliment allowing them to move along without overt instructions It was illuminating and it was reassuring After the interval he turned with equal parts of conviction and bravado to the gloriously over-ripe pathos of Scriabin's First Symphony With an unerring sense of propulsion and proportion Muti made the meandering excesses seem almost organic In the process he somehow got the Philharmonic to play the complex score as if it were just six easy pieces The feat proved doubly remarkable because the orchestra had ventured this challenge only once before and that was in 1907 Larissa Diadkova's lush mezzo-soprano and Sergej Larin's vibrant tenor lent authentic character to the swollen rhetoric of the finale Martin Bernheimer Lincoln Center New York Tel 1 212 875 5030 www lincolncenter org,3
2002-06-20, For once the UK competition authorities have managed to please everybody Yesterday's decision to clear the proposed P&O Princess/Royal Caribbean merger inches the deal a step closer to realisation But it also gives some cheer to Carnival the world's biggest cruise company whose rival bid for Princess is being scrutinised in Brussels The European Commission objects to Carnival's bid because of its potential impact in the UK and Germany It is understood to want significant disposals But the recent reversal in the courts of its decision to block Airtours' acquisition of First Choice in 1999 after it failed to take full account of work by the UK authorities might make it think twice before reaching a verdict on Carnival The complex yet vital arguments about market definition were skirted by yesterday's UK decision They will rumble on in Europe providing ammunition for spin doctors on all sides But they remain a sideshow The real battle will be fought in the US There the market is much more concentrated and mature Allowing either deal to go through would reduce the number of big competitors from three to two Investors clearly believe Princess has little chance of winning approval for either transaction The shares are trading at a discount of about 30 per cent to Carnival's offer and on 12 times next year's earnings have no benefits from the Caribbean deal factored in Carnival could yet retain its crown without being forced to pay a heavy dowry for its Princess ,1
2002-04-15, Despite the resurgence in world oil prices and recent increases in domestic gas and power prices Russian energy has been beset by low prices which discourage output and encourage wasteful consumption The current slump in domestic oil and oil products prices however is largely due to Russia's decision to co-operate with Opec in the first half of this year in restraining exports Its co-operation was widely thought to be cynical symbolism since it consisted of taking last year's export level at its traditionally high level in the third quarter and promising to reduce it by 150000 barrels a day during the first quarter of this year when winter weather always restricts shipments Yet the government has now extended its co-operation with Opec for the second quarter provided world oil prices do not climb higher The 70 per cent drop in domestic crude prices in the past three months at a time when the economy is growing shows the export restraint has been real it has created a glut at home Prices will recover later this year when Russia and probably Opec itself ceases to restrain production and exports though the temporary dip in prices may encourage further consolidation The oil industry is already dominated by 11 large vertically integrated companies which account for nearly 90 per cent of crude production and nearly 80 per cent of refining However there is still scope for more consolidation in several directions First many of the 100 or so small independents producing less than 10m tonnes of oil a year will probably end up in larger groups Second the government is due to sell 20 per cent of the Slavneft oil company one logical bidder would be Tyumen Oil TNK which already has a 12 per cent stake in Slavneft The government is also to sell 6 per cent of Lukoil to foreign investors Still 100 per cent in state hands is Rosneft but its assets are largely those that no one wanted in earlier privatisations The third possibility is consolidation among the larger integrated companies though for the moment they seem more interested in linking up with foreigners than with each other Lukoil and Yukos respectively the number one and two oil companies are actively looking for downstream acquisitions in central Europe from the Baltic to the Balkans Sibneft is focused on using the expertise of western oil service companies to improve recovery rates at home in Siberia TNK meanwhile gives the impression of being ready to sell out to a western producer such as BP But there is a performance gap opening up within the Russian oil companies which could lead to better-managed companies taking over the worse-managed ones Yukos and Sibneft for instance have lower production costs and higher growth rates than Lukoil and Surgut This is one reason why the former disagrees with Opec on the need for production restraint and the latter sides with Opec One of the reasons for the surge in Russian oil production is that domestic prices are not too divorced from world levels Though much lower now the domestic crude price is at between $5 and $6 a barrel still about a quarter of the world price Conversely a big factor behind the fall in Russian gas production is that domestic gas prices bear very little relation to export prices In the first half of last year the domestic price to industry itself higher than to households was $14 5 per thousand cubic metres according to the International Energy Agency IEA compared with the $136 per thousand cubic metres which Gazprom Russia's virtual gas monopoly could get by selling to western Europe Small wonder then that Russian natural gas production and domestic sales should have fallen Price reform is probably the single most important policy for gas and perhaps the entire energy sector in the first decade of the 21st century says the IEA in its latest Russian energy survey The government has laid out a plan to increase prices to European levels by 2007 But it is hard to see prices rising 250 to 350 per cent in 2003-05 compared with 2000 when increases of only about 20 per cent have been considered politically possible this year and last Another price which needs increasing is that paid to oil companies for the substantial quantities of gas which come bubbling up with their oil This so-called associated gas requires cleaning before being put into the Gazprom pipeline network In Siberia this has been done by Siberian-Urals Oil and Gas Chemical company Sibur But this subsidiary of Gazprom has offered such a low price for associated gas that many oil companies have preferred to flare it on the spot rather than gather and transport it to processing plants Gazprom has recently taken full control of Sibur charging the latter's top management with asset-stripping While Gazprom may not be interested in higher prices to entice foreign investors its electricity counterpart United Energy Systems UES is Again there is a plan to raise electricity tariffs by 160 per cent in real terms in 2003 and a further 160 per cent in 2005 in order to cover the long-term costs of generators to reward maintenance and to entice investment in new capacity However in contrast to Gazprom UES has at its head a man who is prepared to make room for foreign investors Anatoly Chubais the privatisation crusader of the Yeltsin era is pushing ahead with his plan to create competition in electricity This involves carving up UES which is 52 per cent owned by the government and 48 per cent by various Russian and foreign private investors A federal grid company has already been set up to run the high-voltage transmission system under the ownership and management of the state But UES' 72 regional energy generators are to be formed into separate companies to compete to supply the wholesale power market Eventually independent generators would be allowed to enter the market by getting non-discriminatory access to the state-run grid Some of these independent generators will be foreign hopes Mr Chubais We cannot wait until the end of the reform process to interest such investors  he says So in addition to signing a joint venture deal with Eon of Germany he is in talks with Electricite de France Enel of Italy Endesa of Spain and various US companies ,2
2002-06-12, Nokia helped buck up spirits on both sides of the Atlantic by saying yesterday it would meet its second-quarter earnings target As the details of the mid-quarter statement sank in its shares reversed their poor start and by the end of the day had built up a firm gain This leading blue chip stock closely watched on US as well as European markets is something of a symbol of the hopes of the technology bulls But this year already its share price has halved as investors have realised that improving economic data alone are not enough to support high valuations Thin trading means a single stock can exert a significant effect on market sentiment Yesterday France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom both soared higher The main US indices opened modestly stronger while the French and German ones closed firmly in the black The mood in the US was further supported by the wireless telecoms company Nextel Communications which said cash flow was looking stronger than it had previously thought Dell Computer helped with chief financial officer Jim Schneider saying they were sticking with expectations of sales growth for this quarter But in an illustration of the fragile nature of the picture Ericsson's shares already weak fell sharply lower as prospects for mobile networks deteriorated Ericsson's shares have not been this low since the summer of 1996 Tokyo managed its first rise in four sessions although uncertainty about Japanese corporate earnings capped the gains The uncertainty was further underlined by low volumes of trade Alex Skorecki,2
2002-06-25, US equities battled back from sharp losses with technology stocks leading the rebound as short-covering and some bargain hunting helped stop the sell-off in the indices The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 28 03 higher at 9281 82 after flirting with 9100 while the S&P 500 index gained 3 43 to 992 57 coming within a few points of its September 21 close The Nasdaq Composite fell below its September 21 low in intraday trading but the index recovered in the afternoon to erase its losses closing up 19 36 to 1460 32 Volume was heavy with 1 57bn trades in the NYSE It was an ugly Monday for the markets said Peter Cardillo chief strategist at Global Partner Securities who cited the US dollar which fell to its lowest level in more than two years against the euro as a main concern A weak dollar could spur overseas investments to leave US financial markets traders said Larry Wachtel market analyst at Prudential Financial said the move higher did little to erase the negative sentiment You need three or four plus days for Wall Street to say that this could be the real thing One day of gains does nothing  Drug stocks were among the worst performers with Merck down 1 per cent to $49 50 amid reports that the company increased its 2001 revenue through rare accounting methods not used by its competitors ImClone reversed losses up 2 5 per cent to $8 97 as the controversy involving Martha Stewart and alleged insider trading took another twist with a Merrill Lynch sales associate providing new information that contradicts what Stewart has said Shares of Gemstar-TV Guide tumbled 39 per cent to $5 after a judge ruled against the company in a patent infringement suit Tobacco stocks fell after RJ Reynolds was ordered to pay $15m in punitive damages to a smoker whose legs were amputated Philip Morris retreated 7 3 per cent to $48 80 while RJ Reynolds shed 9 5 per cent to $55 70 JP Morgan rose 0 6 per cent to $33 18 The stock was earlier pressured by a Wall Street Journal article that reported the company was being sued by 11 insurers on charges that it conspired to make Enron's financials look better than they were Federal Reserve policymakers meet today and tomorrow but are expected to leave rates unchanged at 1 75 per cent Economists now predict the Fed may leave rates at a 40-year low for the remainder of the year largely because of the slump in the equity market Toronto was unable to shake concerns over the outlook for corporate earnings The S&P/TSX composite index lost 0 13 per cent closing down 9 5 at 7129 93 ,2
2002-06-12, David Blunkett the home secretary has come under fresh fire after a Conservative peer likened his accommodation centres for asylum seekers to concentration camps and backbench Labour MPs protested about his plans In an interview with the Financial Times Lord Taylor of Warwick the only black Conservative in the Lords said the centres where refugees will be housed while their claims are processed were monstrosities The solution is not to herd everybody together in these great concentration camps which in effect will be like prisons he said in remarks that provoked consternation among British Jews Lord Janner Labour chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust said The concentration camps were death camps These accommodation centres are camps where people are brought together  Meanwhile Mr Blunkett announced concessions to appease Labour backbenchers angered by his proposals that asylum seekers' children should be educated in the accommodation centres rather than in mainstream schools He said asylum seekers would be able to demand a place for their children in local schools if they spent nine months in a centre The rebels did not get a chance to vote on their amendment to delete the education clauses because of a shortage of parliamentary time Later 17 Labour backbenchers rebelled against the government's plans aimed at deterring clearly unfounded claims by asylum seekers Room for improvement Page 6 Trying to hold the traffic Page 19 Observer Page 19 www ft com/uk,3

2002-06-05, Tyco International Having risen on last week's rumours of Dennis Kozlowski's demise Tyco has sold off on the reality At under $17 the stock is down 25 per cent from Friday's close The departure of Mr Kozlowski aside nothing has changed So that suggests an over-reaction Mr Kozlowski's departure does not necessarily make the task of floating or selling CIT by the end of this month any more difficult But assume that Tyco is able to offload CIT probably in a trade sale for the $5bn that Lehman Brothers offered to pay or less and so avoid a further downward spiral in confidence Assume too that it is able to sell plastics so that liquidity concerns fully recede The problem is that investors who had been waiting for CIT to be offloaded in order to exhale face a longer delay It is going to take time to appoint a new chief executive And it will take time for the new team to scrutinise the books decide on further restructuring articulate the strategy and rebuild the company's credibility The industrial assets and their cash-generating potential suggests there must be value in the bonds But uncertainty about the plans of the new management team including the likely credit rating it targets must be offputting for fixed income investors Excluding CIT Tyco is trading on a multiple of enterprise value to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation of about 6{1/2} times Applying peer group comparisons it is not hard to arrive at a sum of parts valuation of about $30 a share According to Deutsche Bank analysts in the extreme case of liquidation there should still be about $17 a share left for shareholders once the debts are paid If so the market is already discounting a miserable outcome It is going to take time for anyone to gain the confidence to expect something brighter ,2

2002-06-11, After an erratic morning on Wall Street US equities accelerated gains yesterday afternoon only to fall from their highs before the close Cautiousness pervaded trading throughout the day This sense was most palpable at midmorning when shares fell after John Ashcroft US attorney general said US agents in May arrested an alleged al-Qaeda member suspected of planning to explode a radioactive dirty bomb Shares then regained ground The basic theme of the market is hesitancy caution scepticism said Larry Wachtel market analyst at Prudential Financial The market's in the downtrend It will be punctuated by periodic flurries on an oversold short-covering basis but that's about it  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 55 73 at 9645 40 after climbing more than 120 points earlier in the session The S&P 500 index rose 3 21 to 1030 74 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 4 79 to 1530 69 Wal-Mart took the lead on the Dow up 3 6 per cent at $56 40 after the world's leading retailer said same store sales for June would be at the high end of its forecast Other large scale retailers also rose with Target up 1 4 per cent to $38 78 and K-Mart up 6 6 per cent at 97 cents Blue chip financials closed higher JP Morgan Chase rose 0 6 per cent to $33 88 Citigroup added 1 7 per cent to $41 70 and American Express was up 1 2 per cent $39 63 Shares of AT&T slipped 4 3 per cent to $10 91 Intel fell 4 2 per cent to $21 07 weighing on the Dow and Nasdaq Instinet put on 0 7 per cent to $7 10 after the company said it planned to buy rival Island ECN in a deal valued at $508m The electronic trading platform is majority-owned by Reuters Shares of Duke Energy fell 3 per cent to $29 09 after JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch downgraded the company Palm rose 22 1 per cent to $1 49 on news the handheld computer maker plans a Chinese-language version of its system within a year Tyco led trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange Shares rose 12 9 per cent to $11 40 as the conglomerate's general counsel stepped down Merrill Lynch eased early losses to close down 0 8 per cent at $39 72 JP Morgan Securities downgraded the brokerage to long-term buy In Toronto the S&P/TSX composite index closed down 17 86 at 7460 71 a drop of 0 24 per cent Despite the lower close six of the TSX's 10 subgroups closed higher The information technology sector rose by 3 per cent but gold stocks tumbled by 7 per cent Shares in Nortel Networks rose by 32 cents to C$2 81 and Sierra Wireless gained 45 cents to C$7 40 ,2
1998-04-02, Hopes rose yesterday of an early end to Poland's first industrial stoppage in a large listed company with employee shareholders Officials of the Solidarity trade union started talks with management at the strike-bound Rudna copper ore mine The mine is the largest of the three at KGHM a copper combine which accounts for 3 5 per cent of world copper output Our minimum demand is that restructuring plans should be held up for a month said a spokesman for the strikers at the Rudna plant just before the talks were due to begin He explained that this would give time for the company's new supervisory board to examine the strategy The board was appointed recently by the new Solidarity-led government which still holds 52 per cent of the company's equity The strikers have been demanding that management drop restructuring plans which centre on the gradual transfer of several thousand of KGHM's 20000 or so employees to lower-paid jobs in company-owned subsidiaries The strategy is crucial to continued profitability at the company which has been hit by a weak world copper price and the recent appreciation of the zloty In an apparent sharpening of the conflict which so far has affected only the 4400 workers at Rudna management warned yesterday that job cuts would follow if the strike continued But even before the talks began the KGHM share price rose yesterday on the Warsaw bourse by 9 5 per cent to reach 12 7 zlotys $3 70 per share The rise contrasted with an 8 per cent fall in the share price after the weekend when the miners voted for the strike These share price developments will have been keenly watched by the 37500 employees of KGHM and its subsidiaries as well as 11000 pensioners who were handed 15 per cent of the company's equity or 30m shares when it was floated in Warsaw and on foreign exchanges last summer Under the terms of the flotation the employee stake worth a total of $111m at yesterday's prices cannot be traded until July 1999 In many cases the stakes are considerable as 40 per cent of those entitled by length of service at KGHM to the handout received the largest possible allocation of 810 shares each worth 10287 zlotys at yesterday's price This compares with an average monthly gross wage at KGHM of 2500 zlotys KGHM reported a 485m zlotys net profit last year ,2
1998-04-02, Luxfer Group formerly British Aluminium exceeded its business plan target with a more than threefold increase in pre-tax profit to £21 1m but has shelved its planned listing on the London Stock Exchange The engineering and materials group was bought from Alcan of Canada by banks venture capitalists and managers in February 1996 for £202m Ian McKinnon chief executive said yesterday it still intended to list within five years of the buy-out but an immediate flotation was out of the question because the stock market was giving a poor rating to medium-sized engineering compan-ies Pressure for a flotation had eased because Luxfer was generating good cash flow and had been able to make three acquisitions from its own resources The main shareholders Mercury Development Capital Morgan Grenfell and CVC Capital Partners would also be willing to provide more capital The name change reflected both the increasingly international nature of the group's operations and the fact that the range of materials offered was wider than aluminium and was likely to grow said Mr McKinnon The strength of sterling was a problem but Luxfer expected continued progress In 1998 operating profit would be at least double the £26m for 1995 he said Operating profit last year increased 75 per cent to £41 3m on turnover ahead 1 7 per cent to £539 9m Net profit jumped from £2 7m to £14m All divisions reported increased operating profits gas cylinders from £6 7m to £11 9m Elektron zirconium and magnesium from £10 7m to £13 3m aerospace and speciality from £11 4m to £14 5m and engineering and consumer products from £4 1m to £5 3m The acquisition of CIG Gas Cylinders in Australia had provided an important manufacturing presence in the Asia-Pacific region Luxfer has also bought HD Plastics to broaden the range offered by its Baco Consumer Products offshoot and Hart Metal of Pennsylvania the world's main producer of atomised magnesium powder ,2
2002-06-24, Plans to pump up to £8bn more into the railways for rising maintenance costs and project overruns could be announced this week by Alistair Darling the transport secretary The statement will accompany a government-backed bid to buy Railtrack the collapsed rail infrastructure company out of administration Railtrack Group is expected to relist its shares on the London Stock Exchange after they were suspended at 280p when the rail business was declared insolvent last October Last week Financial Spreads the spread betting company raised its target price set by the first trade from 205-210p to 220-225p The group hopes to recover 240p per share from bids for the infrastructure business part of the Channel tunnel rail link property and cash The bid by Network Rail a not-for-dividend company is expected to offer Railtrack shareholders £500m for the infrastructure business Mr Darling will later publish details of the government's support including up to £5bn in direct grants and £3bn loan facilities to cover the increased cost of infrastructure maintenance and overruns on upgrade projects especially on the west coast mainline The funding will be used to pay for any extra cost over that approved by the rail regulator in a review of Network Rail's income Currently Railtrack estimates the total needed for extra maintenance over five years and the west coast project is more than £13bn but industry leaders and Network Rail hope to reduce that figure considerably However whether the extra money is paid through income granted by the regulator or direct grants or loans government insiders admitted it would eventually come from the public purse That's always where it would have had to come from said one person close to the negotiations The Department for Transport through the Strategic Rail Authority has agreed to provide £300m cash and support for £200m debt for the original purchase The SRA will also underwrite a bridging loan of £9bn to repay Railtrack's creditors and finance the business in the short term and then a smaller contingency fund A deal had been expected today but last night insiders said it would be delayed because of complications with the bid for the Channel tunnel link ,1

2002-06-26, Argentina's economy minister Roberto Lavagna yesterday flew to Washington amid growing signs that talks with the International Monetary Fund over a desperately-needed aid programme have become hopelessly bogged down Mr Lavagna is due to meet a range of economic officials including Paul O'Neill US Treasury secretary and Anne Krueger number-two at the IMF But before his departure senior Argentine officials said he had nothing new to offer the lending body to speed talks along Both Mr O'Neill and Ms Krueger have taken a hard line with Argentina since the IMF cut off aid in December pushing the country into the largest debt default in history Last week Mr O'Neill indicated that the US would take the same approach with neighbouring Brazil which is suffering acute financial jitters in the run-up to its presidential elections Senior US and Argentine officials say privately that the six-month-old talks with the IMF have effectively run aground with the two sides still far apart over core issues such as the elimination of provincial bonds that in Argentina are being used as quasi-currencies Yesterday a World Bank official also cast doubt on whether an agreement with Argentina was in the works The fund had a mission in Argentina that left a day or so ago without much progress David de Ferranti vice-president for Latin America told journalists at a briefing in the Netherlands according to Dow Jones Newswires I wish it were possible to say that there was a solution that would be soon to occur but that is not obvious yet  If Argentina cannot reach an agreement with the IMF by the second half of July it may have to default on its loans to multilateral lending agencies which would isolate its economy At that point some analysts say the country would not have access to financing to conduct imports or exports and might be reduced to Soviet-style barter for essential goods and services The negotiations have also been complicated by the departure of Mario Blejer as head of Argentina's central bank Mr Blejer who had worked at the IMF for 20 years helped bridge the deep distrust between the two sides Yesterday Argentina's president officially appointed Aldo Pignanelli formerly vice-president of the central bank to replace him rejecting an effort by the economy minister to install his own candidate However the economy ministry gained more control over the notionally-independent central bank by getting its candidate appointed to the board of directors and taking over its press office In his resignation letter Mr Blejer had complained about growing infringements on central bank independence by the economy ministry Now analysts say that much of the structure of the central bank has been filled by political appointees who respond to various parts of the executive branch The central bank has completely lost its independence said Rafael Ber head of Argentine Research a consulting group Yesterday Argentina's currency edged toward a new low of 4 pesos to the dollar hurt by the latest developments at home and financial turbulence in the rest of the region ,3
2002-04-27, The Neuer Markt Europe'sclosest answer to the Nasdaq goes from bad to worse Each week brings another piece of worrying news This week it was Thiel Logistik last week it was Phenomedia the week before itwas Comroad Some of the stories are pretty hairy The boss of Comroad a provider of traffic information systems is in custody charged with share manipulation Almost all the sales reported in its 2001 annual report did not exist The company has now been removed from the Neuer Markt Phenomedia a computer games developer also discovered that its accounts were inaccurate dismissed its management and ordered a special audit Thiel a Luxembourg-based logistics company has done nothing wrong but investors this week became worried about its management and the shares promptly fell 30 per cent Share prices on Germany's Neuer Markt have been shrinking alarmingly some almost to vanishing point The benchmark Nemax 50 index which peaked at more than 9000 is now about 900 The total market value is less than a quarter of what it was two years ago Of the 47 initial public offerings since August 2000 all but four are now lower than their issue price The worst media group Ejay is down 99 1 per cent Perhaps unsurprisingly there have been no flotations this year In 2000 there were 132 Frankfurt's Neuer Markt should have been celebrating its fifth birthday last month but the date passed quietly Will it recover in time to celebrate next year Will it even be around Rolf Elgeti market strategist at Commerzbank says most big investors do not look at the Neuer Markt any more Two or three years ago big fund managers would have put X per cent into blue chips and Y per cent into the Neuer Markt Now it is only small cap tech funds putting money in  He says even for the smaller investor stocks are too illiquid and too difficult to understand as an outsider But he adds that there are still quite a few interesting stocks and some very good investment options Michael Geiger analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston says the trouble is that some companies are still very young They are at the stage where the founder has much private wealth tied up If the company goes under the family money is liable to go too This is the turf where criminal activity can grow he says Geiger points out that rules on the Neuer Markt are tighter than for stocks on the main market Companies have to report quarterly for instance But this week Deutsche Borse owner of the Neuer Markt in a tacit acknowledgement of current problems announced a further tightening of the IPO code The Neuer Markt is partly suffering from its own previously inflated reputation Henry Reid of The Europe Company a brokerage specialising in small and mid caps says German private clients were victims of fashion He cites the example of Pfeiffer Vacuum a German maker of pumps that already had a US listing When the company announced in late 1997 it was going to join the Neuer Markt too the share price doubled Nothing about the company had changed just the news that those eager Neuer Markt investors were on their way Fund managers and analysts stress that investing is now very much a stock picking operation No one buys the whole market as they do the Nasdaq in the US Both Reid and Geiger mention Singulus a maker of compact disc and digital versatile disc machinery whose shares have gone up 30 per cent in the last two months There are good companies says Geiger One just has to pick them  But even Singulus is less than half its peak value of 2000 Europe's other new markets having launched with less of a buzz have also endured less punishment Italy's Nuovo Mercato has maintained a higher level of liquidity a measure of the amount of trading that takes place London's Aim has continued to attract new companies while the Neuer Markt is losing them David Spence international director of accountancy firm Grant Thornton thinks mergers are the way forward There needs to be consolidation of these new markets over the next few years he says However the prospects for the main exchanges themselves getting together are opaque enough let alone their smaller offspring Geiger remains sanguine about the Neuer Markt's future pointing out that even the Nasdaq went through a bad two or three years in its early days during the 1970s ,2

2002-06-24, No more than three months ago policymakers were celebrating the limited financial impact of Argentina's debt crisis in the rest of Latin America Today after another depressing week in the region it is beginning to look as if the champagne corks were popped too early Brazil has been at the centre of a storm sweeping through the region's markets Its bonds have been falling like a stone and on Friday prices dropped to their lowest levels since early in 1999 on political uncertainty before the October general elections and worries about debt According to JP Morgan's bond market index Brazil is now the world's second riskiest emerging market dicier even than Nigeria Indeed on this basis Brazil is now safer only than Argentina hardly much of a recommendation since Brazil's crisis-stricken neighbour is suffering the worst slump in its history In the 12 months to March 31 Argentina's economy already in its fourth successive year of recession declined by 16 per cent Argentina's economic decline is also affecting some smaller economies in the southern part of the region Paraguay and Uruguay are being hit because of trade and in Uruguay's case banking connections to Argentina Cash-strapped Argentine savers who have traditionally regarded the Uruguayan banking system as something of a safe haven immune from instability at home have been withdrawing their money Chile too has been affected partly because its companies that have ploughed money into Argentina face losses that could cut the rate of their ability to invest at home and hit growth And last week some investors seemed to think Argentina could even affect Mexico long viewed as insulated from events in the south of the region by growing integration with the US economy On Friday its currency fell to its lowest levels since January last year after comments on Thursday by Francisco Gil Diaz Mexico's finance minister drawing parallels between Mexico and Argentine public finances before its devaluation and default at the end of last year sent shivers through the market Mr Gil Diaz told a congressional committee that Mexico was using privatisation revenues to boost fiscal revenues just as Argentina had done In April three months after the meltdown in Argentina it seemed that Brazil had escaped any impact Its bonds then trading at 700 basis points over Treasuries were a top pick for investment banks At the Inter-American Development Bank conference Brazil was flavour of the month very firmly among a group of strong performers Mexico and Chile were the others whose fortunes were judged to be in sharp contrast to those of Argentina Three months on the picture is very different The strong opinion poll advance of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva the presidential candidate of the left-wing Workers' party for October's general elections has unsettled investors As spreads widened to 1000 at the beginning of June and 1700 last week fears have grown that Brazil's public debt burden already equal to 55 per cent of gross domestic product might not be sustainable even though it is mainly in local currency and held by domestic institutions Government officials from Mexico to Brazil insist there are no connections with the Argentine disaster Uruguay's president got himself into a diplomatic dispute after calling Argentine politicians a bunch of thieves President Vicente Fox said Mexico had absolutely nothing in comparison with Argentina Brazilian ministers insist on their strong economic fundamentals and one even invoked Blaise Pascal the 17th century French philosopher to criticise the market's irrationality arguing The markets had reasons that were unknown to reason itself  Pascal was talking about hearts  But the markets do not seem to care Bond prices in Mexico Peru and Colombia have fallen but not by much compared with Brazil Mexico last week was about 320 basis points over the US Most of Latin America has failed to benefit from the recent revival in enthusiasm for emerging stock markets Argentine-motivated risk aversion may be very different from the financial contagion of the mid- to late 1990s when investors were forced to unwind leveraged positions after events such as the Mexican devaluation in 1994 and Russian debt default in 1998 Indeed in Brazil recent bond market falls seem to have been aggravated by thin volumes and an illiquid market The worry though is that the impact of Argentina could be just as great as the earlier waves of panic especially in Brazil where the country's debt dynamics mean there could be something of a self-fulfilling element about the market's pessimism ,2
2002-06-14, You would think that by now all the big energy trading companies would have learned their lessons about phony disclosure and dubious games with their trading books But you would be wrong For a long time the assumption among sophisticated investors has been that while games can be played with earnings operating income is a real number It is the measure security analysts have preferred to use in recent years However it seems energy traders' creativity has extended to creating operating income out of accounting assumptions rather than actual sales The case at hand is Dynegy's first quarter results While the profit and loss statement shows a loss it also shows a positive operating income of $252m This would have comforted its banks which at the end of April agreed to a new $900m revolving credit facility With this facility Dynegy expects to have available liquidity resources including cash on hand and availability under recently renewed borrowing arrangements of approximately $1 4bn the statement said Dynegy believes this level of liquidity is sufficient to operate its business under any conceivable circumstance  But the reporting on its trading activities merits close attention The report says Customer and risk management activities controlled assets marketing and trading financial contribution increased 13 per cent to $169m in the first quarter 2002 compared to $149m in the first quarter of 2001  This is interesting The first quarter of 2001 was the height of the California energy crisis when prices for electricity were high and when trading volumes and margins throughout the energy industry were at a peak In contrast the first quarter of 2002 was a perfect storm with low and sinking electricity prices reserves for counterparty credit losses and little volatility So where did Dynegy's higher trading profits come from given that as its quarterly report states there were reduced opportunities from milder weather and weaker energy and economic fundamentals The credit must go to a financial innovation mark to model accounting You know what mark to market is the increase or decrease in the valuation of an asset or liability to reflect current market prices Mark to market makes sense when there is a liquid readily disclosed stream of prices But how do you value an asset when there isn't a market price at hand You use a value that is generated by a financial or economic model that incorporates your best estimates for the factors that determine a market price or will determine it in the future So if you have acquired say the right to buy electricity generating services in the years beyond 2005 you may not have a readily available market value for those services But with the aid of a staff economist you can come up with some mark to model estimate In the case of Dynegy's activities in the first quarter the company bought long-term supplies of electricity less than the cost of the fuel to produce them for a value equal to $624m on a discounted basis The payments for these supplies begin in 2005 As the quarterly says the supplies were acquired at a cost below that which would be incurred to build and maintain power generation facilities to provide such supply In other words the suppliers would eventually go broke selling at those prices Through the magic of mark to model however these contracts were turned into a profit of $138m which you can find by looking at the net fair value of marketing portfolio and subtracting the number for beyond 2006 from that for the previous quarter Presumably the company figured that by the time the electricity was delivered the price would rise to what the model says would be the cost of production The model assumes that commodity sellers are owed a living even in the new highly competitive market economy of power History suggests otherwise In any event the use of a model is inappropriate since there is a market price for electricity in 2005 and beyond and Dynegy just paid it Was this $138m material to Dynegy Look at its first quarter statement of operations It shows operating income of $252m After subtracting interest expense taxes minority interest expense other expenses and distributions to trust preferred securities and after adding other income of $36m the company had an income from operations of $115m But if you take away the mark-to-model income from the distant future you are left with a loss of $22m And that is before the loss from a change in accounting assumptions perhaps not the last such change of $256m There may have been some bankers who thought that with that change the era of accounting games had come to an end and who therefore signed up for that $900m revolving credit line You have to wonder will they see all of that again johndizard@hotmail com,2
2002-06-08, Elan There seems to be an echo of Roy Keane about Elan the Irish pharmaceuticals company The more it rants about the markets' view of it the more its share price which has underperformed global pharmaceuticals by 85 per cent this year collapses It does have some justification for lambasting its fair-weather friends In the go-go era they overlooked the accounting its off-balance sheet vehicles were detailed in last year's accounts But there are too many nasty coincidences to view the company with anything but scepticism When it says it is registering assets for sale with no immediate intent to sell them it strains belief That it may consider selling them when biotechnology stocks are so weak suggests urgency even if the amounts raised would be small Desperate times require desperate remedies yet the company declines to detail its covenants and six months seems a long time for Donal Geaney chairman to give himself to right the ship Elan is suffering from pipeline concerns byzantine accounts and weak corporate governance Now the cash crunch question has emerged On the face of it $1 4bn of cash on the balance sheet easily covers this year's maturities and the off-balance sheet vehicles can service their own debts Elan however plans to boost revenues through acquisition cash may also be side-swiped by disappointing asset sales and large potential debt claims from its off-balance sheet guarantees With a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation to boot this stock merits the Keane treatment ,2
2002-06-07, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AIRPORTS CHIEF THROWS DOWN GAUNTLET TO GOVERNMENT BAA the UK airports group is prepared to invest L50m to L65m in the financial rescue of National Air Traffic Services on condition that the government matches the equity injection with a similar contribution The government holds a 49 per cent stake in Nats Yesterday's confirmation that BAA is ready to assist in the rescue will be a relief to the government which has been severely embarrassed by Nats' serious financial problems so soon after last summer's controversial part-privatisation The method chosen by the government for the sell-off in the face of strong opposition within Labour's ranks and from the trade unions left Nats with a heavy debt burden which has become impossible to sustain following the slump in air traffic after September 11 Mike Hodgkinson BAA chief executive said the group's willingness to invest in Nats was also conditional on the air traffic control group gaining approval from the Civil Aviation Authority its economic regulator to raise the fees it charges air- lines for flying through UK airspace and on a satisfactory agreement with Nats' commercial bank lenders BAA had agreed to take part in the rescue to help ensure the safe running of Nats and to secure about L1bn of investment to add capacity and to modernise the system Mr Hodgkinson said BAA was not interested in taking over or sharing management control of Nats with the Airline Group The consortium of seven UK airlines including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic acquired a 46 per cent stake and management control of Nats last July for L50m As its price for joining the rescue BAA is insisting it make a virtually guaranteed return on its investment which will mean having economic preference over existing shareholders BAA is expected to make its investment through a quasi-equity device such as preference shares or a subordinated loan This would secure a financial return ahead of the ordinary shareholders namely the government and the airlines The government is being advised by Credit Suisse First Boston Nats by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney and BAA by Rothschild Observer Page 19 Lex Page 20 BAA upbeat Page 22,2
2002-06-12, Nokia's display of juggling skills continues Once again it has dropped its forecasts for sales of mobile phones once again however it has kept its operating margin in gravity-defying orbit above 20 per cent In the first quarter market share may have come under pressure but average selling prices came to the rescue This quarter the position has reversed average selling prices have fallen but Nokia expects its market share to increase to 38 per cent Much of this can be put down to skill Nokia continues to outshine its competitors in its management of costs balance sheet and marketing The drop in average selling prices this quarter is attributed to a shift in sales mix towards low end mobiles but Nokia has been able to offset this so far by better manufacturing efficiency In the second half as new GPRS models roll out Nokia expects average selling prices to improve Perhaps Other manufacturers are already managing to sell GPRS phones and there must be a suspicion that Nokia can no longer count on its products being head and shoulders above its rivals' And network sales continue to disappoint If there is any comfort it ought to come from valuation At 15 times 2003 consensus earnings Nokia is now cheaper than half the FTSE Eurotop 300 including stodgy consumer defensives such as Heineken or Diageo That consensus still looks very high however It is more likely to mean that defensives are expensive than that Nokia is cheap ,2
2002-04-04, David Hockman a leading figure in music publishing has teamed with HgCapital the private equity firm to bid for Boosey & Hawkes' music publishing division today The pair will be competing with Bob Wise head of Music Sales the London-based music publisher Boosey & Hawkes owns one of the world's most extensive catalogues of 20th century classical music including rights to compositions by Prokofiev Stravinsky Rachmaninov and Bartok Analysts estimate bids may range between £50m and £100m Mr Hockman who is a former chief executive of Polygram Music Publishing Worldwide and HgCapital are thought to be interested in acquiring Boosey's publishing division to expand it over the long term Boosey's publishing concern would be complementary to HgCapital's Eagle Rock Entertainment the media and music company in which it holds a controlling stake Music Sales and HgCapital both believe they can extract more profits out of Boosey's publishing business by marketing its catalogue more aggressively to film producers and advertisers Boosey's board rebuffed informal approaches from Music Sales for several years It finally decided to put the company up for auction after Music Sales approached its shareholders last September with an offer for both divisions of about £43m Universal Music International one of the world's biggest classical music publishers which had expressed interest in Boosey's publishing division said yesterday it would not participate EMI which is undergoing a restructuring is also understood to have left the auction process Final bids for Boosey's classical music catalogue are contingent on Boosey selling its instruments division Gresham Trust and Graphite Capital the private equity firms recently walked away from making an indicative offer It is thought that rivals 3i and Close Brothers are still interested in acquiring the division Deutsche Bank which is handling the sale of Boosey's two divisions extended the deadline from mid-March to today to give 3i and Close Brothers more time It is believed that Boosey is planning to use the proceeds from the disposal of its instruments division to pay off debt which could be as high as £60m Boosey has been crippled by accounting irregularities discovered at its US instruments distribution business two years ago It is expected to publish full-year results this month ,1
2002-06-21, Criticism of private equity as an asset class among institutional investors has grown in seemingly-inverse proportion to the money flowing into the sector in Europe Despite falling returns investors continue to pour money into the sector less than the heady peak of 2000 but the pipeline remains open Private equity funds raised in Europe declined from $48bn to $31 9bn last year according to a report by AltAssets Research However this was still well above the $25 4m in 1999 And there still seems scope to grow according to a survey of investors by Goldman Sachs the investment bank and Frank Russell the fund management consultants Its survey of 346 pension and other tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $3bn found that in Europe investors expected to increase the portion of overall portfolios dedicated to private equity from 2 5 per cent in 1999 and 3 6 per cent this year to 4 3 per cent by 2003 The world is divided into two halves at the moment In the US particularly in technology where investors have been hit hard it is still difficult says John Mackie chief executive of the British Venture Capital Association In Europe investor appetite is still strong  But the flow of funds in Europe is still at odds with investors' complaints about private equity Concerns continue to be raised even within the industry about declining returns transparency of performance low liquidity in the sector the level of fees charged and the skill level of private equity executives Alistair Ross Goobey the forthright former chief executive of Hermes Pensions Management struck a chord late last year when he accused private equity managers of failing to earn their fees He said high returns generated by many private equity managers over the past decade were largely the result of rising stock markets General partners at private equity firms typically earn annual management fees of between 1 and 2 5 per cent on commited funds and 20 per cent of the profits Some of the best names take 30 per cent of the profits These are hefty fees particularly given the falling returns and concerns about the slow pace by private equity groups to invest funds While the relative performance to the quoted equity market remains strong the stellar gains a few years ago from private equity seem to be diminishing The net return of private equity funds raised in the UK between 1980 and 2001 measured to the end of December was negative 7 1 per cent according to the BVCA This fall compared with a 13 3 per cent drop in the FTSE All-Share index over the same period Over the past three years the return was 13 0 per cent over five years 15 7 per cent and 10 years 17 4 per cent There are also doubts about the skill levels of executives involved Mr Ross Goobey criticised private equity firms for their hubris in assuming that most of their performance was a product of their own genius rather than of market conditions We have been paying pretty high fees without being confident people really earned them he said A survey by KPMG and Manchester Business School released last month also found private equity executives in Europe possess a set of skills that are anachronistic They are ill-equipped either to help their investments perform better or to spot trouble early enough according to the poll of senior executives from 24 private equity houses with a combined capital of £57bn under management Then there are concerns about the transparency of returns and performance The BVCA acknowledged this with its current plans to draw up an accounting standard to provide comparability and transparency in the opaque private equity world However despite all this institutional investors in Europe seem prepared to accept the increased risk and illiquidity in private equity for the potentially higher longer-term reward over the quoted market And increasingly funds of funds appear to be a growing vehicle of choice to enter the sector despite higher fees Mr Mackie says funds of funds are expected to continue to increase its share of allocations to the industry Currently he says it is around 15 per cent It would not surprise me to see this rise to more than 25 per cent in the next few years he says Andrew Mclaren head of UK equities at UBS Global Asset Management also says there may now be better opportunities in the private equity market Some of the froth has been blown off the market Some investors have had their fingers burnt which probably means opportunities for others and probably better fees he says However Mr Mclaren adds that some institutions might find it hard to justify increased exposure to the sector when they are moving portfolios away from equity into bonds ,2
2002-04-11, Government bond markets were mostly weaker yesterday as the spotlight turned to the stock market and a heavy flow of new corporate bond issues But there was continued demand for short-dated government bonds as investors hedged against a rising oil price The exception was the Japanese government bond market where prices rose as pension funds continued a buying spree after the start of the new fiscal year Investors were lured back to the stock market after recent falls There was also good news on the earnings front Sears Roebuck the retail giant raised its earnings targets and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 173 points In the US Treasury market the 10-year note fell {7/32} to 97{1/4} to yield 5 231 per cent and the 30-year bond dropped {7/16} to 95{3/8} with a yield of 5 697 per cent The two-year note was unchanged at 100{5/16} with a yield of 3 447 per cent Analysts said the conflict in the Middle East and Iraq's suspension of oil exports would continue to bolster short-dated securities in the US and Europe which remain well bid despite sell-offs elsewhere These issues would also have a large bearing on interest rates Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are being closely watched for any comment from senior policy-makers about the impact of the oil price on interest rate deliberations The Fed is expected to delay any move to lift US rates because a prolonged oil price rise would threaten the economy's emergence from recession Bill Gross the influential bond investor at the Pimco fund management house has advised investors to hold short-dated securities European markets tracked the US closely in the absence of local factors to influence the direction of the eurozone markets Two-year German schatz bonds continued to be bought in fairly modest quantities and the yield at just under 4 18 per cent is now at a three-week low The June 10-year German bund futures contract settled at 105 56 above the day's lowest in relatively light volumes In the cash market the yield on 10-year bunds was just over 5 18 per cent a rise of about 2 5 basis points The UK gilt market was also very quiet in the run-up to the Budget next week The June futures contract settled at 111 43 although it recovered a little in later trading as buyers emerged to push it back through the 111 50 support level In the Japanese government bond market the key June 10-year futures contract rose 0 03 to 138 42 and the benchmark No 237 10-year cash JGB gained 0 176 to 101 136 pushing the yield down by 0 02 to 1 37 per cent It's the beginning of a new fiscal year and buyers have new money allocations said Yayoi Ushikubo bond strategist at Daiwa SBCM Investors shrugged off news that Japan's money supply grew at its fastest pace in two years which was attributed primarily to continuing worries about the relative instability of Japan's debt-laden banks The market is now looking forward to the Bank of Japan's two-day policy meeting which began yesterday with results announced today The BoJ is expected to keep monetary policy unchanged ,2
2002-06-07, Steel lobby presses case US steel companies yesterday urged the US administration not to weaken protection against foreign steel by granting large exemptions from the duties imposed earlier this year The pressure came as a senior US official said that a second round of exemptions from the steel tariffs was set to be announced in the next few days The US has indicated that exemptions for European companies could soften the blow of the steel tariffs and the European Commission has agreed to delay any retaliation against the US until after the final exemption decisions next month But US steelmakers warned that large-scale exemptions could reverse the rise in domestic steel prices that has occurred since the tariffs were imposed in March Alan Wolff a lawyer for the US steelmakers said the US should not give in to the blackmail of EU threats to retaliate Edward Alden Washington,3
2002-06-17, For the first time in almost two decades France's rightwing electorate went to the polls yesterday to vote for a new unified movement bringing together almost all the main personalities in an arc from conservatives to liberals This unity helped ensure overwhelming support for the Union pour la Majorite Presidentielle UMP despite its poorly explained programme The burying of past rivalries to win control of parliament was a key element in the appeal of the right in last Sunday's vote and decisive in yesterday's second round run-off of the general elections The UMP now looks set to be one of Europe's most powerful groupings on the right It shares an important common denominator with Italy's Forza Italia as both are kept together by a dominant leader The UMP owes its strength and unity to the presence of President Jacques Chirac as head of state while Forza Italia is exclusively dependent upon the personality of media magnate and premier Silvio Berlusconi its founder With the elections out of the way the UMP will have to transform an election-winning instrument into a viable political party The UMP was only formed after President Chirac's re-election on May 5 to prevent another cohabitation with parliament controlled by the left Even at the outset of the presidential election campaign in February of rightwing politicians failed to find a strong enough reason to unite under the banner of the Union en Mouvement UEM Too many felt the UEM was exclusively a vehicle to promote President Chirac's re-election Only Mr Chirac's victory and the prospect of the right controlling parliament provided the impetus for the creation of the UMP last month The leading lights pushing for unity have been younger politicians including the interim premier Jean-Pierre Raffarin but behind the scenes Alain Juppe former conservative premier has pulled the strings The bulk of deputies in the new parliament and the most influential bunch of ministers have come from the Gaullist RPR founded by President Chirac Thus the new movement is a thinly disguised takeover of the mainstream right by a reinvented RPR The latter was never more than the means to promote a Chirac presidency Once he first secured the presidency in 1995 the RPR lost its importance and became enmeshed in rivalries over who should be President Chirac's dauphin The other mainstream parties of the right the liberal DL headed by Alain Madelin and the centrist UDF of Francois Bayrou were also denied a proper opposition role in the past five years because they too were under President Chirac's shadow This lowered their visibility and ultimately made the bulk more willing to merge into the newly formed UMP so as to have access to a slice of power Only Mr Bayrou chose to plough a lone furrow in the presidential and parliamentary elections breaking with several key UDF members but he has been squeezed as the general elections proved there was room for only one major party on the right and left The first issues to be decided will be who gets the nomination to head the National Assembly the leadership of the UMP group in parliament and the control of the movement's purse strings French party financing laws mean that the state funds will accrue over the next five years to the UMP since it was the movement under whose label most of the elected deputies were registered But this will only diminish the identity of the founding parties if the UMP acquires a coherent ideology At the moment it embraces old-fashioned Gaullist nationalists and EU integrationists alongside liberals and state capitalists ,3

2002-06-13, Fundamental tax reform is actually closer than it seems with the drive being to switch from Henry Simons' old income tax culture to a consumption tax culture This is visible in the rise in recent decades of savings vehicles such as Individual Retirement Accounts IRAs may be quirky fellows and they certainly affect populations unevenly If you are left-handed on Tuesday you qualify if you are right-handed on Wednesday somehow you don't But it is possible to regard these tax protection devices as a sort of benign virus spreading the culture of the consumption tax Everyone these days acknowledges that the current hybrid system is an abomination Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill's word and that somehow the rich wind up paying less than the not-rich and almost-rich But how to get a simpler more consistent system Along comes Fair Not Flat  a book that offers a vision of a tax utopia where we are all meant to donate together The book's author Edward McCaffery believes we should drop all those IRA limitations and make all of our savings life one grand-tax free IRA Mr McCaffery and I are tax buddies as he acknowledges in the book  This in effect is what Steve Forbes' flat tax does But rather than impose a flat rate on income Mr McCaffery advocates a progressive schedule The first $20000 of income is tax free The next $20000-$80000 faces a 10 per cent rate And so on up to income over $1m which is taxed at 50 per cent That is more than ten points higher than the top rate right now although in the McCaffery schedule the rate kicks in at a much higher point But the important point is you only pay those rates if you don't save You are allowed to subtract from gross income an unlimited amount of savings In the McCaffery plan millionaires can save themselves from the tax man not through their lawyers but by living like John Doe and saving and investing a lot This notion has its charms Under the McCaffery regime taxpayers can buy sell and trade assets as they deem fit enjoying the same benefits that the current IRA-eligible do Capital is not taxed multiple times as it is under the current system There is no step-up-in-basis nightmare to contend with and there is no cap-gains bother either The McCaffery plan also eliminates the estate tax Mr McCaffery is that rare bird a progressive who hates the estate tax He opposes it mainly on efficiency grounds noting that the revenue it raises is just about negated by the costs of collecting it He also calls the corporate income tax a wage tax in drag an accurate analysis since looking at the big picture it is workers and not ephemeral firms who shoulder that tax's load In many ways Mr McCaffery's programme is a way to arrive at a national sales tax This could be in theory very beneficial for the savings rate not to mention the interest rate What about borrowing To be consistent with its consumption theme the McCaffery system treats borrowing as income Since borrowing is just negative savings that makes sense When you buy goods on your Amex you pay tax then and there  Fortunately Mr McCaffery continues the current favourable treatment of home borrowing on the theory that this is a form of saving With this step he saves his programme from generating something like a Japanese culture where savings is all and people live in tiny houses My problem with this system is the progressivity Mr McCaffery defends his plan by arguing that it isn't all that progressive especially because people can opt to escape levies by saving That is not sufficient Work is for most Americans still one of the main ways they derive satisfaction It is also the way they decide how much to push up gross domestic product High marginal rates are a deterrent they prevent people from taking that one extra step and doing just a little more As it happens Mr McCaffery wrote another book Taxing Women  on the problems progressivity imposes on married couples The second earner is usually a woman and usually earns less than her spouse But her income is just enough to push the family into a higher bracket Effectively even though she earns less she is taxed at a higher rate than her husband In other words flat still remains the fairest way to go Note to Steve Forbes time to run again Tax law after all is not only about taking from the people we are it is also about allowing us to become what we want to become At very least Mr McCaffery takes an important first step in the systematic non-taxation of capital An especially valuable aspect of this book is that it dispenses with all the usual class rage The fact is that when we free up savings we do all of ourselves a favour ,3
2002-04-09, A long-standing pledge to put a penny on income tax for education investment could be shelved by the Liberal Democrats Matthew Taylor Liberal Democrats Treasury spokesman said yesterday that the party might not need to continue its most well-known policy if the government promised extra cash for education in the Budget Although the penny on income tax was included in the party's alternative Budget published yesterday Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme It may well be that we have now won this argument Labour said the money was not necessary before the election Now it appears that they accept that we were right all along  The penny on tax for education was one of the former party leader Paddy Ashdown's most distinctive policies Over the past decade it has distinguished the Liberal Democrats from Labour and the Tories However now that the government is to raise taxes to fund higher health and education spending the Liberal Democrats believe the policy may have outlived its usefulness The party's alternative Budget confirmed a pledge to introduce a 50p top rate of tax for people earning more than £100000 a year The money would raise an extra £4 4bn for health The dedicated health tax would pay for the recruitment of 4500 thousand doctors and more than 27000 nurses The party believes the National Health Service should not have to battle it out against other priorities in the spending round Mr Taylor said Gordon Brown's long-term prudence and short-term handouts had deprived the public services of much needed cash The party said it would invest an additional £3 1bn on education and £2 9bn on pensions ,3
2002-06-07, Legion revolt Alarm at the European parliament Legionella has been discovered in the hot water at its building in Strasbourg where the next session starts on Monday Action is being taken treatment with chlorine the shutting down of hot water supplies beware unwashed MEPs and so on But concern remains Dutch socialist Michiel van Hulten says there will be just 48 hours between new samples being taken and the session starting It would be highly irresponsible to go ahead as planned  Another argument for MEPs not to make the 350km trek from Brussels to Strasbourg and ammunition for those who argue the two-seat parliament business is ridiculous Van Hulten says legionella is the direct result of the Strasbourg building standing empty for all but four days every month So will the session revert to Brussels There are hurried meetings but the pro-Strasbourg lobby is strong The building could be falling down but we'd still have to go says one disgruntled official ,3

2002-04-27, After a promising start Wall Street suffered steady losses in morning trade as weak earnings news outweighed strong economic growth figures At midsession the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 28 23 at 10006 83 off its lows of the session The S&P 500 index shed 5 51 to 1085 79 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 20 66 to 1693 04 The US commerce department said the economy grew at aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 8 per cent in the first quarter the fastest pace in two years But the news was not enough to sustain a rally as the stability of the US economy remained in question In a separate report the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for April slipped to 93 0 from 95 7 in March Shares of VeriSign were the most heavily traded on the Nasdaq and fell 45 per cent to $10 On Thursday the internet address manager cut second-quarter earnings forecasts and said it would cut about 10 per cent of its workforce Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs among others cut recommendations Shares of JDS Uniphase were off 8 6 per cent at $4 60 after the company on Thursday reported a third-quarter net loss of $4 3bn and said it would cut 2000 jobs On the Dow Disney's losses accelerated by midday down 3 8 per cent at $24 06 after reporting a decline in sales and profits for the second quarter on Thursday Eastman Kodak which disappointed investors on Thursday fell 2 5 per cent to $32 36 American Express AT&T and SBC Communications each lost around 1 per cent Wal-Mart fell 1 4 per cent to $56 23 and Intel lost 1 6 per cent to $28 62 Elsewhere in technology Cisco Systems fell 1 5 per cent to $14 37 Applied Materials was off 3 9 per cent at $24 24 and Ciena fell 3 2 per cent to $7 50 Brokers and banks were steady in spite of news that the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an investigation into investment banking conflicts of interest Goldman Sachs put on 3 3 per cent to $79 60 after an upgrade from Merrill Lynch Tyco and Dynegy continued to slide after a bruising session for both on Thursday Tyco lost 4 7 per cent to $19 78 and Dynegy which is under an informal investigation by the SEC fell 15 9 per cent to $16 15 Toronto was lower at midsession pushed down by banks and consumer issues but railway stocks steamed ahead after a strong report from Canadian Pacific Railway The S&P/TSE 300 composite index was 0 4 per cent weaker at 7655 10 but Canadian Pacific managed a 2 8 per cent rise to C$33 40 ,2
2002-06-26, When Germany's ruling Social Democrat coalition introduced radical pension reforms at the beginning of this year they were expected to herald a bonanza for the financial services industry as Germans rushed to save for their old age Financial analysts held out the prospect of a German savings market that would grow by a mouth-watering {XEU}20bn-{XEU}40bn $19bn-$38bn over the next five years But six months on barely 6 per cent of the 35m Germans entitled to take out a private pension product have done so Only 1 9m policies have been sold though the government says several million more people are set to sign up for corporate schemes Banks insurers and other providers have been putting a brave face on the figures But their initial euphoria is rapidly giving way to disenchantment Allianz the giant insurer and Deutsche Bank are among Germany's elite financial institutions that have publicly criticised the reforms The common view is that the Riester pension products named after Walter Riester the labour minister who piloted the reforms through parliament are too complicated The law is so perfect that no one really understands it says one Frankfurt-based banker It is a typically over-engineered German product  To add to the gloom consumer groups have strongly advised the public faced with as many as 3500 different products to take their time before taking the plunge That advice is echoed by the government's own promotional brochures There is little opposition to the principle of reform It has been hailed as an epoch-making first step It is the first time in postwar Germany that part of the responsibility for pension provision has been shifted from the state back to the individual But the Riester reforms have been seen by many as a cautious stop-gap solution aimed at bolstering a creaking pay-as-you-earn retirement system that is unable to bear the strain of a rapidly greying population Like most other European countries Germany funds retirement benefits by taxing current workers But with people living longer and having fewer children the all-important ratio of workers to dependents is calculated to double over the next 48 years By 2050 there will be two workers for every senior citizen compared with four workers at the moment In such circumstances the level of taxation required to sustain such a system would be unaffordable say pension experts The only solution is to encourage individuals to save for their retirement in individual or group plans by offering subsidies or tax benefits The Riester reforms set out to do just that Starting this year Germans have been able to put up to 4 per cent of their income into state-subsidised retirement schemes either individual Riester products or occupational plans offered by their employer But the financial incentives say critics have not been significant enough It will take more than this to break five decades of reliance on social security says a Frankfurt fund manager Already there is talk of making the schemes compulsory if the voluntary system fails to attract a sufficient number of savers Last week Udo Behrenwaldt head of Deutsche Asset Management's European operation said If behaviour can't be changed then maybe to make the whole system work one would need to make it compulsory  Joachim Faber Allianz's head of fund management has made similar comments This would be politically sensitive But there may be no alternative Recent polls show that more than 70 per cent of Germans are not interested in pension plans Dirk Fach of PwC Consulting says the main problem is that there are lots of rival equity-based products that provide better investment returns A Riester product comes with a money back insurance-style guarantee that by costing more has a negative impact on the returns to the saver But he is optimistic the market will develop A PwC survey of providers shows that most expect corporate or occupational schemes to account for two-thirds of the pension market over time The government estimates that 60m workers could join such company schemes Mr Fach says Providers are beginning to focus on corporate schemes If they can't reach the public directly through Riester products they will try it through employers  Under the pension legislation companies have to offer occupational schemes to employees At present most small- and medium-sized businesses the backbone of the German economy do not offer membership of a company pension scheme The potential is there and the pressure on individuals to save for retirement will only get higher The government is already gradually reducing pension benefits and it is widely expected to cut them further as budgetary difficulties mount Mr Fach says I think people have to get used to the idea of saving for retirement Funded pensions are the only way forward ,3
2002-06-04, Charles Dana Rice senior vice-president and treasurer of El Paso the US natural gas company was found dead on Sunday with a gunshot wound to the head in an apparent suicide El Paso shares lost as much as 25 per cent in morning trading on news of his death Mr Rice 47 a 25-year veteran of El Paso had been suffering from numerous health ailments including heart problems according to people close to the company According to the Harris County medical examiner in Texas a full autopsy has not yet been completed Investors sold El Paso shares on fears of a link between Mr Rice's death and the financial health of the company El Paso has been forced to restructure its borrowings after it emerged that it had kept some debt off the balance sheet using special purpose vehicles similar to those at Enron William Wise El Paso chief executive said Mr Rice's death was a tragic event but he stressed that the market reaction was unwarranted There is no information with respect to the company's performance or credit that was not fully discussed he said Mr Rice's death follows the suicide of J Clifford Baxter the former Enron vice-chairman found dead with a bullet wound to his head in January Mr Baxter who left Enron in May was named in company documents as being opposed to LJM the off-balance sheet partnership set up by Andrew Fastow Enron's former CFO Everyone is going to make the connection between Rice and Baxter said Gordon Howald analyst with Credit Lyonnais Internal people who know him say he's been ill for a while I think it's a little premature to make the connection  El Paso shares had recovered some lost ground by the market close in New York when they were down $3 70 just over 14 per cent at $21 95 ,2
2002-04-18, In a quiet corner of Freiberg in former East Germany at what was the top-secret centre for much of the communist bloc's microelectronics industry Solarworld is investing {XEU}260m $228 8m in one of the world's biggest plants for making solar-energy materials Solarworld a German quoted group bought the solar materials unit two years ago for {XEU}55m from Bayer which in turn had acquired it from a conglomerate following the fall of the Berlin wall The plant in Freiberg near Dresden will produce silicon-based solar cells that transform energy from the sun into electricity Because of the decreasing costs and environmental friendliness many believe solar energy will provide a large part of the world's power needs later this century The expansion in eastern Germany should enable the Bonn-based Solarworld established in 1988 by Frank Asbeck a 42-year-old engineering entrepreneur to compete with much bigger players in solar energy such as oil companies Shell and BP and Japanese electronics giants Kyocera and Sharp We are David and they are the Goliaths says Mr Asbeck Solarworld's chief executive during a whirlwind tour of the Freiberg site But we are as financially strong as our competitors and more flexible  Mr Asbeck adds This industry solar energy is capable of giving us an annual sales growth of 25 per cent in the next few years It's hard to find other sectors of business expanding as fast  Many investors appear to share Mr Asbeck's enthusiasm Since Solarworld's shares were floated in 1999 at {XEU}11 they have outperformed the rest of the Frankfurt stock exchange by 134 per cent Robert Batchelor head of energy technology at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers says Solarworld is in an industry where if you can maintain a good manufacturing base and control costs you have a good chance of delivering some decent margins  Even its rivals seem to agree Jeremy Leggett chief executive of Solar Century a UK solar energy company says Mr Asbeck has created a very attractive investment In 1998 Solarworld with annual sales then of just {XEU}2m was purely a trading company It bought solar-grade silicon wafers and finished solar cells which are produced from wafers from other companies and turned them into solar panels for installing in buildings Then in an effort to become a bigger force in an industry that was making its first real signs of dramatic growth Mr Asbeck decided to move into production on the back of a 60 per cent reduction in solar energy production costs since 1990 The first step was to buy in 1999 a plant in Sweden to make complete solar panels based on groups of cells Mr Asbeck seized control of the Freiberg operation once Bayer decided to sell gaining as part of the deal a 7 4 per cent share in Solarworld This year the Freiberg plant should make 1200 tonnes of solar-grade silicon in the form of wafers enough to produce 80MW of electricity or roughly 20 per cent of this year's estimated output of solar-energy materials Solarworld is investing to increase its wafer production in Freiberg by 150 per cent by 2004 and also to use some of these wafers to make its own cells in large volumes The investment about 30 per cent of which is coming from government funds being used to boost the eastern German economy should increase employment at the Freiberg plant from 240 to 700 By 2004 Mr Asbeck wants Solarworld which last year recorded pre-tax earnings of {XEU}13 1m on sales of {XEU}82m to account for 10 per cent of world solar cell production while maintaining its 20 per cent share in wafers Many in the renewable energy industry applaud Mr Asbeck's audacity at taking such a big step even though they also say that competing in an industry with such big players is risky Christoph Butz an alternative energy specialist at Bank Sarasin the Swiss bank says of Mr Asbeck He has a coherent strategy and he seems determined to push it through ,2
2002-04-20, As sure as day follows night increases in interest rates are going to follow the recent falls After 11 rate cuts in the US last year and four in the eurozone we are now in a trough which has lasted more than four months and could last several more But the next move will be up The historically low levels 1 75 per cent for the US Fed Funds rate and 3 25 per cent for the eurozone's refinancing rate cannot be sustained Eventually they would lead to intolerable inflationary pressures Are Europe's stock markets going to go throw a wobbly once rises resume After all market sentiment has been pretty fragile these last few months exacerbated by Enron Even with the aid of low short-term interest rates and so many signs of improving economies it has been a touch-and-go business pulling out of the slump The bad corporate news continues to emerge Mobile phone maker Nokia shocked the market on Thursday by warning of weaker sales for the rest of the year SAP Europe's biggest software company reported that revenues from software licences were well below consensus The FTSE Eurotop index which measures share prices of Europe's 300 biggest companies stands at about 1260 no higher than it was in early September It first reached that level nearly four years ago So the turn in the interest rate cycle is being anticipated from a defensive position Some might argue the turn has begun Canada raised rates on Tuesday while Sweden and New Zealand moved higher last month But what Europe's bourses are watching for is first of all a US interest rate rise and secondly one at the European Central Bank Alan Greenspan chairman of the US Federal Reserve helped calm market nerves a little this week In his speech to Congress he said inflationary pressures remained low suggesting a rise was not imminent But the previous day's US industrial production and inflation figures both pointed in the other direction bringing closer the day when rates will have to go up Fed funds futures contracts are implying that the first rise could be as soon as June Things are not benign in Europe either The European Union's statistics office confirmed that inflation was beginning to rise again and is now 2 5 per cent compared with the ECB's target ceiling of 2 per cent Rising oil prices have thrown out its calculations that inflation would fall safely below 2 per cent this summer European futures markets imply interest rates of 3 8 per cent by September But past experience suggests we should be sanguine about rate rises The last time we were at this point in the cycle was 1999 The US raised rates in August and in the following six months European equity markets rose more than 17 per cent according to figures from Lehman Brothers In fact in three of the last four cycles markets have moved positively The exception was 1994 when there was a 12 per cent fall Analysts at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney say the Fed which started raising rates in June was perceived as being behind the curve trying but failing to catch up with inflation In consequence equities and bonds sold off on rising inflationary fears What does the market perceive this time Looking at yield curves for government bonds SSSB concludes the market is not flustered We do not expect to see big increases in bond yields unlike 1994 Inflation expectations should be kept well under control  Ed Teather economist at UBS Warburg says the way the market receives rate rises will depend on the timing If they go up soon they may well undermine confidence and lead to bankruptcies But he disagrees with what futures markets are suggesting and expects no Fed rise until late in the year and no ECB rise before early next year so long as oil prices don't shoot up By then he believes rate rises will be seen in a more positive light as a ratification of recovery Ian Scott at Lehman Brothers believes rate rises will not be traumatic for the markets Although some bad results are still coming through he says the overall environment is now pretty good with more upgrades than downgrades to earnings estimates The trick now is to judge when to start selling cyclical sectors which start to underperform as interest rates rise Most analysts suggest it is still too early ,2
2002-06-06, No one believed he really meant it When Jose Maria Aznar was re-elected in 2000 he said he would not seek a third term in office Before the Popular party congress in January Mr Aznar's supporters including many cabinet ministers urged him to reconsider He didn't Mr Aznar told the assembled party faithful he would retire from domestic politics when his term ends in 2004 The 49-year-old prime minister said eight years in power were enough In addition to stepping down as premier Mr Aznar will also quit the presidency of the political party he has led for 12 years His decision has confounded supporters who cannot understand why a politician should want to exit the stage at the peak of his powers with no serious rivals in or outside government and at such a relatively youthful age But in many ways it is a typical Aznar decision taken on his own without consulting colleagues think tanks or opinion polls Even when he is being adored by ecstatic fans Mr Aznar appears stiff and embarrassed a lonely figure in spite of his electoral success Cabinet ministers often say they do not know what goes on in the prime minister's mind They would never dare second-guess him That is why no knows what Mr Aznar plans to do with the rest of his life less still who he will nominate to succeed him Mr Aznar's decision to quit on a winning streak stems in part from observing the decline of his Socialist predecessor After governing Spain for 14 years Felipe Gonzalez's truncated fourth term was marred by infighting and corruption scandals Even without this cautionary tale Mr Aznar gives the impression that he has applied his pragmatic approach to politics with its emphasis on finite achievable goals to the optimal longevity of political careers By the time he leaves office at the age of 51 Spain will have an established track record of balanced budgets job creation relatively low inflation and above average EU growth Legal frameworks will be in place to encourage competition in telecommunications gas and electricity markets although getting Spanish companies to shed their clubbiness requires tougher regulators and a radical shakeup of corporate habits Mr Aznar has been less successful on the ideological front His belief in the unity of Spain has been championed by the Spanish right under the new banner of constitutional patriotism The attempt to drum up pride in being Spanish however has not been an effective antidote to the rise of regional nationalist movements in the Basque country Catalonia and Galicia Mr Aznar's government regards ETA the armed Basque separatist group as terrorists and rejects a negotiated solution to the conflict More controversially his government seeks to outlaw political groups which share ETA's goal Basque independence even when they do not share ETA's violent methods Parliament is debating a new law to ban groups that excuse or justify terrorism It is aimed at Batasuna a party that polled 10 per cent of the vote in the Basque country last year Given the disarray within the Socialists most Spaniards take it for granted that the next prime minister will be handpicked by Mr Aznar True to form Mr Aznar has not given even the slightest hint of whom he has in mind as successor The uncertainty encourages potential dauphins to remain on best behaviour and it also protects Mr Aznar from turning himself into a lame duck two years before the end of his term Even if the next prime minister comes from the Popular party it is not clear whether he or she would pursue Mr Aznar's liberal economic policies with equal vigour Few die-hard liberals exist within the Spanish right most politicians favour the French or German model of corporate capitalism where banks are entwined in the lives of companies as shareholders as well as financiers Of the contenders Rodrigo Rato economy minister is the most frequently named He is the most seasoned politician in Mr Aznar's cabinet but at the age of 53 many insiders believe he will be forced to retire with Mr Aznar Mr Rato has been criticised for cronyism in appointing friends as chairmen of privatised companies where government retains golden shares Mr Rato says he has done these companies no favours and points to legislation that has opened energy and telecoms markets as proof that he has been tough and fair But the charge will be difficult to shrug off Mariano Rajoy interior minister shares Mr Rato's sharp wit but little else He is being touted as a contender since taking over government's toughest and most public portfolio last year Mr Rajoy is at the forefront of the government's war against ETA and he is also in charge of immigration policy which many Spaniards believe is the most important social issue Jaime Mayor Oreja Mr Rajoy's predecessor at the interior ministry is also touted as a candidate Mr Mayor Oreja quit his cabinet post to lead the Popular party's bid to unseat Basque nationalists in last year's regional elections He lost but was widely considered to have put up a heroic fight Mr Mayor Oreja scores high points on integrity but fewer on energy and ambition Mr Aznar could of course surprise everyone by naming a relative newcomer to politics such as Angel Acebes Spain's 43-year-old justice minister Whoever Mr Aznar has in mind the guessing game will continue for at least another year ,3
2002-06-04, The departure of Alistair Darling to the Department of Transport may have plugged a vital gap in Tony Blair's Cabinet but it represents distinctly unfortunate timing for the pensions industry In about a month Alan Pickering is due to present his report to the Department of Work and Pensions on the simplification of the UK pensions regime At about the same time Ron Sandler will produce his review commissioned by the Treasury of the long-term savings industry he and Pickering have been keeping in touch Then there is an Inland Revenue review of pensions taxation and the recently launched review of the performance of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority Most of these reviews will now be considered by a new man Andrew Smith Not only will he have to bed himself into issues with which he is likely to be unfamiliar it is also hard for any man to be fully committed to implementing studies commissioned by his predecessor We can only hope that Mr Smith has an open mind for there can be little doubt that the pensions industry faces a crisis Some would claim that the switch from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes is merely a natural evolution reflecting the development of a more flexible workforce pursuing portfolio careers But companies are not switching schemes in response to a changing workforce they are changing schemes to cut costs Research shows that employers almost halve their contributions when they abandon a defined benefit scheme From the employee's point of view a defined contribution scheme represents greater risks and lower benefits that is not a good deal There is a limit of course to how much the government can do about this Future investment returns will inevitably be low in an era of low inflation the longevity of the population is steadily increasing Both developments make pensions much more costly to fund The FRS 17 accounting standard which is encouraging many companies to abandon defined benefit pensions was introduced by an independent body and it would be wrong for the government to interfere But the government has not helped the industry most notably with the abolition of the dividend tax credit And the burden of regulation on pension schemes has been far too heavy Darling appeared to have grasped part of the problem If the burden of pension provision is to be transferred from the state and the employer to the citizen then regulations must be reduced products must be made simpler and charges must be kept under control Stakeholder pensions were a step down this path and the Pickering review promises to take it further But further change is needed The recent review of the annuities market was disappointing more flexibility is needed if Britons are to be persuaded that saving for a pension is worthwhile The government's new second state pension is ludicrously complicated and the national insurance rebates offered are too small Add in the pensions credit which will top up the income of the lower paid and large numbers of people have a big incentive to rely on the state for provision that is against the government's stated aim One area where Darling proved reluctant to budge was the retirement age One can understand his point the UK is still in the process of equalising the retirement age of men and women and so any change to the overall age could not be phased in until 2020 Furthermore a large part of the workforce already retires well before the existing limit of 65 But increasing longevity means the official retirement age of 65 makes little economic sense We are all going to have to work longer to enjoy anything like a prosperous retirement over to you Mr Smith ,3
1998-04-01, UKRAINIAN ELECTIONS OSCE criticises poll campaign The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe has sharply criticised Ukraine's parliamentary and local elections which were held on Sunday The OSCE said the pre-election campaigns were marred by incidents of violence arrests and actions against candidates and abuse of public office that repre sent serious shortcomings in the conduct of the campaign and raise questions about the neutrality of the state apparatus in the election The OSCE report concentrated on violations in local elections but also pointed out many attempts by the Ukrainian government to manipulate the national media With 180 out of 225 districts reporting parliamentary election results yesterday the Communist party looked set to win over a quarter of the 450 seats in parlia ment Its Socialist allies have strengthened since Monday's pre liminary figures and could take 20 to 40 seats Two other parties which previously looked to have grabbed over 4 per cent of the vote entitling them to seats in parliament have now fallen back below this mark at least temporarily These are the pro-government Agrarian party and the opposition Hro mada Community party ,3

1998-04-03, OLYMPIC AIRWAYS Unions spread strikes Greece's confederation of trade unions organised a three-hour work stoppage at utilities and state enterprises yesterday in support of workers at Olympic Airways who are contesting the Socialist government's rescue plan The government faces the prospect of wider unrest in the public sector if the crisis over the loss-making state carrier is prolonged Costas Simitis the prime minister agreed last month to implement sweeping reforms at utilities and state-controlled corporations as the price of the drachma's entry to Europe's exchange rate mechanism Mr Simitis appears to have rallied the cabinet behind him but he faces opposition from a group of leftwing deputies in his party who have submitted written objections to the transport ministry's restructuring plan for the airline The work stoppage timed to coincide with the evening rush hour shut down state-owned broadcasting services and public transport in Athens The state electricity utility struggling to repair transmission systems wrecked last week by storms and high winds warned of possible power cuts ,3
2002-06-27, The downfall of one hyper-ambitious acquisitive telecommunications company inevitably cast a pall over another yesterday Vodafone shares which hit a peak of 399p at the height of the telecoms boom tumbled almost 5 per cent to close at 86{1/2}p Shareholders said WorldCom's latest revelations were leading them to question the accounting policies of other telecoms operators Investors will need to be reassured that everything is all right said Jim Stride at Axa Investment Managers However while there are concerns about Vodafone's complex accounting practices shareholders and analysts said these were different to those raised by WorldCom WorldCom's admission that it booked certain operating costs as capital expenditure was seen as a blatant attempt by the company to inflate its earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda WorldCom was able to spread this cost over a number of years and hence flatter its ebitda Booking some operating expenses such as one-off employee costs as capital expenditure is deemed legitimate practice for telecoms operators while they invest heavily in new infrastructure such as the roll out of broadband services or third generation networks But the latest revelations at WorldCom show that it booked $3 8bn £2 6bn of operating costs as capital expenditure So operating costs accounted for 39 per cent of WorldCom's capex compared to less controversial figures of about 15 per cent for BT Group and Cable and Wireless and just 5 per cent for Vodafone Across European incumbents Goldman Sachs estimates operating costs such as one-off labour costs account for about 10 per cent of capex Analysts said these lower figures indicated that European operators were not deliberately seeking to inflate their ebitda figures However they said it would not stop much closer scrutiny of telecoms accounting practices To me the issue is not so much whether other European operators are capitalising costs in the same way as WorldCom it is the interpretation of accounting policies in telecoms generally said Chris Godsmark at Investec Securities While analysts insisted there were no signs that Vodafone had sought to flatter its profits in the same way as WorldCom some criticised the group's heavy focus on ebitda as a performance benchmark Questions also surround Vodafone's use of proportionate ebitda whereby the mobile operator includes earnings from operations where it only holds minority stakes Some investors said the latest developments were also likely to lead to much closer scrutiny of executive incentive packages which in some cases are ebitda based There are also lingering questions about Vodafone's accounting treatment of goodwill particularly whether further write-offs are needed in light of depressed sector valuations It has £94bn of goodwill on its books as well as £14bn for 3G licences But most analysts say the focus for investor concern on Vodafone was not so much its accounting but its business outlook Some of the more bullish analysts argue Vodafone could benefit from reduced competition They added that Vodafone remained in a fundamentally better financial position than many of its stricken peers after paying for acquisitions in paper This has given it a stronger balance sheet highlighted by a debt to equity ratio of 9 per cent one of the lowest in the sector Tim Rees director of investment strategy at Clerical Medical Investment Group and a long-time bear of Vodafone said he had recently bought the stock after long avoiding it The valuations have come down to a more sensible range in the last couple of months ,2
2002-04-18, Former guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao yesterday won a landslide victory in elections for the presidency of the world's newest nation East Timor United Nations election officials said Jose Alexandre Xanana Gusmao had won 82 7 per cent of 378538 votes cast His rival Francisco Xavier do Amaral won 17 3 per cent The United Nations after ruling for more than two years will formally hand power to the 55-year-old Mr Gusmao a former nationalist poet and an elected assembly on May 20 Although the East Timor constitution prescribes a largely ceremonial role for the president Mr Gusmao is likely to remain a powerful figure The UN has often consulted him on important decisions and Mari Alkatiri the prime minister who has more formal powers than Mr Gusmao lacks his grassroots popularity East Timor's UN governor Sergio Vieira de Mello congratulated Mr Gusmao on his victory I trust Mr Gusmao will devote his infinite energy and will to fulfilling the noble pledges he made he said Mr Gusmao and East Timor's other leaders now face the challenge of building a nation on a barren island where some 80 per cent of its 740000 people are near-subsistence farmers East Timor has been scarred not only by Indonesia's brutal 24-year occupation but also by a short civil war in 1974 after the territory's previous rulers the Portuguese fled their former colony Now another split is appearing between a tiny Portuguese-speaking elite in Dili the capital and a generation that grew up speaking Indonesian The next five years will be an enormous challenge Mr Gusmao said The expectations are high the anxieties and necessities enormous  Mr Gusmao educated in Portuguese in a Jesuit seminary favours reconciliation between East Timorese His popularity stems from his 24-year career as a guerrilla leader and symbol of East Timor's resistance After Indonesia's invasion in 1975 Mr Gusmao fled to the hills to lead rebels often armed only with bows and arrows He evaded capture until 1992 Mr Gusmao then became Indonesia's most famous political prisoner receiving the likes of South African president Nelson Mandela in his Jakarta prison cell For seven years he continued the struggle befriending guards and smuggling letters to comrades and journalists But when Mr Gusmao returned to Dili in October 1999 he found the territory in ruins After East Timor's vote for independence in a UN-supervised poll in August Indonesian soldiers set fire to towns and villages Militia gangs drove some 600000 people from their homes and left more than 1000 dead ,3
2002-06-13, Policymakers at the Federal Reserve rarely come out and say explicitly what they want or what they plan to do But they have repeatedly suggested over the past few weeks that they would like stronger evidence of sustainable self-reinforcing economic growth in the US before they raise short-term interest rates from the 40-year lows set amid last year's recession Specifically they have implied that they want more signs that unemployment has peaked that business confidence is recovering and that profits and investment are approaching normal levels Robert McTeer a top Federal Reserve official recently said the US economy's recovery from last year's recession was on track but that it was not rapid or strong enough to provide much lift to the job market that corporate profits needed to improve and that the stock market's sharp drop toward post-September 11 lows in recent weeks threatened to damp consumers' spirits and their spending Speculators have become increasingly convinced by such remarks and by recent economic reports and anecdotes that the US economy has not met the wish list of Mr McTeer or the rest of the Fed and might not until 2003 They got some more encouragement from the Fed yesterday The central bank's latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions a hodgepodge of anecdotes from regional Fed offices across the country released yesterday described the US economy as a mixed bag through late April and May It characterised economic growth as modest and uneven with some sectors showing signs of improvement while others softened or remained weak It marked a retreat from the previous Beige Book appraisal which called the economy's overall tone in March unambiguously positive extolling improvement in all but one of the Fed's 12 regional districts It said service industries posted modest growth housing remained robust and manufacturing activity was higher in most districts in April and May But it said labour markets were generally slack retail sales mixed sluggish or flat and commercial real estate weak with vacancy rates high and rental rates still falling Manufacturing activity though improved remained uneven and demand for business loans was generally weak It emboldened speculators to further cut the odds of any monetary tightening this year Interest-rate futures which have been falling for months took another step down after the report's release The new Beige Book was released amid renewed disappointment over the pace of America's economic recovery from the investment fiasco of the past few years and the recession of the past year That disappointment has been coupled with uncertainty on how the economy will weather the current crisis of investor confidence Historically the Fed waits several months to confirm a post-recession peak in unemployment before raising short-term rates With businesses still reluctant to spend money on new equipment and new employees their sales growth uncertain their profit margins under pressure and stock prices under attack the number of unemployed Americans continues to rise Market measures of inflation expectations have been falling and the beige book did note yesterday that price pressures were in check giving financial markets further encouragement that the Fed will not raise interest rates soon But the Beige Book did note rising costs for steel energy and insurance Meanwhile some economists worry that the weakening of the US dollar and dip in the stock market raise the threat of aprolonged investment slump higher inflation rising interest rates and a pronounced slowdown in consumer spending That economic and political uncertainty facing the US central bank is clearly evident in US stock prices unusually volatile over the past few weeks and again yesterday ,3

2002-04-24, Close Brothers among the last remaining independent UK investment banks is looking for bolt-on acquisitions after raising £55m from a share placing with Scottish Widows Investment Partnership However some small shareholders are unhappy with the placing Peter Winkworth finance director said the bank would focus on expanding its core asset management and banking businesses notably in the areas of offshore wealth management and private client work We're always interested in businesses with good margins and they are not easy to find in asset management said Mr Winkworth adding that any deals were not going to be glitzy The bank's last acquisition in August was a Jersey-based private client business the last of nine acquisitions over 14 months which Mr Winkworth said had cost more than the fresh funds raised yesterday Close Brothers' balance sheet is already one of the strongest in the sector and the issue of 6 8m new shares gives Scottish Widows a 4 97 per cent stake making it the bank's third-largest shareholder after Caledonia Investments and Prudential Some shareholders said the bank should have opted for Scottish Widows to buy shares in the market rather than make a dilutive issue for which it has no specific corporate purpose Mr Winkworth defended the issue which he said had been approved at its annual meeting and brought a shareholder on board that added to the bank's respectability Analysts said that Scottish Widows was buying into company-specific upside rather than signalling an improvement in investor sentiment in the broader brokerage sector Close Brothers shares closed down 10p at 795p ,1

2002-04-15, It was only by accident that Vadim Moshkovich a software engineer-turned-businessman went into farming He met by chance a senior executive of Red October Moscow's biggest confectionery plant The man complained that the company could make far more of its best-selling chocolate bars if only it could secure more high-grade sugar Mr Moshkovich answered that he had contacts and might be able to help In fact he knew little about the sugar industry except that the best sugar came from the black earth lands of the Volga basin of Russia and eastern Ukraine He borrowed a truck drove to Ukraine and returned with a load of sugar which met Red October's quality standards That was seven years ago Today he runs Rusagro an agricultural and food processing business with 15000 employees and an annual turnover of $500m I took advantage of a good opportunity says 35-year-old Mr Moshkovich Rusagro's chief executive and controlling shareholder He works from a modest office at the back of a Moscow block On the walls are maps of the Volga basin and a large photograph of a ceremonial meeting between the presidents of the three Slav states to emerge from the Soviet Union Russia Ukraine and Belarus Mr Moshkovich says the region has a great future as an agricultural producer and he wants to play his part Our strategy is to expand to restructure and to boost the capital in our business he says The group runs eight sugar mills in southern Russia which produce about 15 per cent of the company's requirements The rest is imported cane sugar The plan is to increase the locally-produced share to 50 per cent Rusagro also sells 200000 tonnes of sunflower oil a year and 100000 tonnes of grain It plans to expand both businesses rapidly The group has acquired control of 100000 hectares of land and wants to secure more Today this is held through leases and agreements with local authorities But a new land code currently before the Russian parliament would allow the company to start buying land outright from peasants and other owners Mr Moshkovich says it is a good law which will help the development of Russian agriculture by permitting the use of land as capital Mr Moshkovich is concerned about the possible impact of accession to the World Trade Organisation WTO Russia must not lose its competitive advantages through membership The main thing is that it should not be the subject of double standards If others pay subsidies to farmers then Russia should too If they have tariffs then we should too  Mr Moshkovich argues that Russia should not rush into the WTO without a fully developed policy which he says could take several years to implement Everything depends on securing the right conditions My view is that if the government makes decisions in the best interests of the nation Russia will return to world markets as one of the major exporters It could take three to five years  Mr Moshkovich's forecast sounds optimistic given the poor state of much of Russian agriculture which was twisted into uncompetitive structures by communism and has since suffered mainly decay and neglect But Rusagro is producing results Visitors to its farms praise their high standards well-managed appearance and new equipment Mr Moshkovich says that with thousands of companies now active in agriculture the sector can change We just need the right policy from the government Everything comes from the top in Russia he says Stefan Wagstyl,2
2002-06-15, Fears about the financial health of the insurance industry helped drive the FTSE 100 index down to its lowest level since September 24 After a brutal week for equity trading investors expressed concerns that UK insurers were being forced to sell equities and buy bonds in order to meet regulatory solvency requirements There was talk today of solvency trades going through both here and in Europe said Keith Skeoch chief investment officer of Standard Life Investments Insurers are obliged to maintain minimum solvency margins in their funds This is subject to a resilience test which measures the ability of a fund to withstand significant falls in asset prices such as equities and fixed-interest securities The Financial Services Authority twice relaxed its resilience test last year following concerns that insurers would be forced sellers of shares in order to bolster their financial position The first relaxation was announced a few hours before the attacks on the World Trade Center when the FTSE 100 stood at 5034 The FTSE 100 fell 141 1 to 4630 8 yesterday having been down 206 5 at 4565 4 at one stage off 6 per cent on the week The Techmark 100 index fell to a new low of 881 11 Banks and telecommunications shares suffered again with HSBC finishing down 3 per cent and Royal Bank of Scotland 2 7 per cent lower Vodafone fell 3 7 per cent to close at 91p The selling in the UK market was matched in overseas markets with the US S&P 500 dropping below 1000 in early trading for the first time since the aftermath of last year's terrorist attacks The FSA said after September 11 that several UK life assurers were trading close to their regulatory solvency margin But the regulator emphasised these margins were set high and therefore did not mean any companies were close to commercial insolvency The FSA is unlikely to relax its resilience test despite the FTSE 100 having dropped below 5000 as previous changes were more concerned with addressing market turbulence rather than the absolute level of share prices Analysts said US hedge funds were aggressively shorting life assurance shares selling shares they do not own in anticipation of being able to buy them back more cheaply Elsewhere investor sentiment continued to be depressed by worries about the US economy the strength of corporate earnings and after a car bomb outside the US consulate in Karachi Pakistan the threat of global terrorism In Germany the technology-heavy Nemax All-share dropped to its lowest-ever level while the DAX finished down 3 7 per cent In Paris the CAC 40 closed down 2 9 per cent to 3843 07 its lowest level since September 21 As equities fell investors looked hard for alternatives The 10 year Treasury bond gained three-quarters of a point with the yield dropping to 4 8 per cent its lowest of the year while gold briefly surged above $322 an ounce in early trading The US economic worries helped the euro climb to another 17-month high against the dollar of $0 9523 while the pound reached an eight-month high of $1 4799 ,1
2002-06-12, Rolf Breuer the outgoing chairman of Deutsche Bank did not mince his words at this year's annual meeting Last year had been an annus horribilis for Germany's banks The global downturn had exposed the fragility of the German financial sector its past failure to tackle structural weaknesses and its inability to cut gross overcapacity in the market While Deutsche unlike its domestic rivals had established a global presence it still faced big challenges in securing its long-term future Its top priority was now to make itself fit for future challenges by cutting its bloated cost base and boosting its low profitability Deutsche Mr Breuer insisted would have to reinvent itself That task now falls to his successor Josef Ackermann the 54-year-old Swiss national who has taken over the helm of the bank Mr Ackermann a former top executive at Credit Suisse joined Deutsche in 1996 after losing a power struggle at the Swiss bank In 1998 he was appointed head of investment banking where he took credit for turning what was a chaotic collection of businesses into a global investment banking powerhouse that now contributes more than 70 per cent of total group earnings The place was in disarray when he arrived He cleared the whole thing up says one of Deutsche's investment bankers His success during the past four years has allowed him to nurture a power base in London and New York home to most of Deutsche's 11000 investment bankers It has also created a powerful force for change within the bank In the past the old guard who wanted to stick to the German way of doing things tried to sabotage the investment banking business recalls a senior executive They did not like what they thought was a foreign adventure They wanted Deutsche to remain a commercial lender and retail bank  But aided and abetted by other modernisers at the bank such as Mr Breuer Deutsche's investment bankers have used their money-making power to wrest control of Germany's biggest bank from the traditionalists The struggle has been difficult and at times painful Mr Breuer suffered the embarrassment of seeing his planned merger with arch rival Dresdner Bank collapse in 2000 after Deutsche's investment bankers threatened to sell Dresdner's investment bank rather than integrate it Amid bitter recriminations Deutsche moved quickly to appoint Mr Ackermann as chairman-designate almost two years ahead of Mr Breuer's retirement date in effect ensuring the ascendancy of the group's Wall Street-trained investment bankers For much of the past two years Mr Ackermann has kept a diplomatically low profile But bolstered by his investment banking troops the former Swiss army officer has started to plot what will be a painful and controversial reinvention of Deutsche as a new style universal bank Earlier this year he pushed through a radical restructuring of management that creates a powerful new 12-man executive committee responsible for day-to-day operations and strategy Mr Ackermann will chair it in effect securing US-style chief executive powers with undisputed control over the fortunes of the bank a clear break with the German tradition of consensus management Insiders say it offers the best chance of providing the decisive leadership that the markets clients and international investors have been looking for Some German bankers were not so happy to see the shift of power Thomas Fischer chief risk officer and a one-time contender for the top job resigned in January in protest at the changes claiming they heralded a move of Deutsche Bank's headquarters from Frankfurt to London Mr Ackermann has also unveiled a flurry of measures aimed at supporting its sagging share price and making it fit for the challenges ahead Dubbed operation share price executives say the measures aim to double Deutsche's market capitalisation and put it among the leading five banks in the world To achieve that Mr Ackermann plans to redeploy the bank's capital reallocating it to the businesses that generate the best returns investment banking and wealth management Low profit and loss-making businesses will be sold Deutsche is in the process of selling its lossmaking French retail banking business and is looking for strategic alternatives for its passive asset management and global custody businesses Further capital will be released by winding down lending to small and medium-sized companies which have been hard hit by the downturn in Germany Meanwhile Deutsche's retail banking business in Europe is set for a wide ranging overhaul in a bid to increase profitability focusing more on financial and banking services for the rich Mr Ackermann also wants to cut costs by {XEU}2bn by 2003 Deutsche is already shedding about 10 per cent of its workforce although further head-count reductions are thought likely Finally Mr Ackermann wants to accelerate the sale of Deutsche's {XEU}15bn portfolio of industrial holdings earmarking some of the proceeds for a share buy-back programme If he can deliver then Deutsche's sagging share price should respond Credit Suisse First Boston analysts say the stock could be worth up to {XEU}90 if all restructuring targets are met That would begin to bring Mr Ackermann some of the strategic flexibility he is looking for Tony Major,2
1998-04-03, National Savings yesterday shortlisted two bidders for its back-office operations and gave a strong indication that its 4000 staff will be transferred from the civil service to the private sector The unions which represent most of the workforce condemned the move as privatisation by any other name EDS and Siemens Business Services were shortlisted from the four bidders who hoped to run the government agency's systems National Savings offers savings accounts to the public to raise money towards the national debt It had previously insisted it was neutral between transferring staff to the private sector or retaining civil servants but involving private companies in providing computer systems It said it had not decided for certain to involve the public sector or whether there would be any transfers of staff However Peter Bareau chief executive said A public/private partnership for the delivery of services potentially offers opportunity to all  He indicated that staff were facing a transfer to the private sector by bringing up the European directive on transfers He said workers had the prospect of improved job security along with the assurance that existing terms and conditions of employment are protected National Savings will not give up control over the setting of interest rates or of product design It said it needed to modernise and equip itself for the future The move provoked anger among the unions representing staff Chris Sandilands who represents National Savings at the Glasgow branch of the Public Services Tax and Commerce union said any transfer of staff was as good as privatisation She added We feel the public sector can do everything that is needed to modernise National Savings without going down the road of privatisation  The failed bidders were ICL and Equip a consortium led by Capita but including AT&T and Bull ,1
1998-04-01, Darryl Mattocks founder and managing director of Internet Bookshop has resigned after a boardroom row over the future of the Ofex-quoted company The company one of the UK's larger specialist online retailers is expected to announce his departure today However Mr Mattocks confirmed yesterday that he had resigned after a stormy board meeting on Monday I've put a lot of blood sweat and tears into building up this company he said But I couldn't agree with the majority of the other directors on future strategy  Mr Mattocks a 33 year-old former information technology consultant founded Internet Bookshop in Oxford five years ago Early last year the company raised £1m from an Ofex flotation to finance its future expansion Internet Bookshop reported a pre-tax loss of £116000 on turnover of £803000 in the six months to June 30 its last published results Sales are understood to have continued to increase during the second half despite growing competition from Amazon and other US-based internet book stores and the launch of online subsidiaries by traditional UK bookshops including Waterstone's and Dillons Amazon is now considering plans to open local distribution centres in Europe The online arm of Barnes & Noble one of the biggest US book chains may follow suit in the longer term Internet Bookshop has found a joint venture partner in Italy to set up a distribution operation there and Mr Mattocks was keen to establish distribution ventures in other European countries I wanted us to become the Amazon of Europe he said Mr Mattocks said other board members had opposed his plans and favoured a more cautious approach to expansion even though informal approaches had suggested that Internet Bookshop could secure the necessary investment He said that a row broke out at Monday's board meeting when he proposed seeking a Nasdaq quotation internet Bookshop was not available to comment on Mr Mattocks' departure ,2
2002-06-26, The private equity consortium trying to buy Energis the debt-laden telecommunications operator that has put itself up for sale has lowered its offer by about 30 per cent since it has become the only bidder The financial buyers which include Apax Partners Carlyle Group Permira and Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm are now offering Energis's creditors between £400m and £500m for the company An earlier indicative offer would have covered the face value of Energis's outstanding bank debt of £690m This month the firms teamed up to make a joint offer The banks however could decide to recapitalise the business themselves if they determine the private equity offer is too low That is what the creditors of NTL the UK cable operator did after rejecting an offer from John Malone's Liberty Media group because they decided it was not high enough Without what they consider a credible offer the creditors would probably hold on to the business until the market improves at which time another telecoms company could emerge as a trade buyer ,2
2002-06-21, These are strange times in the world of private equity The buy-out sector is pregnant with cash but the extent of investment opportunities in remains unclear A deal bonanza was expected to bear fruit at the end of last year This was based on the theory that the economic slowing would force cash- strapped companies to make disposals en masse that would be mopped up by private equity buyers Yet it has failed to materialise with the first quarter of 2002 pretty dismal in terms of deal flow John Singer managing director Advent International says I find this a very weird downturn Consumers are still spending and interest rates are low So there is not the same pressure to dispose of assets at prices that reflect the economic circumstances  However those deals that appear attractive are commanding high prices One example of tough competition for a plum deal was the purchase of National Car Parks In one of the fiercest auctions for years Cinven the large leveraged buy-out firm paid £820m to snatch NCP a disposal by Cendant of US from under the nose of Apax with BC Partners apparently making a last minute re-entry into the fray The financing structure under which Royal Bank of Scotland took the assets on to its books until regulatory clearance is secured from Brussels helped clinch the deal But inevitably Cinven which has just raised a private equity fund of {XEU}4 3bn the fourth in Europe to exceed {XEU}4bn was accused of having paid excessively Sir Ronald Cohen chairman of Apax now investing a {XEU}4 4bn fund says Businesses that are easy to value are attracting huge competition NCP was more difficult to value and we hoped there would be less competition but what attracted everyone was the very steady cashflow  There are no prizes however simply for winning lots of deals he says With the substantial economic and political risks we all face those paying high prices will regret it bitterly in two years  Thomas Krenz managing director of Permira in Ger many describes the deal pipeline as weaker than I expected It is similar to last year when lots of people were disappointed There have been fewer fire sales  Matters have been further complicated in Germany where on the fiscal front the picture has turned sour within a matter of months The industry has had to lobby heavily to head off proposals to tax private equity funds at the full corporate rate Meanwhile it seems likely that private equity partners' profits will be taxed as income rather than capital gains which threatens a mass exodus of executives from Germany But there are bright spots Andrew Hawkins partner at Palamon which is investing at the smaller end of the market has already seen a pick-up in activity You can buy really decent stable businesses at below one times sales and low single figures of ebit earnings before interest and tax which was unheard of in 2000  Meanwhile the putative attractions of the mid-market enabled Bridgepoint Capital to close its latest fund at {XEU}2bn substantially ahead of its target And at the larger end the US buy-out houses appear suddenly and unexpectedly bullish After a forlorn 2001 and early 2002 they detect a clear pick-up in deal flow within the past eight weeks in the US which they say will be reflected in deals completed in the third quarter Some see signs that Europe is following I don't know whether it is a blip or the fact that the cocktail of plenty of equity debt markets coming back and vendors becoming realistic about price expectations is beginning to gel said one industry specialist The unnerving effect of scandals across corporate America has not paralysed activity Larry Schloss CSFB's global head of private equity argues People don't feel cheery but there comes a time when you just have got to go and do stuff It has picked up dramatically in Europe and the US It is scattered it is random but it is happening  Stephen Schwarzman head of The Blackstone Group agrees that a flurry of transactions appear to be happening Corporations want to become more conservative so they are making disposals to pay down debt and reduce their reliance on the banks  Perhaps the biggest preoccupation though for the industry not to mention investors remains exits The mergers and acquisitions market is still comatose so it is no surprise that when the first chink of light appeared this year suggesting a reopening of the new issues market there was a stampede from the direction of private equity portfolios How many of these will get away is not clear particularly as public market investors have become increasingly cynical about providing a get-out-of-jail card for private equity firms Michel Guillet at BC Partners in Paris thinks the market has to get used to the idea that our industry is always going to be a major provider of IPOs We are agents of change It is a bizarre thing for people to start to differentiate deals by source  At the same time the industry needs to be more creative and develop a range of solutions that may be less at the mercy of the vagaries of the stock market suggests Oliver Tant head of private equity at KPMG Doing deals is still seen as the sexy stuff says Charles Martin of lawyers Macfarlanes But exiting well is the clever thing  Concerns about problem children in the portfolio by contrast seem to have abated at least for the moment There have been a few high profile disasters such as the collapse of Fairchild Dornier the German/ US regional jet manufacturer and there are a handful of deals known to be troubled But as one US investor puts it We are pleasantly surprised as to how the returns of European buy-outs have held up  The same cannot be said of the venture industry While executives frequently stress that the region did not indulge quite as deeply in the excesses seen in the US the industry is also much less experienced and hence more fragile and vulnerable to a pretty brutal a shake-out The silver lining is that unlike in the buy-out world valuations have clearly plummeted Sir David Cooksey chairman of Advent Venture Partners says his firm is actively investing at unbelievable prices Chris Grew partner at lawyers Brobeck Hale & Dorr adds VCs have been telling their limited partners investors that it is the right time to invest because valuations are low Now they have to back up the words with action  The trick says Philippe Herbert partner at Partech is to find the pockets where IT spending is holding up and there are some The exit scenario however remains glum We have half a dozen companies in the portfolio ready to IPO with no prospects of doing so which gets quite frustrating says Sir David The industry certainly has some work to do in repairing its image according to Max Burger-Calderon this year's chairman of the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association We have to prove we are not in the fashion business  And all venture firms continue to bemoan the lack of a functioning pan-European stock market for high-growth companies In the long term however the conditions for the European private equity industry at large are set fair as regards investor appetite according to Apax In a study for its 30th anniversary the firm predicts public and private pension funds in Europe will double their allocations to private equity to about 7 per cent over the next 10 years Returns will be dramatically lower industry executives acknowledge but with stock markets moving sideways the goal shifts to achieving relative outperformance The challenge is to adjust the investment model in a sufficiently creative manner particularly as regards exits to achieve that outperformance ,1
2002-06-04, It is not hard to find evidence of a rising tide of shareholder activism in the UK From shooting down a controversial pay package at insurer Prudential to pushing hotelier Six Continents to declare its hand on the use of its cash pile shareholders are displaying a new resolution to weigh in on corporate issues But for the government it is not enough It wants more activism and is preparing legislation to compel investors to intervene The move has raised alarm in the City Industry bodies fear legislation leading to a US-style litigious culture where legal compliance takes precedence over genuine activism A new industry code on the responsibilities of large investors to act has been offered as alternative to legislation The government has hinted it may prepared to consider this But either way it seems the pressure on investors to become more interventionist will intensify In the old City culture most investors were largely disengaged from the companies they owned preferring to sell a problem rather than address it Warren Buffett the US investor with guru status has described this as the gin rummy approach to investing discard your least promising business at each turn If that was not possible and things became very bad a quiet word might be had in the discreet confines of a club or boardroom Such approaches were sharply criticised last year in Paul Myners' influential review of institutional investment It was this report by the former head of Gartmore the fund manager that prompted the government's legislative move Mr Myners described as a poacher turned gamekeeper by some in the industry blamed the reluctance of fund managers to intervene for the loss of value on some investments There is a culture in the financial community of wanting to avoid public confrontation with companies not wanting to be seen to have lost confidence in them or their management he said In line with his recommendations the government is planning to impose a statutory duty on all those involved in investing pension funds to use their rights and powers in the best interests of the members and beneficiaries of such a scheme They would be expected to intervene where there was a reasonable chance of enhancing the value of an investment The UK law would be modelled on US legislation called Employment Retirement Income Security Act 1974 or Erisa While the wording of the proposed legislation appears benign it has been criticised by industry It would be a recipe for litigation according to Richard Saunders head of the Investment Management Association the UK trade body Failure to comply could leave fund managers and pension fund trustees subject to civil claims for damages if they were found to have missed signs of bankruptcy such as at Enron I would question whether it is right to impose such a general and open-ended duty by law says Mr Saunders Others fear it will lead to a box-ticking approach to corporate governance where investors would focus on meeting minimum legal requirements Hermes Pensions Management one of the country's strongest campaigners on corporate governance says it will have the unintended consequence of creating activity without action The US model has also been seen as an inappropriate benchmark that could weaken UK corporate governance standards Critics say Erisa has been widely interpreted in the US as simply requiring compulsory voting on shareholder resolutions rather than encouraging broader activism Contrary to what a lot of people may think corporate governance standards are much higher in the UK than anywhere else says David Gould director of invest ment at the National Association of Pension Funds He sees little activism in the US apart from at a few large public sector funds such as Calpers In the UK there are other ways in which shareholders can exercise direct control over executives through their scope to call extraordinary meetings for instance Tim Rees fund manager at Clerical Medical Investment Group one of the more active fund management groups on corporate governance says an example of the downside to legislation lies in voting If it was made mandatory most investors would vote blindly with the management thus diluting the impact of the investors who do take an activist stance  Another fund manager says the litigious environment in the US has a weakening effect on corporate governance He believes a fund manager could be sued by investors for pursuing activism if this incurred costs but failed in its objectives The industry argues that self-regulation has a much better chance of succeeding It points to the success of industry codes on such issues as splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive and the need for non-executive directors The ABI's investment guidelines introduced last year to improve UK companies' disclosure of their approach to corporate social responsibility in areas such as the environment is a seen a model for activism The government is expected to make a decision soon on whether to go down the legislative path It is understood to be considering a self-regulatory code but believes the industry would have to prove it would produce clear cut results If not legislation could be introduced as early as the autumn and be in place by the end of the year This is the first in a series on UK corporate governance,3

2002-06-28, For an idea of the scale of the demise of WorldCom look no further than May 2001 when the company raised $11 9bn in the capital markets and gained bragging rights for the second time to being the issuer of one of the market's biggest ever transactions WorldCom had credit ratings at the time of BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and A3 from Moody's Investors Service These levels are in the bottom half of investment grade range of creditworthiness ratings but are still comfortably within that range The fact that WorldCom was so rated by Moody's and S&P was undoubtedly a factor in attracting strong investor interest to its enormous bond issue which included tranches in euros and sterling as well as a mammoth US dollar issue At the time it was the third-biggest corporate bond issue ever behind issues of those two other insatiable borrowers Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom Indeed WorldCom had previously set a record in the bond markets In 1998 it issued $6 1bn of corporate bonds which at the time was the biggest such deal ever How different things are now Within hours of WorldCom's announcement that it had discovered a massive case of overstated earnings and fired its chief financial officer Moody's and S&P were slashing its creditworthiness levels to levels associated with imminent bankruptcy The move was an indication that the ratings agencies believed the company and those investors still holding its bonds were essentially doomed The two giants of the credit-rating business have been harshly criticised for their perceived inability to call Enron correctly Their stance on WorldCom which has not been subject to the same scrutiny has nevertheless also attracted criticism this time for a perceived over-reaction to the company's financial problems According to Carol Levenson a credit specialist at Gimme Credit an independent firm of analysts WorldCom along with Kmart and Enron is another example of a major issuer of debt that went directly from investment grade to distressed/bankrupt/near-bankrupt without even pausing for a cup of coffee in junk territory  The scale of WorldCom's slide down the creditworthiness scale has angered some investors When Richard Siderman one of S&P's senior telecoms analysts downgraded WorldCom's credit rating to B+ last week he was openly criticised by some holders of WorldCom's bonds Mr Siderman said yesterday that he had no inkling of this week's developments at the company and that the rating action was prompted by his doubts about its ability to secure a $5bn credit line Some investors felt S&P had moved too quickly since a decline in WorldCom's creditworthiness would make it more difficult to secure the credit facility and make it more expensive Further criticism has come from Sean Egan a founder of Egan-Jones Ratings an independent credit-rating firm that has not been recognised by the Securities and Exchange Commission Mr Egan claims to have been well ahead of either of the Big Two in his stance on Enron and WorldCom These claims are backed by some investors who are impressed with Egan-Jones's record in recent controversies Mr Egan said WorldCom should not have been able to raise $11 9bn last year and would not have been able to raise this money if its credit rating had been where it should have been  All of that is now moot S&P this week cut its credit rating on WorldCom to CCC- a level at which your bank manager does not return your calls Moody's cut its WorldCom rating to Ca from B1 ,2
2002-06-04, When Allianz turned to the capital markets last month to issue a record {XEU}2bn in subordinated debt which ranks between shareholder funds and senior debt in a company's capital structure to pay for its {XEU}27bn acquisition of Dresdner Bank it had every reason to be confident the deal would be well received by investors In fact the European financial services sector has outperformed the rest of the credit markets with yield spreads falling by 35 basis points in subordinated bank debt and by 22 basis points in combined insurance debt since October 2000 The financial services sector's outperformance is all the more striking when one considers that the introduction of the euro provoked a strong rise in the supply of subordinated financial debt as more and more issuers ventured out of their domestic markets to seek a broader international investor base In addition high levels of merger and acquisition activity in the industry have meant that a number of companies as was the case with the recent Allianz bond have needed to raise cash to expand The size of the market for subordinated debt has risen most rapidly in the insurance sector According to JP Morgan in 1998 the top 10 European insurers had {XEU}13bn of subordinated debt outstanding against a capital base of {XEU}140bn by 2001 this had risen to {XEU}31bn against a capital base of {XEU}150bn Subordinated debt is recognised by rating agencies and regulators as solvency capital and insurers have been making ever greater use of it to support their capital bases which have been eroded in particular by poor performing non-life businesses and more recently poorly performing equities says Roger Doig an equity analyst at JP Morgan In the credit markets the increase in subordinated debt supply has been matched by high levels of investor appetite In spite of the adverse effects of September 11 on the global insurance industry the sec tor has still benefited from safe-haven flows given the intact creditworthiness of most insurers Indeed one of the oddities of the most recent economic slowdown has been that financial services companies' asset quality has remained relatively unaffected with banks and insurance companies losing money mostly through lower revenues from market activities Better use of risk management instruments mainly hedging capabilities in the past few years has been the one of the main reasons the sector has maintained its status as safe debt amid the slowdown Another explanation for the strong demand for subordinated debt is that it is further down the issuer's capital structure ranking between senior debt and equity This means it is a more expensive source of funding for issuers with investors expecting higher returns For many fund managers putting money into subordinated debt means maintaining high credit quality while picking up additional yield says Paul Fenner-Leitao a European banks credit analyst at Lehman Brothers While the average rating for senior debt among European financials is close to the Double A mark subordinated debt is generally rated one or two notches below the same company's senior debt So subordinated debt has been a welcome instrument in the capital markets for both issuers and investors Yet some clouds have begun to appear on the horizon A number of financial services companies have been criticised for issuing subordinated debt as a balance sheet engineering operation in which subordinated debt is issued in an attempt to reduce a company's gearing Most ratings agencies offer substantial equity-like treatment to subordinated debt meaning that the funds will be treated as equity in gearing calculations This has prompted fears particularly among shareholders that subordinated debt is pushing many insurance companies' debt ratios above acceptable levels Increasing debt is a major risk to insurance shareholders says JP Morgan's Roger Doig And what may be worrying shareholders today could hurt bondholders in the future Many insurers are close to their maximum debt levels to sustain their ratings and will either have to be downgraded or cut dividends etc in order to conserve cash says Mr Doig ,2
2002-06-10, New Star Asset Management the fastest growing fund manager in the City has continued its strong fundraising track record by collecting £50m in about two weeks for a specialist fund for Patrick Eversheds its new manager The Select Opportunities Fund to be managed by 61-year-old Mr Eversheds is already oversubscribed despite difficult market conditions for raising funds from retail investors Mr Eversheds is one of the more colourful managers in the industry a staunch conservative who sealed his reputation at Rathbone Brothers an asset management group with a fund focused on undervalued companies The fund was centred on UK groups but in the somewhat individual style of Mr Eversheds up to 10 per cent was allowed to be invested in China Over the past three years he has been at the top of the Citywire performance list with the Rathbone Special Situations fund returning 127 per cent over three years and 105 per cent over five John Duffield founder of New Star said his company had raised about £830m from retail investors since it started marketing last July lifting funds under management to more than £2bn About 16 per cent of the £50m raised for the new vehicle for Mr Eversheds came from transfers from the Rathbone fund Mr Duffield said the fund would have the opportunistic and idiosyncratic style of Mr Eversheds Patrick has enormous experience and this enables him to make money even when the stock market is performing badly he said New Star Select Opportunities will focus on small companies But it will also have flexibility to invest in larger stocks and to place up to 20 per cent abroad Mr Duffield said at least part of the money would be invested in China ,2
2002-06-17, Companies with American Depositary Receipts have posted average annual returns of nearly 13 per cent since 1997 easily beating both their home stock markets and US indices according to a report that Citibank will release today The Bloomberg ADR index which includes 42 companies gained an average 12 8 per cent per year in US dollar terms while Salomon Smith Barney indices for the companies' home markets gained only 5 1 per cent a year since 1997 US stocks as measured by the broad Wilshire 5000 index were up 6 7 per cent annually over the same period ADRs posted their best performance in 1999 when they gained 80 4 per cent compared with 45 2 per cent for their home markets and 22 per cent for the US However they have managed to weather the downturns as well losing only 5 per cent last year compared with a 7 1 per cent drop in home market values and a 12 1 per cent decline in the US This year ADRs have continued to outperform gaining 3 7 per cent to the end of last month They correlate to whichever market home country or US is performing better said Michael Chafkin of Citibank's ADR group This is a phenomenon of cross-listing The correlation shifts and that's a unique advantage  The companies in Bloomberg's index are mainly blue-chip ADR companies including some multinationals They represent 11 emerging markets and 11 developed markets and they account for 55 per cent of ADR trading value Mr Chafkin acknowledges that the smaller less heavily traded ADR companies may produce different results However he says that he has done similar analysis with non blue-chip companies and while size may make the outperformance effect stronger Other explanations for the outperformance include a more diversified shareholder base a low cost of capital through enhanced liquidity and improved investor perceptions of good corporate governance and lower risk says Kurt Schneiber global managing director of the ADR group at Citibank Aside from performance figures Citibank's mid-year report highlights two divergent trends in the ADR market On the positive side international mutual funds took in a net $4 5bn in the first four months of 2002 signalling a coming increase in foreign stock purchases which could boost ADR prices even if funds invest in ordinary shares However there was some bad news from the Fed-eral Reserve which recorded a net outflow of $6 7bn from non-US equities including foreign shares and ADRs in the first quarter This was the first quarterly outflow to occur in nearly two years and is only the sixth since 1987 ADR trading volumes are down as well and this year's ADR capital raisings have totalled just $2 9bn compared with $3 8bn until this time last year Emerging market companies particularly those from Taiwan and Brazil have been the most active players in the field ,2

2002-04-11, Bernie's blues Adam Ingram armed forces minister got lots of media coverage on last week's PR jolly to Bagram air base Bernard Jenkin shadow defence secretary was much less exposed On landing in Kabul Ingram informed Jenkin that he was not cleared to visit Bagram preventing him from meeting the Royal Marine commandos Nor could he witness the passing out parade of the First Battalion of the Afghan National Guard Instead Jenkin had to make do with a visit to a local school poor value for the £1300 he paid from his own pocket for economy tickets to join Ingram who travelled first class on the trip Jenkin has moaned to Geoff Hoon Ingram's boss about an inexplicable snub to the official opposition who have unflinchingly supported the government in the war against terrorism His conclusion Matters were so arranged to exclude me from the government's spin  It's surely nothing to do with Labour's irritation at the emergency parliamentary debate that Jenkin managed to arrange on the dispatch of the Royal Marines ,3
2002-04-17, Proposals for introducing state funding for political parties in Britain in line with other European countries are gaining ground in the Labour administration as it fends off allegations about the influence donors are able to wield John Prescott deputy prime minister became the first senior member of the government to call openly for public funding when he was quoted yesterday as saying this was the only way of being properly accountable and protecting against charges of corruption Accusations began flying again at the weekend over a government contract for smallpox vaccine to be stored in case of biological attack It emerged that the chief executive of the British partner in the UK-Danish deal Powderject had donated £50000 $71900 to the governing Labour party Rival companies including one contracted to supply a different vaccine strain to the US complained they were not allowed to bid Previous cases that have led to charges of favours being bought include the government's backing for Lakshmi Mittal a London-based Indian businessman in a Romanian steel industry deal Another £1m donation received before Labour came to power had to be returned after allegations that it had influenced a decision to exempt motor racing from a ban on tobacco advertising Political parties have to be financed somehow and there is nowhere in the world where they get it all from membership subscriptions Mr Prescott said David Blunkett the powerful interior minister yesterday hinted that state funding might be the only option I think in the end if people are going to ridicule anyone and suspect anyone who gives funds to political parties we end up with the inevitable he said However Tony Blair prime minister is wary about proposing the change without consensus among the main parties fearing that taxpayers would see political funding as a poor way of spending their money Political analysts also point out that the widespread state funding of parties or election campaigns has not spared France Germany Italy Belgium or Spain from big political financing scandals The UK discussion follows legislation in the US against the use of soft money to bypass funding limits and measures by a number of US states to promote public financing in addition to public funds already available for presidential contests In the UK the only public support apart from concessions such as free television time is for opposition parties to carry out their parliamentary work The main parties are all overwhelmingly reliant on private donations including Labour which used to receive two-thirds of its funds from trade unions This proportion has now shrunk to below a third Changes that came into force last year cap parties' election budgets at just under £20m and oblige them to keep records of donations Gifts of more than £200 from individuals not registered as voters or companies outside the UK are barred ,3
1998-04-03, Andrew Parrish celebrated his first year as chief executive of Senior Engineering with news that full-year profits rebounded to £43 1m last year having been knocked to £2 7m in 1996 by the disposal of its thermal engineering division I am unashamedly optimistic about the long-term prospects for this business he said as Senior's shares rose from 184p to 202p Operating profits from continuing operations were 17 per cent ahead at £42m and the decision to link staff bonuses to cash flow improved inflows by 59 per cent Mr Parrish said Turnover on continuing operations dropped slightly to £443 6m £451 2m The strong performance came entirely from Flexonics the flexible tubing metal bellows and fluid carrying components business By contrast profits from engineered products and services which include precision tubing heat treatment and air systems dropped from £8 4m to £3 1m Mr Parrish said the division suffered from stock problems in Germany bad weather and rationalisation costs The strong pound also affected the translation of overseas profits by £2m He predicted a partial rebound for engineered products and services this year Senior could easily spend £75m this year without having to turn to shareholders for funding he added We have got a number of deals in the pipeline whereas we didn't have a pipeline 12 months ago He is eager to build up Senior's exposure to markets outside the US and Europe with a target that Asia should represent 10 per cent of group sales by 2001 compared to 1 per cent at present Senior should be manufacturing in Japan and South America by the end of the year he added Earnings per share were 10 48p compared with losses of 1 29p last year A proposed final dividend of 2 64p increases the total by 11 per cent to 4 24p Comment  TI Group may wish it had listened to the analysts who thought it might bid for Senior before Mr Parrish's arrival Since then the shares have doubled A lot of this has been down to bullish forecasts from Mr Parrish who says he has injected red corpuscles into the old Senior after the corporate enema of selling thermal engineering So far he is backing up the rhetoric with results and has assembled a strong team Its value-added products such as engine tubings are partly protected from the cycles of their markets because of increasingly stringent emissions legislation Senior is sorting engineered products out but the full recovery will take until 1999 This year Panmure Gordon expects pre-tax profits of £49 6m A p/e of 18 is high enough until evidence of that recovery starts to show ,2
2002-06-25, Poland is threatened with paralysis today at the hands of Self-Defence the burgeoning radical movement headed by former pig farmer Andrzej Lepper Thousands will take to the streets for a day of protest using farm machinery to block roads across the country It is set to be the largest demonstration yet against Leszek Miller's Socialist government which is struggling to revive Poland's economy and complete preparations to join the European Union It is also the latest direct action from the rural party that entered parliament in September on a wave of economic desperation and has risen in the polls by employing guerrilla tactics in the legislature EU officials privately express alarm at Self-Defence's ascendancy Similar concerns surround Slovakia Poland's neighbour where polls highlight authoritarian ex-leader Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia as a possible winner of national elections in September Self-Defence has made a mockery of Polish law enforcement with its illegal protests using public anger at political corruption and the economic pain associated with EU preparations to become the country's second most-popular political force Yet whereas Leszek Miller's ruling Democratic Left Alliance SLD once handled Self-Defence with kid gloves it now vows to fight Mr Lepper's lawlessness Officials say police and other security units will be ready to break the blockades using force if necessary Michal Tober government spokesman said This is a democratic country and everyone has the right to protest but they must do so in keeping with the law We will not allow anyone to paralyse the country  When Self-Defence entered the Sejm or lower house with 11 per cent of seats last year commentators hoped the exercise of power would civilise it Instead its MPs have repeat edly spoken out of order blocked the speaker's podium or used it to slander rivals Self-Defence supporters led by Mr Lepper occupied the Agriculture Ministry in May to protest against farm policy The party's MPs this month drove official limousines to a Warsaw rail junction and spilled imported German grain on to the tracks In doing so they returned to Self-Defence's roots as a radical farmers' union renowned for its illegal protests Henryk Dzido a senator with the group describes Self-Defence's politics as not liberal or communist but definitely leftist and Socialist Pawel Spiewak a sociologist with Warsaw University characterises it as proto-fascist He says It's based on negation and on resentment They want to destroy everything  Several Self-Defence MPs have faced criminal charges or official investigations for debt tax evasion and insurance fraud  alongside charges relating to the group's illegal demonstrations Parliamentary immunity has allowed most to avoid prosecution but Danuta Hojarska former co-chair of the Sejm's justice committee may have hers removed to face charges of fraud and forging a pass to visit her son in prison Mr Lepper alone has faced more than 100 criminal charges He began his activist career in 1992 after defaulting on a bank loan and says tomorrow's demonstration will be the first of many Invoking the symbolism of Solidarity the grassroots movement that toppled Polish communism the protest will mark the anniversary of a 1976 anti-government riot in Radom central Poland Mainstream commentators welcome the government's resolve to pursue a harder line against Self-Defence Polityka the venerable weekly read by Warsaw's elites said in an editorial this month that it was time to begin putting up blockades against those who can do nothing but block But the new toughness carries risks for Mr Miller's SLD The party relied on Self-Defence's votes to pass electoral and political vetting laws and may need the group to push through a contentious media bill this autumn says Mr Spiewak A firmer stance could also accelerate working-class voters' exodus from the SLD to Self-Defence A poll published last week showed Self-Defence with 18 per cent support its numbers are rising in inverse proportion as support for the SLD flags Self-Defence's radical tirades have resonated in Poland's city tower blocks and bankrupt collective farms The grain protest brought to light for example the fact that some ruling politicians profit from grain imports at a time when Polish reserves are bursting The government later ordered a review of how lucrative storage contracts are awarded With dozens of road blockades under their belts Self-Defence has become a master at staging protests and hijacking the media SLD officials recognise the risk that a clampdown on the radical group could feed a backlash but say there is no alternative Marek Dyduch the party's general secretary said If we show weakness now there will be more demonstrations more confrontations and more problems for the government ,3
2002-06-11, As if it did not have enough problems to cope withLondon's stock market hadto absorb another severe blow yesterday as Abbey National one of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders issued a shock profits warning writes Steve Thompson UK Stock Market Editor  That news sliced a whopping 10 per cent off Abbey shares at one stage and unnerved the rest of a banking sector which has been one of the market's stalwarts in recent years But even allowing for the steep losses in the banks the Footsie struggled manfully to remain in positive territory having fallen heavily for the three previous sessions During those three post-Jubilee sessions the FTSE 100 index London's benchmark dropped back below the 5000 level for the first time since early October last year It posted gains for much of the session and survived a late afternoon flurry of selling induced by news that the US authorities had arrested a terrorist planning a nuclear attack on the US That news saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average give up an earlier 54 points rally and dip into negative territory only to rally again At the finish of the session the FTSE 100 was 7 8 firmer at 4928 2 having been up 27 9 at best and down 15 4 at worst Footsie's resilience was not fully replicated by the midcaps and smallcaps but sentiment was given a boost by some welcome upside performances by many of the recently hammered TMT stocks such as Arm Holdings Vodafone and MMO{2} and drug stocks And there was a morale-lifting performance from Gallaher the UK's third-biggest tobacco group whose shares raced higher after weekend press reports that BAT the biggest UK tobacco company is mulling a bid for the company Of the other main indices the FTSE 250 lost 2 0 at 5960 4 and the SmallCap 6 2 at 2529 1 The Techmark rallied 11 21 to 950 45 The day's domestic economic news producer price input and output numbers had little impact on the market with the input number down 0 7 per cent much better than the consensus expectation of a flat figure and the 0 3 rise in output comparing with an expected 0 2 per cent increase There is nothing here to stoke up concerns about inflation said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics Dealers were generally impressed with the market's resilience especially after last week's dismal showing The market has taken the blows better than Mike Tyson did on Saturday night said one marketmaker bleary-eyed after a weekend packed with sporting events such as the football World Cup the Epsom Derby the world heavyweight boxing match won by Britain's Lennox Lewis and the Canadian Grand Prix But the bad news as far as those diversions were concerned came with another session of dismal levels of turnover which eventually settled at 1 8bn shares the lowest level for two weeks Warning floors Abbey Abbey National plunged 79 to 928p as analysts reacted to the mortgage bank's shock profits warning Abbey National blamed its first warning on additional provisioning and write-offs in the wholesale bank division in the first half as well as lower sales of with-profits bonds The news provided grim satisfaction for ING Financial Markets which just more than a week before had highlighted worries about the company's credit exposure to the US where credit quality was still deteriorating Fox Pitt-Kelton said it expected to slash its full-year estimates by 23 per cent or £300m We would recommend buying back into the shares about 900p when the 2002 yield support is about 5 8 per cent and the Group's capital position makes this relatively safe it said Schroder Salomon expected the provision to imply a charge for the whole year of about £450m compared with its previous forecast of £200m It retained a neutral rating medium risk with a 975p price target Dresdner Kleinwort repeated its reduce recommendation and said the shares would be underpinned at its 880p target However the company had at least one supporter Merrill Lynch said that based on the market's immediate reaction to the news the group was trading on 9 1 times next year's earnings We consider the shares to be particularly attractive on price weakness it said HSBC and Standard Chartered were dragged down by the Abbey effect and by negative comments from Merrill Lynch which said that both groups' Hong Kong operations would continue to deteriorate as conditions remained weak This coupled with rising consumer bad debts prompted Merrill to cut its earnings per share estimates for HSBC by 2 per cent in 2002 and by 3 per cent in 2003 Merrill said fair value for HSBC should be about $102bn-$111bn compared with its market capitalisation of $115bn Merrill made similar adjustments for Standard Chartered What's in a name The answer is $5m if you are a technology public relations group called OneMonday Group The company's lucky break came when PwC Consulting decided to join the ranks of oddly-named consortia and dub itself Monday on completion of its separation from PricewaterhouseCoopers later this year The purchase represented a quarter of OneMonday Group's market value The shares rose 3 to 32{1/2}p yesterday Reuters Group was higher in early dealings as investors responded to the purchase by Instinet of its trading platform rival Island ECN Instinet 83 per cent owned by Reuters agreed to buy unlisted Island ECN in an all-share deal valued at $508m The move is expected to create the largest alternative network for trading Nasdaq stocks with a combined market share of 22 per cent compared to about 30 per cent held by Nasdaq Reuters shares were 15 higher at best but slipped later to end the session a net 6 weaker at 461p By Peter John,2
2002-04-13, Bordeaux Thursday evening In a packed exhibition hall 8000 supporters have come to hear Lionel Jospin lay claim to the French presidency The event is one of the big set-pieces of the election campaign The media are out in force and the crowd loyally makes sure their candidate gets a rousing reception Yet even here among the party faithful of the south-west where the Socialists have strong support the body language is awkward Standing alone on the podium the 64-year-old Mr Jospin grips the lectern with the stiffness of a church elder reading the Bible When he hammers home a point he gesticulates with a tightly clenched fist He speaks fluently but without rhetorical flourish The pauses for applause are fractionally too deliberate For all the warmth of his reception Mr Jospin is no rabble-rouser His natural territory is intellectual argument the cut and thrust of parliamentary debate Taking to the campaign trail seems almost a chore necessary to achieving his ambition of defeating Jacques Chirac to win a five-year term as president of France The banners waved in the exhibition hall proclaim Jospin demain  Yet in truth victory is anything but assured With the first round of voting looming on April 21 the Socialists' candidate is trailing in the polls With his support in the first round vote having fallen to 20 per cent or lower Mr Jospin is under pressure to ensure that the 30 per cent of votes pledged to other leftwing candidates will be secured in the decisive second-round run-off Mr Chirac by contrast is having an easier time His rightwing rivals are showing poorly and nearly all have agreed to support the president in the second round Only Jean-Marie Le Pen veteran leader of the racist National Front who is forecast to pick up about 10 per cent of the first-round vote refuses to back Mr Chirac in the final round Even the Middle East crisis favours Mr Chirac who as president and head of state has responsibility for international affairs At Bordeaux there are signs that the Jospin camp is adjusting its message Gone are the baggy suits Instead his campaign team has dressed him in the clothes of a future president a well-fitting sober grey suit crisp white shirt and a pink tie His wavy white hair is neatly pressed down Noticeably less prominent is the slogan presider autrement which translates as a different way of presiding over France The wording is Mr Jospin's own a serious agenda for a serious man But it has proved largely ineffectual and some within his team criticise it as too vague and difficult to capture the voters' imagination This week a new slogan appears for the first time alongside it For a fairer France Fairness was one of no fewer than five themes that launched Mr Jospin's campaign more than six weeks ago But along with the abstract presider autrement the complexity of multiple messages is blamed for his lacklustre campaign There have been other misjudgments At the outset of his campaign Mr Jospin made a point of telling viewers in his first television interview that he was not running as a socialist The tactic a clear attempt to appeal to the electoral middle ground is now seen as a mistake confusing the socialist heartland while ceding too much ground to the six other leftwing candidates As one leading pollster put it this week He began his campaign thinking it was all important to aim for the second round when first of all he had to make sure he does not alienate his core support  In Bordeaux almost as soon as he takes the podium Mr Jospin declares I am a man of the left  The loud applause produces a rare grin To emphasise the point the guest is Lula da Silva the radical Brazilian politician who is running for the presidency in his home country later this year as head of the PT the workers' party Referring to my friend Lionel Lula stresses the similarities between their political platforms The two men make sure of a very public embrace Mr Jospin is anxious to capture the growing anti-globalisation sentiment in France and Lula's appearance provides an opportunity to raise the issue of Third World development Lula is a key figure in the movement with the Porto Alegre conference a key meeting place for such activists To demonstrate his colours Mr Jospin pledges I am in favour if elected president of France of proposing that all poor countries' debt be cancelled  He also uses the occasion to remind his audience how the left in France has been behind the country's social gains In a further attempt to differentiate himself from Mr Chirac in a campaign seen as often having two sides with the same views he declares The real divide with the right is that I am on the side of social justice  To prove the point Mr Jospin lauds his achievement of introducing a 35-hour week and youth employment schemes He promises to create 900000 jobs over the next five years And to reinforce further his move away from the centre he gives prominence to Henri Emmanuelli a local deputy and one of his severest critics who has often taken him to task for the government's neo-liberal policies Mr Chirac is mentioned by name only once Previous personal attacks on the president in particular that he is aged and worn out by office have not gone down well with voters Instead Mr Jospin snipes obliquely at his rival's record as head of state including his refusal to be questioned by judges investigating corruption at Paris city hall while Mr Chirac was mayor No one should be above the law Mr Jospin says pointedly In all he speaks for 80 minutes

2002-06-27, Do not expect to see any complex Enron-style diagrams detailing the alleged accounting fraud at WorldCom judged on the available information accounting experts agree that what the telecommunications company did was one of the simplest accounting tricks in the book Robert Willens accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers said yesterday There is no great issue as to the proper treatment of these items The thing that has to bother you was how in the world this was missed This is the most fundamental accounting issue whether to capitalise or expense an outlay  According to WorldCom some $3 8bn was transferred from line cost expenses to capital in 2001 and the first quarter of this year This had several flattering effects on the key measures of the company's performance at a point at which it was under intense scrutiny as the telecoms bubble of the late 1990s deflated  Assets can be depreciated over a long period therefore WorldCom avoided having to record an immediate cash cost and inflated net income In fact WorldCom said that if it had accounted for the expenses correctly it would have reported a net loss for 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 It is not clear how great the restatement of income will be  The depreciating cost of these assets did not show up in earnings before interest tax and depreciation ebitda one of the most important measures of WorldCom's financial health After the restatement 2001 ebitda was $6 3bn rather than the $10 5bn declared and in the first quarter of 2002 it was $1 4bn rather than $2 2bn Ebitda margins were obviously flattered by a similar amount In 2001 rather than having ebitda margins of 49 per cent the real margin was 30 per cent In the first quarter rather than ebitda margins of 43 per cent the margin was actually 28 per cent Operating cash flow another important measure for analysts following telecoms companies was also flattered  Capital expenditure was inflated by the transfer of expenses to assets Analysts are now keen to see a reduction in spending by telecoms companies that over-invested in the boom indeed John Sidgmore WorldCom chief executive reiterated on Tuesday that the group was still committed to cutting capex to $2 1bn in 2003 Declared capital expenditure fell from $11 48bn in 2000 to $7 89bn last year But the real figure was only $4 8bn a more drastic cut that might have alerted analysts to serious problems at the long-distance telephony giant  On the other hand line costs were obviously higher than reported In 2001 WorldCom said it had edged up from 40 per cent to 42 per cent of revenues But in reality they had leapt to 50 per cent of revenues Accountancy experts agree that there are grey areas in accounting standards on how to capitalise spending As a result the literature lists numerous cases of aggressive and improper capitalisation of expenses Joseph Carcello accounting professor at the University of Tennessee says GAAP generally accepted accounting principles in that area isn't real definitive    most of the guidance is industry guidance  On two counts there is no doubt that what WorldCom did was in breach of both the spirit and the letter of accounting principles First the company said in its 2001 annual report that the principal components of line costs are access charges and transport charges essentially payments for the use of other companies' telecoms networks Mr Carcello says That's paying for a service during a particular period I don't know how you argue that that's part of a physical asset that's going to have a 10 20 or 30-year life  Second according to WorldCom's brief account of what happened the expenses were not wrongly classified as capital assets they were transferred to capital accounts That suggests that these were costs formally recorded as expenses and then simply switched to the capital line when the accounts were drawn up Creditsights an independent credit analysis firm said in a note yesterday that 'transfers' implies an active change in accounting treatment This is accounting 101 added Mr Willens at Lehman Brothers To think this could have been missed by so many people is troubling investors at least the ones I have spoken to today They are ready to throw in the towel on the market because there is a belief that the numbers can't be trusted in almost every case I have never heard this kind of outrage and I have been doing this 33 years People are just disgusted  Additional reporting by Andrew Balls and Gary Silverman,2

2002-04-24, Lockheed Martin the largest US defence contractor said first-quarter earnings more than doubled buoyed by growth in military aircraft and recovery in commercial space activities Net earnings jumped from $105m to $218m in the three months to the end of March as revenues increased by 26 per cent to $6bn Earnings per share rose to 49 cents from 25 cents for the same period a year ago The group confirmed yesterday it was on target to meet its full-year earnings target of between $2 45 and $2 50 per share and would deliver a further 10 per cent growth in 2003 The results were lifted by increased sales in the military aircraft division up 56 per cent to $1 3bn The biggest single contributor was the ramp-up on production of the F-22 Raptor the US Air Force next-generation air superiority fighter Turnover in the space business grew by a third to $1 9bn helped by three commercial launches in the first quarter compared with none in the same period of 2001 Lockheed Martin's prospects look much brighter than two years ago when it was faced with significant problems in both key activities It has also started reducing its huge debt burden built up after a string of acquisitions It booked $8 5bn in new contracts in the first quarter lifting its order backlog to a record $73 8bn already swelled by a win over Boeing in the competition to build the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter late last year Its shares have performed strongly since the start of the year gaining more than 25 per cent buoyed by the increase in US defence spending to support the country's war against terrorism The shares were up again in midday trading yesterday gaining $2 02 to $61 15 The company pulled out of the telecommunications business last year and took a $1 7bn charge that pushed it into a full-year net loss in 2001 ,2

2002-04-09, From Mr Walter Higgins Sir It has become too convenient to loosely toss around the Enron name in an effort to make a scandal out of the other real issues that still confront local utilities and their customers in the wake of the California energy debacle John Dizard's article Enron contagion is hard to contain March 15 took this tactic to a new low by insinuating that somehow there was a connection between our failed acquisition of an Enron utility subsidiary and our own power purchases months before from Enron wholesale trading affiliates His puzzling conclusions are divorced of logic and the facts to say nothing of the thousands of pages of testimony and evidence He suggests that we purchased more power at a higher price from Enron as a way to hide payment of large break-up fees for the failed acquisition of Enron's utility Portland General Electric This strains common sense to the breaking point First most of the power purchases were made in the first two months of 2001 at a time when we and Enron were seeking to consummate the transaction and fully two months before the growing crisis in the west forced us to cancel the transaction by mutual agreement Second the record is crystal clear and even our most strident critics make no case that these purchases were at other than prevailing market prices It does not seem to concern Mr Dizard that there was no value underlying his alleged payoff scheme Finally as Mr Dizard acknowledges the purchases were made through intermediary brokers so it is hard for a reasonable person to imagine how we were supposed to know how much of the power even came from or passed through Enron Mr Dizard leaps over mountains of sworn testimony ahead of the real experts to reach an absurd conclusion The California energy crisis that engulfed Nevada may beg easy culprits and simplistic solutions but it is disappointing that he avoided the deeper and more complex issues that deserve fair treatment and thoughtful debate Walter Higgins Chairman and Chief Executive Sierra Pacific Resources Las Vegas Nevada US,3
2002-04-24, Few people care to pick a fight with John Ritblat the smoothly charismatic and pugnacious chairman who built British Land into one of the UK's largest and most innovative property companies So the property sector is agog at the possibility of a challenge to his strategy The gauntlet has been thrown by Laxey Partners a little-known value fund manager that has asked for two resolutions to be put to the annual meeting One would force British Land to buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares at either 700p compared with last night's close of 582p up 17p on the news or 90 per cent of diluted net asset value per share The other would require it to carry on with buy-backs half-yearly if the NAV discount was wider than 15 per cent Most big property companies stand at a discount to NAV though British Land's shares have long been on a wider one than most and certainly far greater than 15 per cent The latest Merrill Lynch data put the gap at about 30 per cent compared with 19 per cent for Land Securities even though this year the shares have been among the sector's best Faced with NAV discounts many large property companies have bought back shares to improve returns to investors British Land along with Slough Estates has not The company was silent yesterday but it previously argued that its high gearing on a large asset base might produce much greater NAV growth Just why its discount should be so wide is far from clear It has after all some of the sector's best assets and the news over the past year has generally been positive with good results some new management blood and a favourable securitisation Some put it down to a suspicion the company is interested in size for its own sake Two immediate questions arise First can Laxey really mount a challenge It only holds 2 per cent of the shares and 5 per cent or the signatures of 100 investors are normally needed for an AGM resolution Laxey however thinks it has got round this by dividing its holding between 100 specially created subsidiaries No doubt British Land's solicitors are scouring the law books Second are its resolutions sensible Some large shareholders say they would welcome pressure on the board to buy back shares though one wonders why they are incapable of doing this themselves But the buy-back trigger levels set by Laxey look too tight given the performance of the sector in recent years and the management could reasonably claim its hands would be too closely tied Still a vote would would give a good indication of what the company's owners really want ,1
2002-06-04, The planned sale of Bank-gesellschaft Berlin the loss-making financial institution controlled by the city state of Berlin entered a decisive phase yesterday as four bidders were admitted into the company's so-called data room The one domestic and three foreign groups interested in the troubled bank 81 per cent owned by the Berlin authorities have four weeks to assess detailed information about the bank's health The Berlin city government believes that should be long enough for indicative offers to be submitted before the end-July deadline set for detailed talks with one or possibly two final bidders Thilo Sarrazin Berlin's finance senator who is being advised by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said he hoped that negotiations could be concluded in the autumn with a view to closing the deal by early next year In an interview Mr Sarrazin said he felt assured a bidder would come forward in spite of concerns about Bankgesellschaft's financial condition and political resistance to a sale I'm confident we'll receive at least one offer he said Selling the bank would conclude one of the most expensive and politically charged German privatisations in years In September 2001 Berlin injected {XEU}1 75bn $1 6bn in fresh capital to keep Bankgesellschaft afloat after the reassessment of controversial property loans and real estate funds It followed up last April with a decision to take on guarantees on the bank's property activities a financial commitment that could cost at least {XEU}6bn over coming years Mr Sarrazin declined to confirm the names of the prospective bidders known to include a consortium of Germany's savings bank association and Norddeutsche Landesbank the regional bank The foreign bidders include WL Ross a US private equity specialist and an alliance of Christopher Flowers and Texas Pacific Group two formerly competing parties The other bidder is reported to be Lone Star Fund a Dallas-based private equity group that has invested in property in eastern Germany Mr Sarrazin declined to speculate on what would happen if one of the foreign private equity groups which would offer cash were pitted against the German consortium NordLB and the savings bank association have set great store on ensuring that savings banks in the Berlin region currently owned by Bankgesellschaft remain part of Germany's savings bank structure However the consortium which faces financial constraints is expected to propose some form of alliance or possibly merger between Bankgesellschaft and NordLB making its bid difficult to compare with a cash offer I've said publicly I prefer cash said Mr Sarrazin who is grappling with Berlin's {XEU}40bn debts But he admitted that in such circumstances a choice between the German group and a foreign bidder could be difficult with political factors playing an important part ,1
2002-06-11, When Mark Pain and Stephen Hester stand up in front of Abbey National shareholders today they will not be expecting a warm reception The bank's former finance director now head of its wholesale bank and its new finance director were behind yesterday's profit warning that shocked the market and knocked more than 7 per cent off the share price Today shareholders will be concentrating on the wholesale bank and its heavy investments in junk bonds But Abbey's problems go much deeper than the one troubled division all of its businesses appear to have run out of steam Mr Pain took over the wholesale bank at the end of last year after it emerged that Abbey better known for mortgages had invested heavily in US junk bonds and Enron In total the bank wrote off £256m from its £1 5bn of junk bonds last year and in April prepared investors for a similar write-off this year Mr Pain and Mr Hester decided in the past few weeks that more was needed to cushion the troubled division against future losses It has bought partial protection against losses on £800m of its junk bonds using a credit derivative Yesterday the bank warned that provisions against junk bonds failed private equity investments and customers in the telecommunications and cable sectors would be closer to £440m this year Even worse the rise in provisions is not just the one-off kitchen sink exercise that typically follows the appointment of a new finance director Mr Hester indicated that provisions in future years would be well above £100m to £150m compared with just £32m two years ago We have tried to see where there are black clouds hovering over our portfolio even if it hasn't started to rain yet he said This did not go down well with the market It is a shambles said one analyst If the wholesale bank's problems were the only thing wrong with Abbey they could be dismissed as just a little local difficulty After all the division grew from nothing 10 years ago to make a profit of £504m last year even after the hefty provisions Ian Harley chief executive remains relentlessly upbeat The underlying business is in pretty good shape he said There are good organic growth prospects around  But there is little to dispel the sense of gloom surrounding the bank's Baker Street headquarters The life assurance business has been hit by falling sales of with-profits bonds one of the mainstays of Scottish Mutual while profits in the core retail bank are being held back by investment and rising costs They are not strong anywhere said John-Paul Crutchley banks analyst at Merrill Lynch They are still losing mortgage market share even in the current stonking market for mortgages he added The life business has gone ex-growth Wholesale has imploded So what's left There is nothing to get excited about in this business  Were Abbey any ordinary company its floundering would attract the attention of predators But after Lloyds TSB's attempt to buy the bank was blocked by the government last year for being anti-competitive Abbey is immune to bids by its larger UK rivals Overseas bids remain possible but mounting a hostile bank takeover from another country is seen as close to impossible This is a company that doesn't face the ultimate sanction of losing its independence an analyst said Which has left the shares supported solely by the dividend yield one of the highest in the sector The bank warned yesterday that the dividend would not be increased by as much as last year's 10 per cent prompting analysts to downgrade their forecasts to a 5 per cent rise Even this could prove challenging if the bank makes any more mistakes This year's dividend is only covered 1 3 times by profits and Morgan Stanley estimates that next year's will only be covered 1 5-1 6 times You have to wonder how they are going to maintain dividend increases said Robin Down banks analyst at Morgan Stanley Mr Hester insists that future dividend increases are not under threat because the more conservative approach to the wholesale bank should reduce the amount of capital it needs He will need all the charm developed during his years as a CSFB investment banker to convince shareholders of this If he fails at least he can escape quickly he bought a helicopter with some of the millions he earned in his former job ,2
2002-06-26, WorldCom the telecommunications group that Bernie Ebbers cobbled together through a series of 75 acquisitions had come to symbolise many of the excesses of the takeover era Now the company which ousted Mr Ebbers as chief executive less than two months ago looks set to join the illustrious ranks of Enron and other US corporations accused of using improper accounting methods The news that WorldCom will review $3 9bn in expenses and could be forced to drastically restate its earnings threatens to topple the group once viewed as the most feared company in the telecoms sector Its shares dipped below $1 this week and plunged 75 per cent to 23 cents following news of accounting irregularities The company's admission late yesterday only adds to a breathtaking story of the group's rise to the top of the telecoms sector and its recent collapse Mr Ebbers began his series of deals in 1995 leading to the $37bn acquisition of MCI at the time the biggest merger ever completed That deal was followed by a failed attempt to buy rival Sprint for $115bn At its peak WorldCom's market value reached $180bn Through all of the dealmaking Mr Ebbers had a close ally in his chief financial officer Scott Sullivan Mr Sullivan was last night fired by WorldCom following an internal audit that exposed a $3bn discrepancy in 2001 earnings For more than a year Mr Sullivan was criticised in some quarters for his use of pro forma accounting techniques Critics complained that the company restated earnings each time it completed a deal making it difficult to gauge performance Another key ally of Mr Ebbers Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman who became known for his bullish stance on WorldCom dealt the group a blow this week by cutting his rating on the shares to underperform The move did not just hurt the company's share price it was a sign of how dramatically the group's fortunes had changed The company's rapid-fire acquisitions had already attracted the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission this year Yesterday WorldCom said it had notified the SEC that its financial statements for 2001 and first quarter of 2002 were misleading John Sidgmore WorldCom's newly elected CEO has attempted to resurrect the company's reputation and reassure Wall Street that it was not facing a liquidity crisis The group has tried to raise a new $5bn credit facility and Mr Sidgmore has been expected to deliver the results of a wide-ranging strategic review It was expected that this could include the loss of as many as 16000 jobs Mr Sigmore has said that despite WorldCom's financial difficulties he is determined not to scale back operations with the greatest long-term growth potential including its international business Despite these efforts the group has suffered new ratings downgrades and intense concerns that it may not survive without drastic measures ,2
2002-06-17, John Wren chief executive of Omnicom the world's third biggest advertising group yesterday promised a vigorous campaign to restore the company's battered image following questions about its accounting policies There are no skeletons in the closet he said in an interview The integrity of this company its management its board of directors and its employees is paramount to everything we do just as it always has been We are going to go out and re-explain the company what we do and how we do it and I believe when people hear all the facts and take a deep breath and pause they will understand what's what  In the last two weeks Omnicom's share price has plunged 36 per cent following questions about its accounting policies and the sudden resignation last month of Robert Callander the chairman of its audit committee Financial markets were alarmed by newspaper reports that drew attention to several areas of concern including Omnicom's method of distinguishing between organic growth and contributions from acquisitions The advertising and marketing industry is consolidating and like WPP and Interpublic the other two big advertising groups Omnicom has been a voracious buyer of smaller companies Mr Wren said You have an attitude on Wall Street that all acquirers are conglomerates We're not we're a holding company and we're in an industry where acquisitions are important to everyone but it's in the ether at the moment  Mr Callander resigned as chairman of Omnicom's audit committee last month and the group last week appointed KPMG to be its auditor to replace Andersen People close to the company say Mr Wren and the other directors are privately outraged by the published insinuations but that Mr Wren wants to address them publicly in a disciplined and orderly manner As part of the campaign the outside directors will give their version of the events leading up to Mr Callander's resignation Limiting the damage Page 28 ,1

2002-06-08, MG Rover is seeking to take control of Daewoo FSO the Polish carmaking operations of South Korea's bankrupt Daewoo industrial group The strategy would be to use the operation as a manufacturing and distribution base from which to attack the car markets of central and eastern Europe The audacious move the latest of a series by the now UK-owned carmaker bought from BMW for £10 two years ago was disclosed jointly by MG Rover executive and Polish government officials in Warsaw yesterday Neither party would give details of the financial structure or investment details of the project The deal would see MG Rover produce both its own models and possibly some of the vehicles already in production at the plant It is expected that a new company would be created from the assets of Daewoo-FSO which was set up in the mid-1990s as a joint venture between Daewoo and the Polish government Those close to the negotiations said no firm deal had yet been struck but the Polish government and MG Rover had been in exclusive negotiations over the Zeran plant and the Polish distribution network for some time The Zeran facility near Warsaw is still producing the Daewoo Matiz Nubira and Lanos ranges along with the ageing Polonez model based on a Fiat The plant has a capacity of 50000 cars a year although its workforce has been halved and production cut while the Polish government has sought to secure its future after Daewoo's collapse The Polish operations are among about a dozen around the world not covered under General Motors' agreement to take over the majority of the Korean group's automotive assets MG Rover has been producing about 170000 cars a year at its Longbridge plant in Birmingham which has capacity for building more than 200000 a year even excluding a new factory intended for the BMW Mini but never used However MG Rover executives say a successful expansion of its sales activities into central and eastern Europe would require local production Any deal is likely to involve the Polish government in providing substantial assistance to MG Rover to keep the plant going It has been seeking a rescuer from the automotive industry for some time and has made several offers of loan guarantees in the past The negotiations come as MG Rover is still having trouble stemming a sales decline across western Europe although it is undergoing a revival in the UK In the first four months of this year its total western European sales fell by 7 per cent year-on-year against a 2 8 per cent drop in the UK new car market overall ,1
2002-06-10, Matt Metcalfe a 27-year-old doctor has just sold a mais-onette in Clifton Bristol for £240000 just five years after buying it for a mere £80000 But the mushrooming property prices that are such good news for Dr Metcalfe are causing severe difficulties for others in south-west England Social workers care assist-ants and others on low public sector wages are finding it difficult to buy a home In turn that is making it more difficult for local authorities to attract staff and putting pressure on them to increase salaries Labour shortages have not reached the proportions facing London and the south-east where council leaders say there are severe recruitment problems And the problem is not region-wide Cornwall has the lowest wages in England But Bristol is one of the few areas outside the south-east to have an NHS cost-of-living allowance which applies to nurses and other health workers The private sector too is offering incentives to workers along the M4 corridor The south-west branch of the Local Government Association says average house prices in the south-west are six times higher than average wages In the north-west for example the ratio is just four The only answer say south-west councils is hundreds of millions of pounds in extra grants from the government to pay for higher salaries There is a precedent Under a system set up in 1987 London and the south-east receive a cash top-up called the area cost adjust-ment to make up for the higher cost of living in the two regions The allowance worth £1 9bn last year is equivalent to 4 5 per cent of the £50bn standard spending assessment for England the total amount the government thinks councils need to deliver services The system has its critics even in the south-east Ken Livingstone London mayor claims the capital receives far too little government grant in relation to its contribution to the exchequer And some south- east councils object to the way the allowance falls in proportion to distance from the centre of London a crude measure that does not always accurately reflect cost pressures Steve Lord the LGA's head of grant distribution also cites concern about the cliff edges of the system regional boundaries mean that Southampton and Oxford qualify for the allowance but Bournemouth and Cambridge do not North of London many MPs say that the adjustment should be scrapped Some claim that it is morally unjustified because it subsidises services in the richest parts of the country The suggestion that it be extended to the south-west would be particularly controversial because a revaluation of council tax bands in 2007 is likely to provide extra income for local authorities such as Bristol Bath and Swindon as house prices push many tax-payers into a higher bracket A new formula to replace the standard spending assessment is expected next spring and the area cost adjustment scheme is being reviewed as part of that process However councils in the south-east fear that ministers are more likely to scrap the system than extend it Their south-west colleagues will be hoping fervently they are wrong ,1

2002-04-18, Philip Morris said yesterday there was no certainty that it would reach a deal to sell Miller Brewing to South African Breweries and that a turnround in its brewing arm was on plan Louis Camilleri who will succeed Geoffrey Bible as Philip Morris chief executive next week added that the company would explore any deals it deemed favourable to Miller and its share-holders The comments came as the world's largest tobacco company reported underlying first-quarter net income up 5 9 per cent from $2 34bn to $2 47bn on sales up 2 9 per cent to $20 5bn Earnings per share increased 8 6 per cent to $1 14 Philip Morris confirmed earlier this month it was in talks with SAB over Miller which has been battling to reverse declining market share in the US Mr Camilleri said Miller's first-quarter domestic shipment volumes had risen 1 6 per cent boosted by Skyy Blue a new ready-to-drink vodka beverage Volumes for Miller's core brands including Miller Lite and Foster's in the US also grew 1 6 per cent He added this was the second successive quarter of improved performance from Miller indicating that the business was starting to turn round Underlying operating profits increased 4 8 per cent to $130m Asked if he was still enthusiastic about selling Miller given its improving fortunes Mr Camilleri noted that Philip Morris had said only that it was in talks with SAB on a transaction Analysts speculate that any SAB deal likely to value Miller at about $5bn would be for a mixture of cash and shares That would leave Philip Morris with a stake in the enlarged group While we will be focused on improving the business and the improvements are starting to show we are not oblivious to what is going on in the whole brewing industry said Mr Camilleri Mr Camilleri said his arrival as chief executive next week would not trigger any change in strategy The strategies that we have adopted over the past five years have worked very well so why change them Mr Camilleri said We are growing well we have strong momentum  Analysts have suggested a successful Miller sale plus the strong performance of its Kraft Foods division which on Tuesday reported first-quarter earnings up 20 per cent could prompt Philip Morris to consider a full spin-off of the business That would leave Philip Morris which is proposing to change its name to Altria Group focused on tobacco Operating profits in the US tobacco business increased 4 per cent to $1 3bn helped by higher pricing and volumes International tobacco lifted operating profits just 0 4 per cent to $1 6bn with volume and price gains offset by unfavourable currency movements ,1
2002-06-15, The World Bank confirmed yesterday that a report it commissioned on a controversial air traffic control system for Tanzania raised concerns about value for money The deal has divided the UK government with the Department for International Development opposing the deal but being overruled by Tony Blair prime minister with the support of the trade and industry department The report from the International Civil Aviation Organisation says the $39m £27m Tanzania deal being built by the UK company BAE Systems is based on outdated technology and is nearly 10 times more expensive than necessary The ball is now in the UK and Tanzanian governments' court a World Bank official Said If Tanzania completes the deal it could jeopardise future funding from rich country donors and the World Bank Development campaigners have already expressed concern about the financing terms of the deal arranged by Barclays Bank which although at below-market interest rates is more costly than the normal borrowing by a country as poor as Tanzania Some officials familiar with the situation in Tanzania also said it appeared that $32m of the $39m had already been paid to BAE Systems This contradicts a widespread belief among government officials that the deal was being suspended pending completion of the ICAO report BAE Systems yesterday denied there had been any agreement to suspend construction and said that the system was now largely complete BAE Systems also hit back at the ICAO report saying it contained several errors of fact and that the deal represented good value for money ,1
2002-06-05, Brilliance China Automotive BCA should be celebratinggovernment clearance for its move into the saloon car market but instead the mainland's third-largest auto maker finds itself under renewed official scrutiny The go-ahead to produce the Zhonghua was seen as a signal that the Chinese government would finally approve a planned joint venture with BMW the latest automaker to court the influential BCA Yang Rong BCA chairman has overseen a company dogged in recent months by investor concerns over its complex corporate structure and BCA finds itself the subject of an official investigation into allegations of asset stripping among its sprawling network of subsidiaries The investigation centres on the ownership of an educational foundation backed by the People's Bank of China the country's central bank and BCA's controlling shareholder BCA's Hong Kong-listed shares dropped sharply last week wiping out gains achieved after the Zhonghua approval and the stock price of a related Shanghai-listed company fell sharply this week The investigation is also a concern for BCA's existing overseas partners including General Motors and MG Rover the UK company with which it signed an industrial alliance earlier this year One subject of investigation is why Mr Yang one of China's most respected businessmen failed to carry out in full an internal 1999 finance ministry decree that ordered the transfer of the BCA shares held by the Chinese Financial Education Development Foundation the non-profit body controlled by the People's Bank of China The directive ordered the stake be transferred to Zhongjin Fengde an asset management company owned by the finance ministry and the Communist party Officials said the central bank had been angered by its continuing association with the foundation which is registered in Bermuda and which had become the focus of investor concerns over BCA's lack of transparency According to the company's website the foundation still owns 47 63 per cent of BCA shares although analysts suggested yesterday that this had fallen to 39 per cent The other 8 per cent once held by the foundation through a company called Zhuhai Brilliance was now controlled by Mr Yang said one analyst The focus on the company's structure has clouded analysis of its underlying businesses and the prospects for its joint ventures with overseas partners BCA is understood to have made a significant cash payment estimated at $300m to MG Rover as part of that alliance which would involve two new models likely to be assembled at a new plant at Ningbo near Shanghai BMW MG Rover's former parent said it was hopeful of receiving a licence shortly from the Chinese authorities to begin assembly of its best-selling 3 and 5-series models BMW hopes to build about 20000 units a year with BCA There are also signs of disagreement between BCA and its existing partners BCA's joint venture with GM which manufactures sports utility vehicles suffered a net loss last year with Mr Yang citing sales that fell far short of our targets Phil Murtagh chairman of GM in China disputed the progress of sales and said losses were in line with expectations Mr Yang meanwhile is making a show of business as usual chairing a shareholders' meeting of the Shanghai-listed company on Friday Officials at BCA could not be reached for comment about the investigation but a spokesman told the Chinese media at the shareholders' meeting that the company was surprised to hear of any such move ,1

2002-04-23, Gerry Adams was last night under pressure to attend a US congressional hearing into alleged links between the IRA and anti-government guerrillas in Colombia But the Sinn Fein president is seeking to make his appearance conditional on the hearing being postponed until after the Irish general election Mr Adams leader of the IRA's political wing is worried the negative publicity that could flow from the hearings of the US House of Representatives foreign relations committee would damage the party's chances in those elections Bertie Ahern the Irish prime minister is expected this week to call an election for mid May Sinn Fein is seeking to increase its representation in the Dail the lower house of the Irish parliament where it has one deputy Mr Adams was last night meeting senior party officials in Belfast before deciding whether to take up the congressional invitation which was issued after the arrest in Colombia last August of three senior republicans on suspicion of offering weapons training to Farc one of three Colombian rebel groups designated as terrorists by the US State Department Irish diplomats believe the Sinn Fein leader has come under pressure to attend following damaging rumours about the state of the IRA ceasefire The group has been linked by security sources to last month's raid on the Belfast Special Branch headquarters at Castlereagh and the discovery by police of an IRA hit list of Conservative party figures in a search of republican homes in north Belfast Iain Duncan Smith Tory party leader yesterday met Tony Blair to discuss the hit list After the meeting on private privy council terms Mr Duncan Smith said the prime minister had assured him he was treating the list with the utmost seriousness Mr Duncan Smith was accompanied by Quentin Davies shadow Northern Ireland secretary and Mr Blair was joined by John Reid the Northern Ireland secretary The IRA denied being behind the Castlereagh raid or of targeting leading politicians It also denied newspaper reports that it had secretly bought guns in Moscow Mr Reid insists there is no imminent threat to the IRA ceasefire but has been careful not to say whether involvement in the raid on Castlereagh would constitute a breach of its ceasefire David Trimble Ulster Unionist leader and first minister in the Northern Ireland executive yesterday met the province's police chiefs He later said he was asking for a meeting with Mr Adams and Martin McGuin-ness Sinn Fein education minister to seek assurances on the IRA ceasefire Mr Trimble said the impact of this month's second reported act of decommissioning by the IRA had been totally dissipated and destroyed by the rumours The allegations are part of a barrage of claims and counter claims by security services against republicans Mr Trimble said he would also be seeking a meeting with Mr Blair to discuss reports that the IRA had been importing weapons from Russia Police here say that they have no information to support that I'm not saying it's untrue it's just that the Northern Ireland police have no information so I want to find out does London have any information to support that  Mitchel McLaughlin Sinn Fein chairman said the claims were part of an attempt by members of the security forces to divert attention from their involvement in the Castlereagh break-in ,3
2002-06-28, When the news broke this week that WorldCom was being investigated for improperly accounting for billions of dollars it not only sent a jolt through world financial markets It also transformed an obscure race for a congressional House seat in Mississippi where WorldCom is based into a significant showcase for the issue of corporate wrongdoing in this year's congressional elections Ronnie Shows the Democratic candidate in the race pounced on his Republican opponent Chip Pickering for having accepted campaign contributions from WorldCom and sought to portray him as a friend of big business This is Enron on a larger scale said Mr Shows seeking to underscore Republican ties with failing corporate giants Shady book-keeping and alleged corporate misdeeds are transforming the political landscape as Democrats and Republicans struggle to find the winning formula in this year's race for control of Congress Democrats need to pick up just six seats to wrest the House majority from Republicans With only a handful of truly competitive contests including the one in Mississippi Democrats see advantage in bashing Republicans for their close ties to the business community But Democrats face their own dilemma since they have spent most of the past decade trying to court business support and cultivate candidates who fit the pro-free-trade pro-business New Democrat mould It will be a challenge for those of us Democrats who are pro-business says Cal Dooley a California congressman who is one of the House's leading New Democrats I make no apologies for the bad actors in the corporate community At the same time it will be important not to paint everyone with the same brush  For Republican candidates the challenge is clearly one of reconciling their long-standing close ties to business with the emerging political imperative to reassure voters that they do not condone the crooked path many corporations followed in the freewheeling 1990s Republicans also have the advantage so far of having a president in the White House whose approval ratings continue to ride high But that may not be enough to shield individual Republican candidates from charges of being too cozy with corporate interests And not even a surge of patriotic fervour favouring the president may be enough to save them Law and order is going to be a central issue in this year's elections says Marshall Wittmann a senior fellow at the right-leaning Hudson Institute But it is not going to be crime in the streets that is the issue It is going to be crime in the suites  Political analysts believe the potency of the corporate corruption issue will be determined in part by the economy The loss of jobs and retirement income security coupled with investors' stock market hits could drive angry voters at the polls If Republicans are identified with the perpetrators of those losses they will catch the blame It is not just the congressional elections where the issue of corporate malfeasance is likely to take hold It is beginning to resonate among potential Democratic presidential candidates as well John Edwards the North Carolina senator has begun lacing his speeches including a recent one in Iowa with references that echo former president Bill Clinton's 1992 message that he was for the people who played by the rules That was how Mr Clinton sidestepped the appearance of business-bashing when he ran for president in a climate of a weak economy and the savings and loan debacle He thereby preserved his New Democrat credentials and stayed a centrist course Ironically it is Al Gore whose populist corporation-thumping pitch during the 2000 elections angered many New Democrats who may gain most Should he choose to run again and emphasise a similar theme it is sure to revive the age-old debate within the Democratic party This all opens up some old wounds acknowledges one Senate Democrat I think Democrats have to be careful not to fall into a trap here because they have done a good job of building support particularly in our industry says Dave McCurdy a former Democratic congressman who is president of the Electronics Industry Alliance a high-tech group I hope they don't get carried away with the rhetoric  In many races the candidates are trying tarnish each other with allegations of having accepted money from some of the tainted corporations including Enron Tyco Global Crossing Adelphia and WorldCom But many corporations contribute to Democrats and Republicans alike so neither side can claim a monopoly on virtue In the 2000 election cycle for example WorldCom and its employees contributed about $1 8m more than two-thirds of it to Republicans who then controlled both the House and Senate Since then WorldCom's pattern of giving has shifted So far in this cycle some $816000 in donations has been split almost evenly between Democrats who took control of the Senate last year and Republicans As the contest between Mr Shows and Mr Pickering illustrates however it is the broad themes of corruption not the individual donations that are likely to make or break the outcome WorldCom meltdown Pages 22 and

2002-06-15, You would think that £8bn was a great deal of money to be lying around in half-forgotten accounts But that's exactly what has happened since the final surge of popularity and subsequent demise of the single company personal equity plan Pep The single company Pep offered investors the chance to boost the £6000 annual Pep allowance by a further £3000 a year The snag was that you could only put one company's shares in this part of your investment When new Peps were abolished in 1999 the replacement Isa individual savings account scheme did not offer any separate single company investment Instead from 2001 onwards existing Pep investors have been able to take advantage of the much more flexible rules governing Isas To help investors on their way Invesco Perpetual the biggest holder of Pep money in the UK recently said that it would no longer manage single company Peps Investors have until July 26 to decide on a new home for their cash or the firm will automatically move their money to a World Income fund or World Growth portfolio This depends on whether they currently receive dividend income or have the dividends reinvested Invesco says its move was prompted by a decision to concentrate on managing collective investments rather than single equities Fidelity the second-largest Pep holders scrapped single company Peps in April last year when the rules on Peps were relaxed to bring them more closely into line with the new Isa regulations Many people have single company Peps for privatisation shares or the proceeds from employee share schemes at work They are often not getting good value for money from their tax-free shelter as there is a holding fee for keeping the Pep going and you may be paying extra fees for collecting the tax credit quarterly statements and other extras that can soon add up As the tax credit on dividends is due to end altogether in 2004 you may end up paying out more in charges than you earn although the Pep still gives worthwhile protection against paying capital gains tax Tim Cockerill investment director at Chartwell Investment Management says the decision on whether to hold on to single company Peps depends on an investor's overall portfolio We have clients with £250000 in a portfolio so holding individual shares does make sense but for someone with £50000 we'd tend to suggest moving to a collective fund  If you want to keep your single company shares Invesco Perpetual Pep-holders and others should compare the offers from execution-only broking firms The choice is between those firms that charge a percentage of your Peps and possibly Isa funds as an annual fee or those that charge a flat fee Charles Schwab is aggressively courting ex-Invesco Perpetual customers with a £50 sweetener for signing up This only applies if you have funds worth more than £10000 Applications for this offer have to be in by July 5 for more information call 0870 606 6655 Schwab charges a minimum administration fee of £20 plus Vat up to £120 plus Vat Comdirect  www comdirect co uk  is one of the few brokers to charge flat-fee Pep administration Managing director John Glendinning says the flat-fee structure helps give the best value for both small and large portfolios Over the long term a percentage charging structure will make a big difference  The company has a Pep-charges calculator on its site so you can compare its charges with the deal from your current broker The Pep charge is £50 a year including Vat if you want to add your Isas these are cheaper at £25 a year It also offers cash incentives to help customers transferring from other Pep managers If you want an execution-only broker with the chance to upgrade your service to a discretionary or advisory portfolio Charles Stanley  www charlesstanley co uk  is not bargain-basement cheap but offers a network of local offices if you prefer face-to-face contact Execution-only Peps cost 0 75 per cent plus Vat annually on the first £10000 in value and 0 5 per cent on the next £40000 You can swap your single share holdings for other shares or funds but you can't put new money into the Pep Brokers will charge dealing fees for each new transaction for your Pep portfolio Alternatively you can give up on keeping your single company shares and switch to a funds supermarket these will allow you to transfer your Peps and Isas from previous years into your choice from hundreds of available funds Schwab has its own supermarket others are www fundsnetwork co uk www ample com and www bestinvest co uk ,1
2002-06-11, After 25 years at Fiat Group Paolo Cantarella last night walked out of its famous Lingotto headquarters for the last time as chief executive His departure from the Turin office block followed an unscheduled meeting with two of Italy's most powerful industrialists Giovanni Agnelli the 81-year-old patriarch for Fiat's controlling shareholders and group chairman Paolo Fresco were surprised by the chief executive's abrupt resignation But neither tried to talk him out of it Mr Agnelli issued a statement saying His decision pains me because I'm personally tied to Paolo Cantarella We worked together during the high points of the last 10 years and he was responsible for the relaunch of Fiat Auto after the difficult times as the beginning of the 1990s  In spite of that relaunch and subsequent attempts to transform Fiat Auto into a truly profitable carmaker the cash-hungry division continued to undermine the group Mr Cantarella managing director of Fiat Auto from 1990 to 1996 was closely associated with a car division dogged by excess capacity high fixed-costs and mounting price competition in its home market That culminated last year in a {XEU}549m $518m operating loss at Fiat Auto and further losses of {XEU}429m in the first quarter of this year Only two weeks ago Mr Cantarella told analysts In 2002 Fiat Auto should have an operating performance in line with 2001 which of course is absolutely not satisfactory  Yesterday he went further by admitting the need for a clean break Nevertheless his departure shocked senior management colleagues who last night hailed his engineering and management skills As an engineering graduate he was said to be one of the few Fiat directors who could walk the assembly line and immediately spot problems He was a complete petrolhead and had quite a temper but we all recognised he was the expert said one long-time colleague The Fiat chief executive liked to walk the floor at auto shows in the same way he inspected factories He thought nothing of checking the engines of rival models or opening and shutting doors to compare quality To some industry analysts however he paid the price for failing to apply such engineering skills to Fiat's balance sheet They also claimed his strategy failed to satisfy the credit ratings agencies whose downgrades contributed to Fiat's mounting borrowing costs or to bury rumours that Fiat sooner or later could be forced to sell its flagship division to General Motors  Union leaders representing more than 100000 European car workers at Fiat Auto and General Motors yesterday warned against a big bang takeover of the Italian carmaker by GM Senior officials from unions at GM Europe and Fiat expressed concern at mounting speculation that both companies could renegotiate their two-year-old alliance paving the way for GM to acquire outright control of its Italian partner ,2
2002-06-24, Investing in US mutual funds over the last two years has not been a smooth ride Market upheavals have left the average fund up just 0 7 per cent over three years according to fund tracker Morningstar In the search for investments that will perform in all market conditions investors are discovering market-neutral funds This is a mutual fund version of the long-short strategy devised by risk modelling pioneer Barr Rosenberg in 1989 to take advantage of price in- efficiencies The Axa Rosenberg Value Market Neutral fund with a 32 per cent return over the past year is the market-neutral heavyweight Axa's strict adherence to value investing cost the fund during the growth rally of the late 1990s It fell 12 per cent in 1999 But with the market's renewed focus on company fundamentals Will Jump Axa's director of global products strategy says the fund has come into its own The fund looks for companies that outperform relative to their peers within an industry says Mr Jump So it will perform best when company-specific valuation becomes more important than sector rotation  The market-neutral or long-short fund is a rare breed Since the Securities and Exchange Commission lifted the short-short rule barring mutual funds from short selling in 1997 few have embraced the strategy Standard & Poor's has only nine market-neutral mutual funds in its database The funds use a combination of long-term stock holdings and short-selling to try to cancel out many of the effects of the market leaving stock-picking as the main driver of returns The Rosenberg fund has notched up some impressive returns this way The average market-neutral fund is up 5 per cent in the year to date compared with the S&P 500's 10 per cent fall Over three years the funds have outpaced the S&P by an annualised 14 percentage points according to Standard & Poor's The $96m £66m Axa Rosenberg fund is one of three market-neutral portfolios totalling $400m in assets ,2
2002-06-28, World stock markets regained some of their composure yesterday as the effect of WorldCom proved less damaging than was first feared The European markets bounced back firmly most notably in Germany where technology stocks such as SAP Siemens and Infineon helped push the market up almost 2 per cent The US market which had closed barely changed on Wednesday after a rebound late in the day also opened in a stable state By midday however shaky sentiment had returned as early gains faded and stock indices tracked lower The S&P500 index the broadest measure of US blue-chip stocks was down 2 51 to 971 02 and the high-profile Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 31 01 to 9089 19 Jay Pelosky global strategist at Morgan Stanley said there was growing disillusionment in the US market from overseas investors which was evident from the reaction of world markets to WorldCom's disclosure of apparent fraud on Tuesday night While US markets recovered from their sharp losses world markets were hit hardest Global markets lost about $180bn in equity market capitalisation on Wednesday Mr Pelosky said WorldCom's effect has been dampened by the fact that shares have already been adjusted sharply downwards in recent weeks leaving less scope for further falls The S&P500 is just a few points above the lowest it plunged to last September in the wake of the terrorist attacks Analysts also pointed out that WorldCom's share price had already fallen massively before the latest news about accounting fraud down 99 per cent from its highs Its bonds were trading at 40 cents to the dollar before the disclosure However some cautioned that the WorldCom effect could rumble on Peter Oppenheimer global strategist at HSBC in London said The more companies that come under scrutiny the greater uncertainty there is about what else might come out of the woodwork  He said there was a growing problem of valuing companies If you can't trust the historic numbers let alone future earnings how can you calculate valuations He added that the risk premium investors demand for holding equities would continue to rise meaning that share prices have to continue to fall The final market lows will partly depend on how many more WorldComs we see and therefore on the equity risk premium But we doubt that the market will reach a final low until later this year  Mr Pelosky said that although the markets remained on shaky ground the outlook appeared more favourable in Europe because WorldCom was a US specific event and accounting irregularities are less likely in Europe Telecoms stocks remained among the worst performers on Wall Street with the ripple effects from WorldCom's accounting woes spreading to other companies that use earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation or ebitda as a key measure of financial performance There is clearly a backlash on broadcasting wireless telecoms and advertising companies These groups are getting hurt because they promote ebitda as their primary metric said Bryan Piskorowski market commentator at Prudential Securities Companies such as AOL Time Warner and Cablevision remained under pressure yesterday the former falling 2 4 per cent and the latter 14 per cent But General Motors' accounting practices also came under scrutiny yesterday as speculation about accounting irregularities briefly halted trading in its shares As one New York trader said Everyone is just waiting for the next shoe to drop ,2
1998-04-02, Asset values on which returns of privatised utilities are calculated have been cut by more than £11bn since 1994 as government and industry regulators have moved to curb prices and prevent excessive profits growth economists were told yesterday Directors of National Economic Research Associates told the Royal Economic Society's annual conference that the reduction in the regulatory asset base of private utilities had reduced their potential earnings and threatened to increase their cost of capital As a result investment was likely to become more expensive reducing the efficiency of companies on which customers and shareholders depended Graham Houston an associate director of the consultancy warned that investors were likely to feel further pain He said Regulators have flagged up the equivalent of a further £5 5bn reduction in asset values of private utilities when they conduct the next round of prices reviews  The pricing formula based on RPI minus X with X determined by the industry regulator is normally reviewed every five years Regulators consider what would be a fair rate of return when determining the size of the X factor They can also reduce potential earnings by writing down the asset values on which rates of return are based This happened in 1995 when Offer the electricity industry regulator wiped £2bn off the asset base of English and Welsh regional electricity companies Mr Houston said He added that Ofgas the gas industry regulator had cut a similar amount from the value of BG when it re-calculated shareholder investment in Transco the pipeline business of British Gas A further £5 2bn had effectively been removed from company values by the windfall tax announced last year National Economic Research Associates appealed for greater pricing certainty for investors and consumers who wanted a high quality of supply and low prices This required more consistency from regulators and government on pricing matters said the consultants Offer said yesterday When setting price limits it is important to maintain a balance between consistency and taking account of the experiences of previous price reviews In 1995 new information had emerged following a report by Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the director general of Offer concluded that tighter price controls were required  Claire Spottiswoode director general of Ofgas said Regulated businesses should earn additional profits from increased efficiency not by claiming a return on a book valuation of assets which are much larger than the sum of money shareholders actually paid The new price control on Transco guarantees a fair rate of return on the money shareholders invested ,3
2002-06-14, By warning yesterday that people should be careful about how much they borrow the Bank of England will have set home-buyers worrying about the cost of their mortgages The explosive growth in household borrowing especially mortgages has been fuelled by interest rates at a 38-year low But with house prices rising at their fastest rate since the 1980s boom consumer spending showing no clear signs of a slowdown and even manufacturing industry beginning to recover it is clear that rates are on their way up perhaps as soon as next month The important question for anyone borrowing now is how much higher rates are going to go By the standards of the past two decades rates are remarkably low The Bank's main interest rate at 4 per cent is less than half its average over that period A return to that level doubling the cost of mortgages would be catastrophic but seems unlikely The real interest rate allowing for the effect of inflation is a more useful yardstick and real rates are currently much closer to their 20-year average But even that measure may overstate the amount by which rates are likely to rise A better way to assess where rates are headed may be to look at neutral interest rates a level of rates that is neither stimulating nor depressing the economy The Bank of England has traditionally set little store by the analysis of neutral rates When Sir Edward George the Bank's governor was asked about it at yesterday's select committee hearing he accepted that rates were probably below their neutral level at the moment but said he was very doubtful about the use of the concept as a guide to policy With an armoury of sophisticated forecasting tools at their disposal the Bank's economists have tended to look down on what are generally rough and ready calculations of neutral rates But a working paper published last year by two Bank economists did accept that a version of the analysis has value as an inflation indicator And many City economists find the idea useful Geoffrey Dicks at Royal Bank of Scotland Financial Markets for example does some simple arithmetic If the neutral level of real interest rates is 2 5 per cent because that is approximately the long-term trend growth rate of the economy and the long-term average for inflation is expected to be 2 5 per cent as well because that is the government's target the neutral level for the Bank's main interest rate would be 5 per cent Other economists come up with very similar numbers To Mr Dicks' calculation many would add a risk premium to allow for the risk of a sharp surge in inflation or a steep fall in the pound But that extra premium may not now be very great You would normally have said that the neutral interest rate for Britain is around 6 per cent says Ben Broadbent of Goldman Sachs But the risk premium on sterling has been falling and now we would say it is more like 5 25 or 5 5 per cent  It appears that the adoption of an inflation target and the evolution of independence for the Bank of England through the 1990s has reduced the instability of the British economy So the level of interest rates required to keep it on an even keel is lower than it was a decade ago If rates do peak at between 5 and 5 5 per cent it would be a blow but not a disaster for most mortgage-payers A rise of roughly a third in debt-service costs would still leave the ratio of interest payments to incomes some way below its peak at the start of the 1990s But the longer the housing market and consumer spending stay strong the greater the risk that just as rates have been below neutral to offset the global slowdown they will have to rise above that level once the slowdown is over If the stability of the British economy is seriously upset say by a steep fall in the pound then rates might have to go considerably higher If that happened the pain for anyone borrowing now would be more severe As long as the strength of consumption does not set off inflation then the Bank does not have to hit the housing market very hard says Martin Weale of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research But if there is a serious inflation problem then there would be a much bigger threat to the housing market ,2
2002-06-27, Sportingbet com yesterday added ammunition to its claim of being the world's largest online sports betting company with the £4 5m acquisition of Sporting Odds the fixed odds business of Sporting Index the spread betting company The group also revealed that it had moved into profitability for the first time in its three-year history reporting full-year profits of £5m compared with losses of £4 2m Nigel Payne chief executive said the addition of Sporting Odds would help the company which derives most of its income from the US turn round its lossmaking European operations We are very optimistic about our profit streams in Europe because of this acquisition and expect Europe to be profitable by the end of the year  To fund the acquisition Sportingbet is issuing £2m of shares and using a £2 5m loan note While agreeing that the price was fair analysts said that the group still faced the problem of competing against existing brands such as Paddy Power William Hill and Ladbrokes This seems more like them wishing to be seen as a global sports brand said one Mr Payne said the group was not looking for further acquisitions but would instead concentrate on white label deals where Sportingbet transfers another company's website on to its platform taking on the running of the site for a percentage of profits Alongside its existing deals Mr Payne said the group had the capacity to take on 100 more companies There are lots of opportunities out there for white label deals and people almost always come to us We see it as part of the consolidation in the industry  Turnover in the year to March 31 more than trebled to £991 5m Both turnover and profit were helped by the acquisition of Sportsbook of the US in July 2001 which added 331000 customers bringing the total to 468500 The cash position also improved with the group reporting £9m of cash on its balance sheet and cash inflows of £17 2m Losses per share of 3 6p turned to profits of 3 4p There is no dividend The shares were unchanged at 95{1/2}p ,2
2002-06-08, Shares in Serco have halved over the last year The stock has been weighed down by concerns over accounting for private finance initiative and public private partnership projects In March the contract and facilities management group raised £120m through an institutional placing to strengthen its balance sheet The shares closed yesterday at 235p compared with 482{1/2}p a year ago They trade on a forward p/e of 24 times just above the sector average compared with 55 times at the start of this year The application of a directive from a UK Accounting Standards Board task force related to the treatment of bid costs would lead to Serco writing off only £1m In contrast the directive turned a 2001 underlying profit of £55m into a loss of £18 3m at rival Amey At the same time Serco's markets are expanding Not only are PFI and PPP expected to continue to be an important way of funding public sector projects in the UK but the US and European markets are also growing However it is unlikely that this long-term potential will be recognised until doubts about disclosure are removed Andrea Felsted,2

2002-06-14, General Motors is widelyexpected to overtake Ford Motor Company in an annual study of North American vehicle productivity for the first time The news will be another blow to Ford as it struggles to recover from poor sales and a series of management shake-ups The Harbour Report which is closely watched by Wall Street analysts and industry insiders is expected to show that GM the largest US automaker managed to cut the amount of time taken to produce vehicles at its North American plants Time taken to produce a vehicle is a key measure of the report which has been produced since 1989 Labour costs can be up to 12 per cent of manufacturing costs and is therefore an important element in Harbour's calculations David Bradley auto analyst at JP Morgan in New York said such a development would confirm GM's pre-eminence among the Big Three automakers including DaimlerChrysler in cost terms They've GM been lower in material costs for a while now it looks like they are getting lower on labour costs by getting lean manufacturing principles in their factories Among the Big Three they are certainly way ahead of the other two on many costs he said  GM has managed to eat away at its rivals' US market shares as a result of an aggressive incentives-driven sales push Earlier this month it added fresh incentives including generous cash-back payments on purchases to its product line-up It has also standardised and simplified its manufacturing process leading to cost savings Some observers have blamed previous top management at Ford for removing too many plant-level engineers and other staff who helped ensure Ford's dominance of the productivity rankings in the late 1980s and into the 1990s Bill Ford chairman is pushing through changes to the way his board reports on a company-wide turnround plan including tests to measure product quality and carrying out employee surveys The Harbour Report is also expected to show how foreign manufacturers are ranked Japanese producers have in recent years climbed steadily up the league table Last year the most efficient car or truck plant was one run by Nissan Earlier this month Ford reported a fall in May sales as it struggled to win back market share from US and foreign rivals GM also revealed a surprising drop in May US vehicle sales but revised upwards this year's earnings estimates on optimism about the full year ,2

2002-06-15, It is a simple enough idea Take the 100 largest quoted companies and combine them into an index to give an indication of the mood of the market But critics argue that benchmarks such as the FTSE 100 instead of being a useful guide to sentiment have become tyrants dictating the structure of the market Membership of the index conveys prestige on chief executives and forces many investors to buy the shares because of tracker funds The changing structure of the index also symbolises the constant evolution of the UK corporate sector This week's quarterly review was a case in point The technology sector all-conquering in 2000 was reduced to just one constituent Sage the accountancy software group ARM the chip designer and Logica the software group dropped out It was a far cry from March 2000 when technology stocks such as Baltimore Technologies surged into the index at a time when the group's annual turnover was just £23 3m Back then companies with the remote potential for profit were preferred by investors to long-established groups such as Whitbread and Associated British Foods Just as the March 2000 changes were seen as marking the peak of the technology bubble so this week's alterations may be seen as coinciding with the nadir for the technology sector The Techmark 100 index has fallen 84 per cent from its March 2000 high The software sector which commanded an historic price-earnings ratio of more than 100 at the peak now trades on a multiple of 24 Of course the 1999-2000 market was not just about technology The TMT technology media and telecoms sectors have gone up like a rocket and down like a stone Between the start of 1999 and March 2000 the TMT index rose 129 5 per cent Since then it has fallen 78 per cent The rest of the market has been far calmer rising just 5 8 per cent over the entire period Such volatility is the heart of one key argument against the tyranny of the benchmarks Active managers those who try to pick outperforming stocks argue that index-trackers represent dumb money Trackers are forced to buy stocks such as Baltimore when they enter the index often when they are trading at peak valuations only to sell them again when they drop out of the benchmark They are forced therefore to buy high and sell low And it is not just index-trackers that are prone to this problem Fund managers are judged by their ability to outperform the index so those who do not own a constituent may be taking a big risk Further international investors naturally look to the largest stocks as the basis for their exposure to the UK It is easy to see how index membership creates a lot of automatic demand from investors Construction of the index also has an enormous impact on the futures market Part of the rationale for establishing the FTSE 100 was to create a contract that could be traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange The old FT 30 was seen as too narrow an index just as in the US futures trading was concentrated on the S&P 500 index rather than the Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures traders look to arbitrage the market by selling the constituent stocks and buying the future or vice versa if prices get out of line And buying or selling the future gives institutional investors a quick way of adjusting their exposure to rising or falling markets So there is a lot riding on index membership Add in the natural issue of executive prestige managers can argue for bigger salaries if they are in charge of a FTSE 100 constituent and there is enormous incentive to get and stay in the index That can lead to some unusual price moves Back in March Logica saved itself from demotion by announcing two contracts on the day of the review The share price surged carrying the company up the market capitalisation table In September 2000 shares in Dimension Data surged 49 5 per cent on the day before its inclusion in the index So much depends on membership of the index that FTSE has twice had to change its rules to avoid potential distortions In 1998 it changed the way prices were calculated at the close of trading Before the changes small buy or sell orders had caused very sharp price movements in the last few minutes of business In 1997 JP Morgan the broker was fined £350000 after two of its traders were fired for allegedly trying to manipulate the index The FTSE accordingly shifted to a volume-weighted average based on the last 10 minutes of trading Last year FTSE changed its criteria to include only the free float the proportion of stock not owned by insiders in its market capitalisation Previously even companies with just 20 per cent of shares available for trading were given a full weight in the index Such companies could easily benefit from a squeeze in the market as index-trackers tried to build a full weighting despite the limited availability of stock But despite all the difficulties the FTSE 100 index is still perceived as the pre-eminent guide to the health of the UK market and to trends within UK industry Already the names of some of the original constituents of the FTSE 100 back at the start of 1984 are starting to take on the air of ancient history who remembers Imperial Continental Gas or Standard Telephone & Cables Of the original FTSE 100 constituents 30 survive under more or less their original name although some have gone down the initials route such as Guest Keen & Nettlefolds now GKN Others such as Hanson have been transformed beyond recognition Another 12 companies have survived in the FTSE 100 in altered form either through a merger with a foreign partner Reed Elsevier Reckitt Benckiser industry consolidation Commercial Union and General Accident are now part of CGNU Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance merged to form Royal & Sun Alliance or through a complete name change Six Continents Diageo Invensys and Hilton which have replaced original constituents Bass Grand Metropolitan BTR and Ladbroke A further 27 original constituents were acquired three went private British Home Stores MEPC and United Biscuits three were broken up Charterhouse J Rothschild Dalgety and Sears and two went bust British & Commonwealth and Ferranti The remainder are still around mostly in the FTSE 250 index although three S&W Berisford now Enodis Harrisons & Crosfield now Elementis and House of Fraser have drifted all the way down into the FTSE SmallCap Viewing the period as a whole the big changes have been the decline in importance of manufacturing and construction and the increasing concentration of the market Just four big sectors banks pharmaceuticals oils and telecommunications now dominate the market Briefly in 2000 Vodafone was worth more than 10 per cent of the index The only certainty is that the market will change substantially once more and that some of today's blue chips will one day seem as remote as Fine Spinners and Doublers or International Tea both original constituents of the FT 30 back in 1935 seem today ,2

2002-06-04, UniCredito Italiano Italy's second largest bank is today expected to agree to take part in the financial aid plan devised last week for Fiat in an effort to avoid the industrial group's debt being downgraded to junk bond status UniCredito's participation would not alter the plan but would spread the credit risk better among Italy's largest banks all of which have reached their lending limits with Fiat Banca Nazionale del Lavoro another creditor bank could also decide by the end of next week to participate in the plan drawn up by Sanpaolo IMI IntesaBci and Banca di Roma It looks like UniCredito will join but there is one final meeting Tuesday morning said a person familiar with the bank Fiat pledged to reduce its net debt to {XEU}3bn $2 8bn from {XEU}6 6bn and to sell as many assets as necessary If it fails banks could force Fiat to launch a rights issue that would allow them to convert a {XEU}3bn loan into stock giving them about one-quarter of Fiat's equity Bankers have said that the rights issue would be a last-ditch solution and that the possibility of a capital increase is meant to act as a cash guarantee on Fiat's debt thus stabilising its credit rating Ratings agencies are expected to decide over the next few days whether to downgrade Fiat's debt to junk bond status The threat of the downgrade came after Fiat reported a first quarter net loss of {XEU}529m and an operating loss at its Fiat Auto car division of {XEU}429m Analysts expect Fiat Auto to report a second quarter loss of between {XEU}300m and {XEU}400m because its European car sales down 20 per cent in the first quarter remain weak Fiat's European car sales fell by 20 per cent in April and analysts predict a similar slide for last month Italian car sales figures for May are due to be released tomorrow A parliamentary commission will begin hearings on Thursday on possible aid to the motor vehicle industry in Italy In addition Fiat's top executives will meet union leaders this week to review plans to cut 3000 jobs and temporarily lay off 10000 workers ,2
2002-06-24, Somewhere today a group of executives and officials from General Motors will hammer out a new initiative to cut costs and bureaucracy at the world's largest manufacturing corporation The day-long workshop in Detroit Frankfurt or any other GM location- may focus only on wiper-blades It may be consumed with tyre stocks showroom design healthcare benefits or staff appraisal But by this afternoon there should be an outline savings plan which will be measured at intervals of 30 60 and 90 days for signs of success Welcome to Go-Fast the GM management tool aimed at transforming a lumbering industry leviathan into the corporate equivalent of a sports car In 2001 the first full year of Go-Fast GM conducted about 3000 workshops In all about 35000 employees were urged to dump the old way of tackling problems becoming roadblock-busters in GM jargon The scheme has been co-ordinated by Don Ramelli president of GM University who was recruited from Allied Signal to overhaul GM's training and staff development Mr Ramelli says All the old habits are being flipped the intention is not just to be big but to be fast  Go-Fast is to GM what the work-out programme was to General Electric For GE and Jack Welch its legendary chairman the work-out was a useful mechanism to stimulate restructuring and margin improvement While acknowledging that GM would crave the growth and margins enjoyed by GE Mr Ramelli claims that outside companies are now looking at what we're doing One GM executive recently processed through Go-Fast explains We've been told it's all about reducing barriers to speed Each group is told to focus on a single business issue where there is too much bureaucracy  Workshop teams compete to come up with the best solution to a given problem In GM language the teams then debate their recommendations in a gallery of ideas A course of action is agreed on and presented to senior managers who authorise the changes and track their success Mr Ramelli claims the workshops contributed to an 11 per cent rise in product quality last year productivity in the US was up 8 5 per cent GM's share of the all-important US light truck market has risen four points to almost 32 per cent In the car industry however there is still plenty of scepticism about this sort of initiative Managers at some of GM's competitors are sceptical of measures packaged as out-of-the-box thinking or Accelerating Breakthrough Performance But GM appears to be achieving results from the scheme which has been taken up and encouraged by Rick Wagoner group chief executive After losing market share in North America for almost 30 years GM has begun to stabilise its near-28 per cent hold on the world's largest market It has begun to outperform Ford its arch-rival in productivity and quality Variable costs have fallen sharply excess capacity has been soaked up with strong-selling new models a restructuring is under way in Europe Gary Lapidus at Goldman Sachs in New York says The change in investor perceptions of GM is stunning One year ago the conventional wisdom was that GM's market share was in permanent free fall its normal earnings at best $5 a share and its organisation incapable of doing anything about it Today the market's view is that GM's earnings are more than $9 per share its era of market-share decline is over and its organisation is energised with a winning spirit that has unlocked long-dormant capabilities  While Goldman Sachs remains sceptical that such initiatives will outweigh GM's mountainous pension obligations or the drain of weak partners such as Fiat Auto of Italy it concedes that internal management has improved dramatically That view is shared at Morgan Stanley where David Bradley says We think the company is undergoing an important culture change moving from being a slow-moving and inwardly focused company to being a nimble and market-responsive company  Part of that change is the result of GM's recruitment of high-profile executives to bolster its management credibility and to convince existing officials that it could be turned round according to consultants who helped devise the Go-Fast programme Osvald Bjelland founder of Synecta the Anglo-Norwegian consultancy group that is part of GM's breakthrough consortium says the arrival of Bob Lutz former vice-chairman of Chrysler and John Devine Ford's former chief financial officer has added new momentum to the reforms being pushed through by Mr Wagoner as chief executive The knowledge flowing down from Lutz and Devine both brought in by Rick is all part of his strategy to make GM more outward-looking and innovative  Mr Wagoner who came up through GM's treasury department has in effect delegated new product responsibility to Mr Lutz an acclaimed design and engineering guru while encouraging Mr Devine to bear down on costs and extract maximum synergies from GM's far-flung alliance partners Having such top-management experience is one thing but industry analysts and GM insiders admit that its value would be undermined without a coherent mechanism to implement it That according to Mr Ramelli is where Go-Fast comes in Rick has set his targets and his view is 'If we could be fast and gain leverage from our size imagine how powerful we could be '  Partly as a result of Go-Fast initiatives GM has increased the pace of new product launches to one every 27 days It's a pace of launches we would never have been able to sustain in previous times says the former Allied Signal executive Recommendations from Go-Fast workshops are also said to have reduced purchasing costs and lowered inventories If we improve factory run-rates by a couple of percentage points it's a big saving adds Mr Ramelli On material costs every penny you take out is a penny to the bottom line  Most of the suggestions and ideas flowing out of Go-Fast workshops may not be realised for several months or even years In some areas proposed changes may be subject to union agreement in others they have to be approved by leadership panels responsible for implementing strategy Mr Ramelli also concedes that it is easier to engage salaried mostly white-collar staff in such internal reforms than hourly paid unionised assembly workers Union contracts and old working practices also make it easier to roll out Go-Fast initiatives in some parts of the world than in others Europe took off even faster than a lot of parts of the US and it fed into a lot of the things you see in Project Olympia says Mr Ramelli Project Olympia is the grandiose title of GM's European restructuring designed to cut production capacity by 400000 units and to reduce losses by more than half to $350m £240m this year Executives say the management style from the workshops is helping to change processes both in administration and on the factory floor The architect of Go-Fast maintains that such improvements are just a start We have not had full convergence on all our processes yet But the trend is clear the management wants to move faster and will not let size get in the way of changing GM  Ford sees signs of turning the corner Page 29,2
2002-04-04, Alpha Airports the aviation services group fell into the red last year after passenger numbers collapsed in the wake of September 11 However Kevin Abbott chief executive said passenger numbers were beginning to show signs of recovery and he did not expect to have to take further exceptional charges The shares which fell to 43{1/2}p after September 11 rose 5p to 68{1/2}p In the year to January 31 restructuring with the loss of 923 jobs contributed to exceptional charges of £23 1m These included a £9 1m goodwill impairment charge on Alpha's Gatwick kitchen bought from British Airways in 1999 for £14m Pre-tax losses were £6 9m £5 9m profit on turnover of £431m £433m Alpha which provides 48m airline meals a year in the UK is 27 per cent owned by Servair the flight catering arm of Air France which bought its stake two years ago Under new FRS 17 accounting rules Alpha revealed a pension scheme deficit of £8m 16 per cent of liabilities Mr Abbott said the scheme remained open to middle and senior management and a decision would be taken shortly on contributions Rodney Galpin chairman will be retiring in May and will be replaced by Graham Frost formerly chief executive of Argos The proposed final dividend is increased to 2 6p 2 4p making a total of 3 6p 3 4p Mr Abbott said the rise in the pay-out reflected the growth in underlying profitability Losses per share were 8 15p 0 29p Andy Murphy analyst at WestLB Panmure the company's broker said he was raising his profit forecast before goodwill and exceptionals for the year to January 2003 from £21 1m to £23 1m because of the improvement in trading and benefits from cost-cutting Comment  Alpha has no quoted competitors and even in the private sector is a little fish compared to larger global companies such as LSG SkyChefs and Gate Gourmet Global uncertainties mean the air industry remains vulnerable and Alpha's specific weaknesses the unfunded pension deficit and low level of balance sheet reserves do little to reassure nervous flyers but on a p/e of 8 the shares do not yet seem to be factoring in a recovery ,2
2002-04-12, The Treasury could raise £4bn from stealth taxes on high earners by tinkering with allowances and national insurance thresholds leading accountants predicted yesterday Limiting the tax-free personal allowance currently £4535 to apply only to the lower rate would raise £2bn alone in next week's Budget the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said Aligning the upper limit for national insurance contributions with the higher rate tax band could yield another £2bn helping Gordon Brown towards the £5bn-plus extra taxes he is estimated to need Ian Hayes chairman of the tax faculty said the scope for stealth taxes was far lower this year than in previous years because so many hidden taxes had already been introduced But more than £1500 could be raised from each higher-rate taxpayer through the two measures alone It is a way you can see revenue being collected from high earners without actually increasing the top rate of tax Mr Hayes said He said he had heard a few whispers that the Treasury was considering limiting the personal allowance to the lower rate of tax which would cost high earners £800 a year each The move would be likely to be accompanied by a shake-up in the personal allowance to give each person a fixed tax relief of £900-£1000 he said The institute said Mr Brown could raise £8bn of extra tax by pumping up the national insurance rate from 10 to 11 per cent Mr Hayes forecast stamp duty on property could rise from 4 to 5 per cent VAT could rise to 18 or 19 per cent from 17 5 per cent now The Treasury refused to comment before the Budget ,3

2002-04-22, Shell is easy to take for granted It has been around for so long its bigmerger creating the Royal Dutch/Shell group out of the Royal Dutch Petroleum company and Shell Trading and Transport was in 1907 It has one of the world's most famous brands the yellow and red shell Yet it often seems like just part of the landscape like the United Nations 140 of whose members host Shell companies But Shell is on the move In recent months it has done deals that make it the largest petrol retailer in Germany and the US and the world leader in lubricants It is reviving its strategic alliance with Gazprom of Russia as part of a worldwide mega-bet on gas And it is set to swallow up the UK's biggest independent Enterprise Oil by the end of this month It would be enormously helpful if people when they observe Shell would ask how does this or that jigsaw piece fit into the overall puzzle Phil Watts the chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell says of the public bemusement surrounding some of these acquisitions You'll find they the acquisitions are part of a grand plan  One of the reasons why people find Shell hard to read is that by long and hallowed tradition it does not have an up-front chief executive to lay down the law in the way that Lee Raymond does at ExxonMobil and John Browne does at BP Instead it has a five-man committee drawn from the two parent companies which Mr Watts chairs Giving his first big interview since taking over from Sir Mark Moody-Stuart as chairman nearly 10 months ago Mr Watts is unapologetic about his relatively low public profile For years I have been convinced that what business doesn't need is a kind of hero-leader or personality cult says Mr Watts who was born in Leicestershire 56 years ago I'm called chairman of the committee of the managing directors of the Royal Dutch/ Shell group what a mouthful but I'm just primus inter pares  Does he feel constrained by other committee members No I'm the leader of a strong team and enjoy it  Does he need restraining He almost answers yes I believe good robust discussion in a team leads to better decisions  One discussion he does not find helpful is about whether Shell's bi-national structure with headquarters in the Hague and London makes sense any longer and whether Shell should use the new European company statute to turn itself into a single company better able to offer shares in payment for acquisitions The Dutch side of Shell is known to oppose any such welding of the two halves of Shell into one All Mr Watts will say is that current arrangements have served us well particularly since the 1996 changes that ended Shell's regional fiefdoms and reorganised it on clear business lines with clear business responsibilities Questions of any further reorganisation are just not at the forefront of my mind Mr Watts says adding firmly that we have business to do That business is to build on Shell's recovery from 1998 when it wrote off $5bn of bad assets and set itself a four-year road map to sell off 40 per cent of its ailing chemical assets reduce costs by $5bn and get returns on capital employed up to 14 per cent judged on a $14 oil price As head of exploration and production E&P Mr Watts was key to this 1998-2001 recovery But once achieved it left observers wondering what was next Mr Watts outlined his answer in new strategic goals set last December They reflect his enthusiasm for the upstream side of the business my first love which he feels pays the best returns We want more E&P and more gas and power with a predilection for gas over oil We still want to profitably grow oil products and chemicals while adding at least one new income stream whether software services floating liquefied natural gas terminals or gas to liquids  Shell's means to achieve this are considerable a planned capital expenditure of $12bn £8 3bn a year But so are its projects Mr Watts lists heavy oil in Canada gas projects in Russia gas fields and the west-east pipeline in China two new LNG units in Nigeria participation in Saudi Arabia's gas initiative LNG in Iran and gas to liquids schemes in Qatar and Iran These come into Mr Watts' category of big new things that make a difference to a company the size of Shell He says there is no guarantee that all these projects will work In investing in members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries we would be doing the economically sensible thing in making major investments where the technical cost is lowest But he counsels patience with political sensitivities in the Middle East This is why Shell has to have a bunch of projects across the world to maintain its momentum In fact there is a bit of an LNG glut with several Shell projects in Asia competing against each other for scarce Japanese and Korean demand But the Shell chairman refuses to concede that his pursuit of LNG in Asia and the Atlantic market is risky even though for the first time Shell is having to be its own LNG customer by promising to take 3m-4m tonnes a year from its Nigerian plant OK these are big bets but Shell's a big company we do this for a living  On this scale Shell's £3 5bn bid for Enterprise Oil the largest remaining independent in the UK looks modest even though Shell must be overpaying in light of the new UK oil profits surcharge But Enterprise fits into the Shell jigsaw because its weighting to oil offsets Shell's overall bias to gas and because Mr Watts sees it as a good buy at higher oil prices Enterprise fills a gap in our portfolio of E&P in royalty tax regimes that look particularly good at higher oil prices The other reason for snapping up a pure upstream company such as Enterprise is to counter a series of opportunist purchases DEA petrol stations in Germany Texaco refining and marketing in the US Pennzoil lubricants in the US that risked tilting Shell more to the downstream than Mr Watts wanted He defends the opportunism You can set priorities one to 10 but then number three comes up first If you don't take it    number three goes for ever  But one issue on which the Shell chairman is inflexible is sustainable development the portmanteau phrase for corporate responsibility in the economic environmental and social fields It is important that your business principles remain constant wherever you operate says Mr Watts whose concern for setting and upholding standards in the developing world dates from two years teaching in Sierra Leone in between his BSc in physics and MSc in geophysics at Leeds university Shell wore its social conscience on its corporate sleeve before Mr Watts' arrival in the top job and the retired Sir Mark Moody-Stuart has become the Group of Eight's prime mover of renewable energy But Mr Watts's second lengthy job title is chairman of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development composed of 160 progressive companies around the globe In that guise he will take to the world development summit in Johannesburg this summer the message that the real challenge is putting sustainability into normal business In Shell's case normal business is $12bn a sum far outweighing any money spent on philanthropy Mr Watts also bangs the drum for Shell's policy of diversity in recruitment Diversity helps to give us competitive advantage in terms of relationships in 140 countries and different ways of thinking  He is equally firm on the business case for sustainable development in all fields If you want me to prove every dollar and every cent on all of these lines I can't do it he says But directionally I think it's an open and shut case ,1
2002-06-10, HSBC may be a global contender as a financial services company but it has long punched below its weight in fund management Alain Dromer hired last year to run HSBC's fund management operation knows this and he wants to put it right We were a little like still water he says as he pours a glass of mineral water at HSBC Asset Management's headquarters in the City of London Now we want to be a little more sparkling  HSBC is certainly ambitious It wants to triple assets under management currently at £138bn over the next five years Achieving that as markets continue to fall will not be easy But Mr Dromer an animated Frenchmen who formerly ran Credit Commercial de France's fund management business before HSBC acquired the French bank is optimistic Recalling the moment he took charge of the business he says I was fascinated by the size of the group its international reach and its culture of being global and local at the same time  He trots out facts from a briefing paper prepared for analysts HSBC has a strong presence in Europe Asia and Latin America its fund managers are unusually located in 13 offices round the globe in HSBC's banking division it has a ready-made distribution channel for its products This is nothing new so why the confidence that HSBC can break with tradition and make it as a big-time fund management house Mr Dromer points to HSBC's new resolution to position itself as a strategic player in the wealth management industry This he says is founded on the belief that fund management is a growth market with a difference If there was growth but the market shares of fund managers were rigid or allocated already then this would be unattractive to us But there is all to play for  Beyond this are HSBC's expansion plans in Asia Europe and the US He wants to build what he calls HSBC's number one market Hong Kong and greater China HSBC's historic oriental links have been obscured by its vague acronymic name But Mr Dromer intends trading on its roots as the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation It already has a link with China Southern Fund Management Mr Dromer says HSBC is ready to take advantage of new laws to be introduced this year that would allow foreign fund managers to take a 33 per cent stake in local investment houses Elsewhere in Asia HSBC last year bought a controlling stake in CSIT one of Taiwan's top fund managers and it is preparing to enter India which has great potential as a source of new investors Mr Dromer says there is an application with the regulators for HSBC to be recognised as an official onshore fund manager based in Mumbai In Europe HSBC is strong in the UK where it is listed and in France where thanks to the CCF acquisition it controls a 3 5 per cent market share But it plans to grow in Italy Spain Switzerland Scandinavia and especially Germany The place that we have the strongest foothold outside the UK and France is Germany he says That's because of HSBC's German subsidiary HSBC Trinkhaus & Burkhardt Its funds under management about $25bn are not counted in HSBC's $138bn total because its asset management business is for the time being quite separate Are there plans to put them together We are talking yes he says cautiously Overnight it would boost HSBC's funds under management by 18 per cent In the US HSBC faces its toughest challenge Of its position in the world's biggest equity market he says Frankly we are not strong in US large-cap fund management We have to improve our credibility in this area Our performance is not satisfactory  We want to we have to grow the business he says and not only because HSBC is failing to reach US investors European Japanese Chinese investors they are looking for global portfolios and you need to have a very good capability in the US if you want to satisfy their demand  This sounds as if he is building towards a statement about HSBC's grand plans for an acquisition But Mr Dromer chooses his words carefully An acquisition could be a solution but the fit culturally and technically must be good and there are not many players out there  A more likely option is a hiring spree We already have very good people and we want to beef this up  As well as expanding geographically Mr Dromer is drawing up plans for an expansion of HSBC's product range Top of the agenda is a new company focusing on alternative investments and in particular hedge funds HSBC Asset Management is ordered in three strands a core global active fund management business handling £125bn of assets specialist companies running $13bn of assets and a multi-manager funds operation In its specialist division it plans to create HSBC Alternative Investments to spearhead its attack on the hedge fund market HSBC has just three hedge funds although it has a large fund of hedge funds business operated by HSBC Republic But isn't it a bit late to be entering the hedge fund business No he says There will be a lot of Darwinian selection because not everything in the hedge fund industry is of superb quality We will have a place consistent with our brand and profile  If as Mr Dromer says HSBC can take its rightful place among the world's big fund managers that would be a long overdue achievement But HSBC's struggle to break into the top tier suggests he should not put the sparkling water let alone the bubbly on ice just yet ,2
2002-04-18, Kabul is in the hands of a clique of Tajik warlords who seized the city with the support of a major western power to get rid of a rogue Afghan regime A power vacuum across central Asia created in the wake of the collapse of Moscow's empire threatens to suck the superpowers into another Great Game Afghanistan's neighbours fight proxy wars with each other inside the country backing rival tribal leaders And the west's last hope for peace is a man with a claim to the Afghan throne living in exile This description fits today's situation in Afghanistan as the country prepares for the return of Zahir Shah the former king after a 29-year exile in Rome But it could easily describe the arrival of Nadir Khan Zahir Shah's father in Kabul in 1929 when the British-backed leader deposed Bacha-i-Saqao a Tajik commander who had entrenched himself in Kabul also with British help The lesson of Afghan history is simple according to Abdul Baqi Hesari a silver-bearded professor of history at Kabul University whatever western statesmen wish to do to bring peace to Afghanistan everything has already been tried he says Zahir Shah is coming the same way his father did His father was supported by the British Zahir Shah is supported by the Americans The foreigners always think they can solve Afghanistan's problems by backing someone new  The issue is no longer whether history will repeat itself but rather what periods of Afghan history will be repeated By supporting the king western governments are clearly hoping for a repeat of the conditions that prevailed during Zahir Shah's 40-year rule After he took over from his father who was murdered in 1933 the king presided over a stable if not overly prosperous time for Afghanistan Others are less optimistic Many see ominous parallels with 1992 when attempts to dislodge another Tajik-dominated government that of president Buhannudin Rabbani tipped the country into a decade of civil war The continuing violence in Afghanistan has raised questions about the interim administration's grip on power It has also underlined the volatility of a country torn apart by decades of war US-led anti-terrorist coali tion forces and this week the British marines have been fighting what increasingly appears to be a guerrilla war against the remnants of al- Qaeda and Taliban units Isaf the United Nations-backed peacekeeping effort in Kabul has been targeted by rocket attacks and snipers Rival warlords in Afghanistan's provinces clash almost daily Human Rights Watch has documented hundreds of cases of abuses against ethnic Pashtuns in the north of Afghanistan dominated by Uzbeks Hazaras and Tajiks Western leaders are convinced the answer to civil strife is broad-based democratic government in Kabul This in turn depends on persuading the Northern Alliance which seized Kabul in November to share power It also means convincing the majority Pashtun tribesmen who form up to 65 per cent of Afghanistan's population but have low representation in the new government to accept a compromise Western statesmen and the king's Afghan supporters are hoping the former king's grandfather-of- the-nation status will help unite ethnic groups under a single national banner While insisting he is returning to be a simple citizen the ailing 87-year-old Zahir Shah will be an important political figure His tribe the Muhammadzais used a shrewd policy of intermarriage among Afghanistan's tribes virtually to erase ethnic differences from the country during his rule He is still widely thought of as the only neutral figure of his stature in Afghanistan Under the terms of the Bonn peace agreement negotiated last December the king will chair the loya jirga  a 1450-member tribal council to be convened in June which will choose a new head of state and cabinet for the next 18 months There is even some talk that the jirga will choose the king as the symbolic head of state Certainly the king does not rule out the possibility of one day regaining his throne which he lost in 1973 to a putsch by his cousin Daoud Whatever duties the people of Afghanistan wish to bestow upon me I shall accept It is entirely in their hands he said recently But the king's Rome Group already faces growing pressure from the Northern Alliance which fears the king will attempt to erode its dominant position in Kabul Abdul Rasul Sayyaf a powerful Northern Alliance leader says of the king Nobody is loyal to him He is an old man he does not have the ability to move from place to place There is no interest among the people in his leadership Some people are simply using his name for their own interests  In many provinces there have been clashes between warlords who profess loyalty to the king and those who say they owe allegiance to the Northern Alliance Pashtun provinces in the south fly the king's green red and black colours at virtually every street corner In northern provinces by contrast pictures of Northern Alliance commanders are ubiquitous The Pashtuns who formed the backbone of the Taliban have split into warring groups since the movement's defeat But they could unite again in the blink of an eye according to Mr Hesari Pir Seyd Gailani a Pashtun who heads the Peshawar group one of the four main factions that negotiated the Bonn agreement agrees If the Pashtuns see they have been ignored by the government definitely they will react I am not saying they will join al-Qaeda maybe they will make a new movement Al-Qaeda was not popular It is not the issue The issue is the Pashtun reaction  Afghanistan's complicated international situation adds to the problem Russia and Iran which backed the Northern Alliance against the Taliban still see the northerners as an important lever of influence in Afghanistan and are loath to see them lose their power All this presents a daunting challenge for Zahir Shah Even his courageous commitment to rebuilding Afghanistan may be insufficient to prevent the more tragic periods of Afghan history repeating themselves ,3
2002-06-06, Cape the building materials group that has been fighting asbestos-related injury claims from South African miners announced more than doubled full-year losses after a conditional settlement with the sufferers The group which reached a conditional out-of-court settlement in December with 7500 South Africans suffering from asbestos-related diseases announced pre-tax losses of £32 4m £15m for the year to December 31 after an exceptional charge of £31 9m £15 7m The charge was made up of £13 5m for the claimants less a release of provisions for future legal fees and an £18 4m write-down in the value of the manufacturing assets Operating profits before the exceptionals were reduced to £10 8m £11m from increased turnover of £267m £239m Cape said it would soon be telling shareholders of progress in financing the settlement but acknowledged that industrial disease claims may continue to be lodged in the UK in the foreseeable future The board believed future settlements could be made from future cashflow but said that if this were not the case the group's financial position could be damaged Paul Sellars chairman said the intention was now to reorganise the group fundamentally A separate quotation is to be obtained for the industrial services division which turned in operating profits of £11m for the year and the manufacturing division has been put up for for sale to generate the cash needed to settle the litigation and eliminate the indebtedness to the banks When details of the conditional settlement were released the claimants' lawyers were cited as saying their clients could have won considerably more if the case had gone to trial but it seemed clear that Cape's financial position is that it would go into liquidation if it lost the trial Under the proposed settlement Cape would pay £21m into a trust fund in South Africa that would make payments to victims of asbestos- related diseases caused by working at or living near to Cape operations Some £11m is to be paid by June 30 The conditional settlement relieved Cape of the cost of cleaning up land used in the operations The shares which were suspended at the company's request on May 1 resumed trading yesterday at 20{1/2}p-1p up on the price before trading was suspended and rose 10 per cent to close at 22{1/2}p ,2
2002-04-15, The Football League has threatened to demand the disclosure of sensitive internal documents written by executives at Carlton Communications and Granada at the time of their joint venture's bid for rights to matches This action part of the league's claim for more than £500m from the two television companies would be triggered if ITV Digital is put into liquidation this week The league wants to know how much directors of the ITV Digital parent companies knew about the bidding for the media rights in 2000 It would use the pre-action discovery measure to shed light on the level of backing that the two companies gave to ITV Digital's bid ITV Digital won the rights with a bid of £315m Carlton and Granada have since denied they are liable for payments to the league because adequate parent company guarantees were not secured The league is owed £178 5m for the remaining two years of the contract ITV Digital has offered £62m All parties to the dispute will be in the High Court today when Nick Dargan of Deloitte & Touche the ITV Digital administrator will update a judge on the progress of his dialogue with the league Representatives of the league thought to include David Buchler the insolvency expert last night held talks with Mr Dargan If Mr Dargan today reports that a settlement with the league is possible he is likely to request funding from Granada and Carlton to keep ITV Digital running for the next few days However if he is unable to report positive news the business is likely to be liquidated and court proceedings are likely by the league It also emerged last night that the league was considering dragging the rest of the ITV Network including Scottish Media Group into the dispute The whole network supported the ITV Digital bid for the rights The next few days will be crucial in determining the fate of ITV Digital People close to the dispute agree it is unlikely that screens will go blank this week Whether a negotiated settlement is possible will be known by Thursday when the league's 72 chairmen gather in Manchester They will be given a choice of supporting the position taken by David Burns the league's chief executive and Keith Harris its chairman or accepting a lower offer from ITV Digital www ft com/media,1

2002-06-27, The equity bull market ended more than two years ago But now it seems that bull market psychology is unravelling fast The WorldCom accounting scandal is an arrow at the heart of one of the standard bull market assumptions that the US was the paragon of the world's financial markets with the most dynamic economy the most innovative companies and the highest accounting standards Overseas investors were happy to fund the US's substantial current account deficit because they wanted to have a stake in the great US boom But they must now feel rather as emerging market investors did in the mid-1990s that they were suckers in a game rigged in favour of insiders In Asia the blame fell on cronyism and a banking system that allowed overinvestment in unprofitable projects in the US the blame is falling on corporate executives who have taken excessive risks and distorted accounts in pursuit of lucrative share options The disillusionment with the US has spread to the dollar which yesterday slipped to within an ace of parity with the euro It has also revived the fortunes of gold which moved back above $320 an ounce yesterday During the 1990s gold seemed to have been supplanted by the dollar as the safe asset of choice but now investors are rediscovering the virtues of the yellow metal Retail investors also seem to be losing faith in the cult of the equity that they embraced so wholeheartedly in the 1990s In the US and the UK investors seem once again to be looking to property as the most reliable nest-egg while in Europe those investors who bought privatisations such as France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are sitting on heavy losses A recent survey by UBS Warburg found European retail investors were expecting equity returns of just 6 7 per cent over the next 12 months Of course it is possible that the current plunge in shares represents the kind of climactic sell-off that often marks the bottom of a bear market Equity markets have drifted back to the lows last seen after September's terrorist attacks on the US which were followed by a rapid and substantial recovery We think the sell-off is very likely the bottom for the most recent collapse in share prices this side of the Atlantic because the fall had already been running out of steam They say that the bottom is reached at the darkest hour The WorldCom event certainly counts as pretty damn dark and we feel more than dark enough for us to ring the bell say analysts at UK stockbroker Charles Stanley But these are dangerous times not least because of the way that the global economy and financial system had adapted to the long bull market There is leverage built into the system not as extreme as the gearing that brought down Long-Term Capital Management the US hedge fund in 1998 but just as dangerous for being so widespread That leverage shows up most obviously in the US corporate sector where companies that had geared up their balance sheets during the boom years are now caught in the vice of falling revenues and the constant need to meet interest payments But the leverage is all around Life assurance companies for example buy financial assets in order to keep their promises to pay out on death or on the termination of policies Regulators insist on resilience tests to ensure that the insurers have sufficient assets to fulfil those promises As equity markets fall these tests can force insurers to sell equities and buy less volatile bonds That can force markets into a death spiral as falling prices oblige insurers to sell equities which pushes share prices down further forcing more sales of shares To avoid this problem the UK and Irish resilience tests were relaxed after September 11 But there are fears that the recent falls in markets have revived the problem There has been talk this month that European insurance companies have been forced sellers of equities while last week UK bank Abbey National paid £150m to bolster the finances of its life assurance arm Scottish Mutual UK insurance companies were quick to say yesterday that they would not be forced to sell equities and buy bonds because of the WorldCom news But there are fears that the crunch point may not be far below current market levels General insurers also represent a source of leverage for the system Traditionally they have lost money on their underwriting operations money they have made up through investment returns But as those returns have fallen insurers have been forced to push up premiums increasing the costs of the corporate sector Furthermore insurance companies form a significant proportion of the stock market as worries about their finances increase their share prices decline putting further downward pressure on the market The same problem applies to banks which have exposure to falling markets via their trading activities and which have also seen a decline in their income from corporate finance activities such as mergers and acquisitions The fortunes of the banks and insurance companies may be tied together in another way Banks have made much of their ability to avoid bad debt problems by securitising debt converting it into tradable form which they can sell on to outside investors But the risks have been dissipated not eliminated Someone will lose out from Enron and WorldCom and many suspect the insurance industry will be the fall guy The full damage may yet be revealed Then there is the pension industry Companies that have promised final-salary-based pensions are dependent on stock market returns to meet their promises In effect they have written a put option on the stock market As markets fall they may be forced to put in more cash thereby reducing profits None of these risks by themselves may be enough to cause disaster But the past decade in Japan has shown what can happen if equity markets fall far enough to weaken the position of the financial sector The loss of confidence in US assets if sustained also has some significant economic implications The US needs an inflow of more than $1bn a day to fund its current account deficit In a way the US has also been making a leveraged bet borrowing money from abroad in the belief that it can invest that capital at a high return If investors are unwilling to fund that deficit by buying US assets at current prices one of three things may occur the US will have to cut back sharply its spending on imports hitting world trade the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates to attract foreign deposits slowing the US economy or the dollar will have to fall far enough for US assets to look attractive once more That would pile deflationary pressures on to Europe and Asia The worst may not happen however It is quite easy to picture a scenario where most of the above problems disappear If the global economy continues to recover corporate profits will steadily recover That may restore investor confidence in US equities and may cause them to dismiss Enron and WorldCom as the inevitable catastrophes that emerge at the end of a bull market Equity markets may then recover releasing the pressure on insurance companies The leverage in the system could then work in the market's favour allowing investors to switch from bonds to equities But even a recovery will not leave the markets or the economy unchanged Regulators are already moving to tighten control of the accounting and investment banking sector Companies will not operate in the same freewheeling environment that they enjoyed in the 1990s And it will be a long while before investors regain the bullish spirit they had just two-and-a-bit years ago ,2
2002-06-01, A flurry of strong economic figures from the US helped the dollar regain its footing yesterday The Chicago Purchasing Management Index rose to 60 8 in May from 54 9 in April Meanwhile revised data showed first quarter non-farm productivity rising 8 4 per cent down slightly from the previous estimate but still the fastest rise since 1983 Finally the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index surpassed expectations The data has provided a convenient excuse for some profit taking before the long weekend in London said Paul Chertkow head of currency strategy at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi The dollar was also assisted by a fresh round of intervention by the Bank of Japan  The patience of the Japanese authorities appeared to be paying off yesterday Many wondered why Bank of Japan was absent from the foreign exchange market on Thursday when the dollar lurched below Y123 There was a sense that the Japanese authorities had been waiting for speculative traders to bet heavily against the dollar before stepping into the market This meant that traders were forced to unravel long dollar positions in a hurry increasing the effect of the Japanese intervention There was also a sense that the Bank of Japan had used more firepower for this round of intervention with estimates ranging up to around $5bn In spite of its success the Bank of Japan was considered likely to intervene again early in the week to take advantage of thin liquidity arising from the long weekend in the UK Mr Chertkow said the Japanese authorities appeared keen to push the dollar back above Y125 5  The dollar's weakness has been having a mixed effect on emerging market currencies Recently it has been the mirror image of the period in which the dollar was rising Currencies like the rand which suffered most from the dollar's rise are finding their feet Yesterday the rand continued to push higher against the dollar reaching R9 75 In contrast the main beneficiary of the dollar's strength the Mexican peso has been having a hard time It was one of the few currencies to outpace the dollar at times during its long bull run A perception that Mexico was becoming the 53nd state of the US led to a surge of foreign direct investment into the country said John Davitte head of emerging market research at IDEAglobal in London Last year the short euro/ long Mexican peso was the one of the favourite trades  Now the peso is falling faster than the dollar which started April at 9 pesos and is now trading at 9 68 ,2

2002-04-05, Lot Polish Airlines is set to join the Star Alliance the largest global airline group after signing a co-operation agreement with Germany's Lufthansa yesterday The two airlines agreed to begin code-sharing on June 1 on all their flights between Poland and Germany Lot's biggest European market As part of the deal Lufthansa will also help Lot adapt to Star's standards and systems in preparation for alliance membership next year Jurgen Weber chairman of Lufthansa said that the deal represented an important step toward Lot's Star Alliance membership Lot's choice of the Star Alliance will come as a blow to British Airways which had lobbied Lot to join its Oneworld alliance Plans by BA and American Airlines its main partner to build up Oneworld were thrown into turmoil when US regulators demanded a high price for antitrust immunity forcing them to withdraw their application The other similar international alliances including Star and Sky Team led by Air France and Delta Air Lines have secured US antitrust immunity This allows airlines operating over the Atlantic the world's busiest international travel market to effectively merge their operations The deal is a boost for Poland's flag carrier which suffered a setback last year after its former alliance partner and shareholder Swissair which still owns a 25 1 per cent stake collapsed Swiss the successor to Lot's bankrupt former partner is in talks with Oneworld after signing a deal with American Airlines last week The Polish state which owns 68 per cent of Lot was forced to recapitalise the airline late last year following the sharp drop in traffic on its lucrative transatlantic routes after the September 11 terrorist attacks Yesterday's agreement will not affect Swissair's stake in Lot the fate of which depends on the administrator who is handling the bankrupt group's affairs The fact that we are applying to join the Star Alliance doesn't determine our ownership structure said Wieslaw Kaczmarek state treasury minister But it will help the Swissair syndicate in the process of finding an investor  The Polish government still plans a future public flotation of Lot's shares Mr Kaczmarek said but only after its shareholder structure became clear Lufthansa's chairman said the airline had offered to help Lot if necessary but that it had no immediate plans to invest ,1
2002-04-25, Goodyear the world's biggest tyremaker yesterday reported a worse-than-expected first-quarter loss of $63 2m blaming production cuts currency problems and returned inventory arising from the closure of a big US distribution chain The loss equivalent to 39 cents a share compares with analysts' forecasts of 30-35 cents and a loss of $46 7m or 30 cents in the year-ago quarter However Goodyear's shares rose 3 6 per cent to $23 52 in early New York trading after the company predicted a return to profitability to between 5 and 10 cents a share in the second quarter Sam Gibara chairman and chief executive said that while disappointed by the loss we expect to make progress in the second quarter Most analysts' second-quarter estimates have ranged between break-even and about 20 cents a share The biggest operating loss of $51 3m was incurred by the North American tyre operations The company remained profitable in Europe although operating profits fell sharply to $16 6m from $31 4m Profitability improved slightly in Asia Goodyear has been hit hard by the closure of the Penske Automotive Centre distribution chain The return of inventory accounted for a $10m charge equivalent to 4 cents a share The overall loss came despite increased supplies of original-equipment tyres to major carmakers Goodyear's predictions of an improved second-quarter performance are based partly on its belief that US distributors will increase orders after a pricing controversy in the first quarter Goodyear lost market share early this year when it imposed price increases that met stiff resistance from distributors and retailers Since then however rivals have raised their prices to match ,2
2002-06-17, Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse has long been regarded as the home of the gnomes of Zurich the secretive money managers whose financial power used to move the world's foreign exchange markets But the Bahn- hofstrasse is no longer the first port of call for international investors seeking Switzerland's smartest money managers Geneva Switzerland's other main financial centre where Bernie Cornfeld the fund manager who served 11 months in a Swiss prison in the early 1970s for charges relating to his infamous Investors Overseas Services fund of funds empire still attracts some of the more adventurous managers But up-and-coming Swiss fund managers are now more likely to be found tucked away in relatively unknown Swiss towns such as Pfaffikon Zug and Nyon Until Rainer-Marc Frey 39 a former Salomon bond trader sold his RMF fund management business to the UK's Man Group for $833m last month few outside the global hedge fund industry had heard of RMF let alone Pfaffikon a small town on Lake Zurich where Frey had assembled one of Europe's biggest fund of hedge fund operations The price paid for a business with just $8 5bn of funds under management looks steep when compared with the $750m that Swiss Bank Corporation paid for Gary Brinson's $35bn traditional US fund management business or UBS's $675m acquisition of the late Gilbert de Botton's $13 9bn Gam fund management empire But RMF which has been doubling its funds under management for the past six years has been much more profitable and faster-growing than traditional fund management rivals RMF is one of the best known of a group of Swiss fund managers ranging from private banks such as Geneva's UBP to alternative investment boutiques such as Nyon's EIM that have sprung up to balance the explosion in Swiss demand for hedge funds with a limited supply of top hedge fund managers Switzerland is the capital of the offshore private banking industry with an estimated 30 per cent of internationally invested private assets worldwide under management Its clientele principally rich individuals have been driving global demand for hedge funds which is why Switzerland is number two in the hedge fund business after the US As pension funds diversify into hedge funds competition for access to quality managers is intensifying The disparity in performance among hedge funds is substantially larger than traditional funds so the difference and therefore risk between winners and losers is enormous says James Breiding managing director of Naissance an alternative investment manager Pascal Botteron author of a recent report on Swiss hedge fund investing by Arthur Andersen the financial consultancy says Swiss banks and financial intermediaries account for $100bn-$130bn of the world's $500bn hedge fund industry According to the Swiss National Bank profits of Switzerland's 369 banks fell 36 per cent last year and funds under management the life-blood of most Swiss banks dropped 8 5 per cent to SFr3400bn $2180 Hence Swiss private banks have been scrambling to offer clients access to hedge funds the one part of the industry enjoying double digit growth rates The Andersen study showed that the number of visits made by private banks to hedge fund operators rose 52 per cent last year Mr Frey says the hedge fund industry can grow by at least 25 per cent a year over the next decade If hedge funds represent 2 per cent of global liquid assets raising the penetration rate to 8 to 9 per cent makes this a fascinating business he says The ability of Credit Suisse Private Banking CSPB to boost its funds under management by 2 8 per cent last year as rival Julius Baer suffered a 11 per cent drop had a lot to do with CSPB's aggressive push to offer hedge fund products to its private banking clients The fact that CSPB Switzerland's second largest private bank felt it worthwhile to outsource its hedge fund business to RMF says a lot about the industry RMF does not manage hedge funds itself It manages the hedge fund managers promising clients a bespoke investment exposure to alternative assets through specialised products With their mystique of low volatility lack of correlation to traditional asset classes and high returns hedge funds have become the darling of today's investors Mr Botteron says But many of the best hedge fund managers refuse to take on more money from new investors who are forced to turn to untested hedge fund managers In an unregulated market with little transparency there is a premium on financial specialists that can guarantee a stringent and effective selection process for new hedge fund managers As pension funds become more interested in hedge funds the selection process will become even more important says Philipp Hildebrand head of UBP's alternative investment operation Switzerland's growing expertise in this positions it to capitalise on this latest love affair with hedge funds Investing in Hedge Funds Available at www arthurandersen ch,2

2002-06-28, Property funds are growing in popularity As an alternative to traditional investment classes such as equities and bonds property funds allow investors to tap into the exponential growth of the real estate market without having to go to the trouble of finding purchasing and managing the property themselves Property funds come in all shapes and sizes and invest in real estate property company's shares or a mixture of the two Previously these vehicles invested across a broad spectrum of property diversified by sector as well as by geography Now property funds are becoming increasingly focused reflecting the growing specialisation of real estate companies It is not uncommon for a fund to invest solely in out-of-town retail developments or suburban offices and there has been a plethora of specialist funds recently launched on the market such as Credit Suisse Asset Management's InterSwiss fund investing in Swiss offices Close Venture Management's enterprise investment scheme investing in care homes and ProLogis' industrial warehouse fund There is no real consensus on which specialist areas of property would make good investments Victor van Bommel real estate equity analyst at Goldman Sachs sees good opportunities in European excluding the UK retail the Paris office market and specialist developments such as Canary Wharf Wimbledon based IFA Interalliance believes care homes and regionally specific commercial property will generate solid growth in the mid to long term while La Salle Investment management favours Southern European retail logistics in France Benelux Spain and Italy and the French market generally Over the past year specialist funds have seen good performance Standard & Poor's data for offshore property funds shows that Morgan Stanley's European excluding UK property fund and Activest's US-Reits funds posted the greatest returns in the year to June 10 2002 growing 16 2 and 14 49 per cent respectively This compares to 12 54 and 12 41 per cent for AXA's and Morgan Stanley's European Property fund the best performing generalist funds Specialist funds have delivered excellent returns But not all property investments can deliver such growth and the risk of downside volatility is high Some industry experts question the validity of specialisation Charlie Ansdell communications director of Interalliance says The problem with investing solely in specialist funds is that there is no diversification you are relying on the market outperforming There is also the risk if the sector does well of over-saturations  Patrick Connolly associate director at Chartwell Investments agrees If you are considering diversifying your portfolio by investing in property you need to do so through diversified property portfolios  Nick Tyrell director at Deutsche Bank Real Estate says On the issue of specialisation it's my impression that 'we're specialists' translates into 'we're not big enough to cover the whole geographic or asset spectrum competently so we'll just cover some of it' That's OK but it effectively means they abdicate the ability to manage risk properly and to seek the highest risk-adjusted returns to their clients  But for others specialist property funds can be put to good use Frank Blaschka a Principal at US-based real estate consultant The Townsend Group says although there may be considerable risks in specialist funds these can be offset by the higher returns they typically seek and by the fact that allocations to specialist funds are smaller than those to generalist funds He says So when you look at the overall portfolio a commitment of even $25m to such a fund often has a minimal impact on diversification parameters and overall risk profile at least when the client's overall portfolio is say $500m in size  Specialist funds can therefore be an extremely useful investment tool when used in conjunction with a generalist fund as part of a core/ satellite approach Asset Managers create a core portfolio of generalist real estate funds designed to generate stable returns without being too risky To push up returns a number of specialist satellite funds will be built around the generalist funds If chosen well the specialist satellite funds will outperform the core portfolio by a considerable margin In this way investors have the security of placing the large majority of their assets in a well-diversified generalist property fund with some specialist funds to kick-start better overall returns Core/satellite strategies are undoubtedly a good solution to the risk/return problem of specialist real estate funds But other than for the ultra-rich or institutional investors this approach is out of most investors' price range Minimum investment starts at millions of dollars With many areas of real estate investment requiring long-term allocations of at least 5-10 years sometimes longer to generate returns this strategy is only suitable for those institutional investors prepared to tie up their money for that long ,2
2002-06-28, Standard Life was the main beneficiary of the flight to quality that marked the UK life assurance sector last year following the crisis at Equitable Life its biggest mutual competitor The Edinburgh-based group last year increased its UK new premium income by 76 per cent to £6 3bn a figure that astonished analysts However even Europe's biggest mutual life assurer was not immune to the pressures on its sector not least the plunging stock market According to Standard Life's latest statutory returns its free assets those in excess of liabilities had fallen from £8 6bn at the end of the 2001 financial year to £3 4bn at the end of last year Standard Life does not use implicit items such as future profits in its regulatory returns However it has historically used the freedom afforded by the strength of its capital base to invest heavily in equities which it believes will give a better return over the long term At the end of March Standard Life had 78 per cent of its assets in equities very high by industry standards The sheer quantity of new business being written by Standard Life will also have involved costs However it said that this so-called new business strain was much reduced because the group no longer offered a guaranteed return on its with-profits policies and acquisition costs have also fallen with lower commission rates This month Standard Life said it would raise £1bn in the bond market to fund growth and help bolster its solvency position John Hylands Standard Life's finance director said raising capital this way was cost-effective and denied it was a sign of financial weakness He acknowledged however that its capital position had suffered because of declining equity markets Mr Hylands said Standard Life's financial position was not in doubt since the ratings agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's had both reaffirmed its triple A status Last year two of Standard Life's biggest quoted competitors also tapped the bond market with CGNU raising £1bn in August and Prudential £500m in November Policyholders also benefited from Standard Life's financial strength during the with-profits bonus season in February when it announced the lowest cuts in endowment policies' maturity pay-outs at 8 per cent of any big life company Andrew Bolger,2
2002-06-25, The venture capital world knows all about too much money chasing too few opportunities Now the hedge fund world could be taught the same lesson In the late 1990s investors sent billions of dollars after the huge returns offered by venture capital Then the market collapsed under its own weight Venture capital groups ploughed their super-abundant funds into useless internet companies which they foisted where possible on a gullible public Fortunately or unfortunately depending on whether you were one of the people blowing the bubble or one of those with gum on their face venture capitalists did not manage to move all their worthless inventory As a result venture capital returns plunged 27 8 per cent last year according to Thomson Financial's Venture Economics Venture capital funds are now starting to return part of the $100bn they have raised but have no idea how to invest The internet bubble analogy has been over-used in the hedge fund world There are definite signs that some hedge fund investors are over-enthusiastic but there are no imminent signs of a catastrophic blow-up In one area however the venture capital analogy may be apt Incubation is the hedge world's true version of venture capital In this business hedge fund backers such as Blackstone Alternative Asset Management Framework Investment Group Larch Lane Advisors or Reservoir Capital develop young up-and-coming hedge funds Usually they take an equity stake in the management company and invest capital in the funds themselves Hedge funds' reason for giving up equity in their firms and therefore a share of what can be lucrative fees is that the young funds are helped to set up a fully functional business Hedge funds commonly charge 2 per cent of assets and 20 per cent of fees That fee structure can generate hundreds of millions of dollars of income for the most successful manager But very few managers are consistently successful Most people now say that running a successful hedge fund requires getting right both the investing and the business side Ken Griffin at Citadel Investment is commonly held up as the best example of a manager who not only generates consistently impressive returns but has also created a money management institution By contrast Tiger Management and Soros Fund Management are cited as examples of what can happen to great investors who do not get a good hold on the business side Of course George Soros and Julian Robertston were hedge fund pioneers Those that followed had the luxury of learning from their mistakes in trying to help truly sizeable hedge fund operations grow Incubators' job is to put in place the key administrative staff the chief operating officer general counsel or head of human resources for example who are necessary for any stand-alone business to grow and prosper Often incubators also help their young charges with risk management systems and expertise and in developing funding relationships with Wall Street If the hedge fund incubation model works the economics can be far more attractive than most venture capital deals Not only do the incubators benefit from a growing share of management fees but they usually also benefit from their own investment in the fund which is often left to compound over several years Nor is the downside as stark for incubators as it is for venture capital If a hedge fund fails an incubator might lose its position in the management fee but it will usually pay for that with services And it probably will not lose all its investment in the hedge fund itself That will probably be pulled out long before the value of the fund goes to zero Those are the reasons why hedge fund incubation can be a great business The current drawbacks are supply and demand There are now more incubators than ever before one professional who raises money for hedge funds says he has a list of 43 fighting over roughly the same amount of talent To make matters worse the barriers to entry in the hedge fund world are lower than they ever have been Last year saw record inflows into the the hedge fund industry Tass Research says more than $30bn flowed into hedge funds The Hennessee Group put the figure including some capital appreciation at around $140bn Either way investors and Wall Street prime brokers are crying out for new hedge funds As a result credible new hedge fund managers can name their price Increasingly those in the incubation business say that price is more than they are prepared to pay Andrew Gitlin chief executive officer of the newly launched Framework Investment Group expects most of his new incubation business to be done in Europe because that market has been far less exploited Like most business cycles this one will eventually change In the meantime incubators might want to tighten their belts ,2
2002-04-15, The rot set in quickly last year While that may be a less than compelling argument for most investments it serves as a strong buy signal for the most expensive white wine in the world Sauternes En primeur 2001 Sauternes will go on sale after the producers set their prices probably by the end of this month The Chateau Doisy-Daene was the first off the block on Friday with a wholesale price of £160 $227 a case for its sweet white wine Retail buyers can expect to pay an additional 20 per cent Although buyers of these wine futures will not know for certain what exactly they have paid for until the wine is bottled towards the end of this year and delivered in the spring of 2004 early indications are that the vintage is of a kind not seen in decades It is absolutely fantastic said Simon Staples sales director at London wine merchants Berry Brothers & Rudd He visited Bordeaux last week to test the vintage the product of what he describes as a perfect harvest The botrytis fungus source of the precious pourriture noble or noble rot struck last year just when the Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes had reached the perfect level of ripeness The result the experts say is an exceptionally rich and fragrant vintage These wines are 10 out of 10 said Mr Staples I haven't tasted anything like them in my 15 years of en primeur tastings There's a good chance that this could be the best Sauternes vintage of all time  His top recommendations are the Chateaux Rieussec Suduiraut and Lafaurie Peyraguey all of which he expects to sell for about £300 and £375 a case or roughly 20 per cent more than their 2000 en primeur prices He is also keen on the Doisy Vedrines and the lesser-known Chateau de Rayne Vigneau both of which should represent bargains at about £200 a case At the other end of the scale is the famed and expensive Chateau d'Yquem almost impossible to buy en primeur  which is likely to command a particularly high price for this vintage They are all extraordinary said Mr Staples If you can find them buy them  Philip Moulin who works with Mr Staples said that while most en primeur prices would not be decided until the critic Robert Parker weighed in with his verdict on the vintage in The Wine Advocate the early indications were that 2001 Sauternes might be remarkably good value priced lower than their quality justified by producers that were eager to gain some market share from the red wines The outlook is murkier for the red Bordeaux At Farr Vintners the leading London wine merchant tasters just back from the region describe 2001 as a very good vintage better than 1999 1998 in the Medoc and 1997 It is comparable in quality with mature vintages such as 1988 1986 1985 and 1983 they say and is probably as good as 1996 Justin Christoph manager of the auction division of Morrell & Company in New York suggests that while some of the top 2001 wines are as good as the 2000 vintage and many nearly as good it is unlikely they will cost anywhere near as much The producers need to win back all the people who were turned off by last year's prices he said While the vintage and of course the date were extraordinary there is a perception among merchants and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic that they may have paid too much At Farr Vintners they are telling clients that 2001 is a vintage to buy en primeur only if it is priced at least 20 per cent lower than 2000 and only if the wines are half the price or less of comparable mature vintages That means spending no more than £400 a case for Pichon Lalande and £1300 for Latour said Tom Hudson at the firm's London office Mick Swain at Sam's Wines & Spirits in Chicago the leading merchant in the Midwest says that he has received a fraction of the en primeur inquires from customers he received last year a situation he does not expect to change unless the prices are a lot lower At present he is recommending the 2001 Lafite Rothschild the Latours Pauillac and the Leoville Las Cases St Julien depending on the prices Aspiring collectors making their first forays into the en primeur market should bear two points in mind First buyers must order and pay for the wine immediately but will not be able to take delivery until two years later at which time several other charges including sales tax will be due Second the quality and particularly the staying power of wine that is only six months old is very difficult to ascertain Advantages of en primeur buying are that it enables collectors to obtain rare wines that are often otherwise unavailable and that wines can be ordered in special sizes say half bottles of Sauternes and magnums of red Wine merchants recommend a carefully structured approach to maximise the prospects of healthy investment returns and minimise risk This starts with the creation of a diversified portfolio of wines across a broad price range Fine Bordeaux will generally appreciate in value sometimes very substantially On average said Mr Moulin at Berry Brothers & Rudd buyers of a range of en primeur wines over a 10-year period should realise a 10 per cent annual gain on their investment Among the 2001 wines the Sauternes and a few of the obvious reds seem a fairly sure bet But buyers of other en primeur wines this year should look closely at both the reviews and the prices to avoid a re-run of 1997 an indifferent year that succeeded a good year but was priced at the same level ,2

2002-06-05, Hewlett-Packard yesterday said accelerated job cuts and greater procurement economies would enable it to save more money more quickly than projected when it took over rival Compaq Computer for $19bn last month The computer and printer maker told a gathering of financial analysts that it expected to achieve $3bn £2bn in cost savings by the 2004 financial year following the Compaq merger HP previously said it would cut costs by $2 5bn although it had described that target as a high confidence number suggesting the actual cost savings would be greater Carly Fiorina chief executive said We are moving faster and achieving more  The gathering marked the first time HP had met Wall Street analysts since launching the combined company one month ago Views of the merger which were mixed during the months leading up to the deal's close have become more positive in recent weeks and analysts have begun to upgrade HP's stock They were encouraged by the prospect of the company meeting or exceeding its cost-saving targets The company also said yesterday that it expected to save $500m by the end of October the close of HP's 2002 financial year and $2 5bn in the following twelve months HP said greater procurement synergies would enable the company to reach higher savings targets while faster than anticipated job cuts meant the group could reduce costs ahead of schedule It expected to cut 10000 jobs by the end of the 2002 financial year and another 5000 in the following year about 10 per cent of the workforce of the newly enlarged corporation Some 4000 job cuts would come as a result of the early retirement package being offered to some US employees Ms Fiorina said additional cuts would be appropriate should market conditions continue to deteriorate but the current round of job cuts was about right Bob Wayman chief financial officer said that while visibility remained very poor the company expected to report revenues of $35bn to $36bn in the last two quarters of this year down from pro forma $37 8bn which the two companies reported in the second half of last year He also forecast revenue would increase 4 per cent to 6 per cent in 2003 and 7 per cent to 9 per cent in 2004 Hitachi defends IBM deal Page 26 www ft com/infotech,1
2002-04-03, The man who has presided over Enterprise since its formation was yesterday notably absent from the announcement of its sale While officially out of the country and unavailable for comment colleagues said Sir Graham Hearne Enterprise chairman had been choked by the emotion of the occasion Sir Graham originally a lawyer who had also headed Courtaulds became Enter-prise's first chief executive in 1983 when the group was spun out of the former state-owned British Gas Working from a single room at Kleinwort Benson's offices he oversaw the group's float in 1984 and subsequently helped build its production from 30000 barrels of oil a day to almost 300000 barrels He really won't be happy at the outcome today Enterprise was his company said a former colleague Sir Graham 64 is well known in the City for his charismatic approach and legendary networking skills He holds a string of non-executive positions including directorships of Rothschilds Novar and Invensys and is not expected to slow down following his departure from Enterprise Sir Graham's early achievements included successful bid defences against Rio Tinto and Elf But he hit a low point when he tried a hostile bid for Lasmo in 1994 Launching the offer he declared the oil industry was a big boys' game implying that Lasmo would not succeed on its own The approach went down badly with Lasmo's management and was seized on by the press who thought it especially amusing given Sir Graham's short stature In 1998 he tried a friendly approach to Lasmo but the baggage of the earlier offer led to that too failing over a personality clash Analysts reckon this was the turning point for Enterprise After a difficult few years in which the company experienced production problems his relationship with Pierre Jungels who became chief executive of Enterprise in 1996 was increasingly the source of speculation Insiders say Sir Graham and the more technocratic Mr Jungels were different personalities who never became personally close and found it increasingly difficult to work together Mr Jungels left abruptly in October to be replaced by Sam Laidlaw who had caught Sir Graham's eye as a future leader of the company before the appointment of Mr Jungels The relationship with Mr Laidlaw had been going better but analysts said the group ultimately failed to take Sir Graham's own advice and took too long to join the ranks of big boys ,2
2002-06-05, The race is on Since the beginning of the year fund managers banks insurers and financial service providers have been touting their wares in what experts expect to be one of Europe's most lucrative private pensions markets The prize is a share of a savings market that is estimated to be worth between {XEU}20bn and {XEU}40bn by 2008 as Germany sets out to support a creaking pay-as-you-earn retirement system with privately funded schemes Under plans piloted through parliament by German labour minister Walter Riester last year Germans are being encouraged by subsidies and incentives to supplement their state benefits with a personal or company pension plan The move the first time in post war Germany that part of the responsibility for pension provision has been shifted from the state back to the individual is aimed at bolstering an overstretched state system that is unable to bear the strain of a rapidly greying population But experts say the reform is a cautious first step The incentives are just not significant enough says one money manager To break five decades of reliance on social security will take more than this  In the true tradition of German over engineering legislators have ensured that the pension schemes are complex and expensive to produce Far too complex in some eyes Riester is a very important step forward according to Joachim Faber an Allianz board member But it also has a lot of deficiencies  He believes the Riester schemes are too bureaucratic and too costly to administer for providers The system is so complicated that it deters participation he says Pension experts admit that the response to Riester is below most expectations It is estimated that only about 2m people have so far taken out Riester schemes But the lukewarm reception so far has not stopped the financial services industry from jostling for a share of the spoils Riester after all is expected to be just the first tentative step in what economists believe will be a paradigm shift in German social policy Analysts say the companies that stand to benefit the most in the early stages of the reform are the local insurance companies They have an existing competence in occupational pensions and the necessary financial muscle says Pedtro Matthynssens a partner at Capco the financial services consultancy The new pension products also show an insurance bias The schemes require insurance style guarantees on invested capital level load commissions for the policyholder and a payout as an annuity Credit Suisse First Boston analysts say Germany's biggest insurer Allianz is likely to benefit the most from the new business It is already the market leader in Riester products having sold about 450000 contracts so far Allianz's strength is its distribution power where most of the profits can be earned say analysts Since taking over Dresdner Bank Germany's third biggest bank last year Allianz has been able to offer the full spectrum of distribution channels 800 bank branches 15000 tied agents and 400 financial planners It is also well placed to win group scheme customers with Allianz Dresdner Pension Consult a sales force and consultancy specialising in company pensions likely to form the biggest part of the new market Last year it won the contract to manage an occupational scheme for the country's biggest industrial sector the engineering industry Allianz is also addressing its old fashioned product line quickly developing more modern unit linked policies and strengthening its asset management business with the acquisition of DIT Germany's fourth largest fund group as part of the Dresdner deal But some of Allianz's rivals have been quicker off the mark AMB Germany's second biggest life insurer was the first big German insurer to hit the market with unit linked policies It is the market leader with a 30 per cent share of the market The group controlled by Generali the Italian insurer has gained market share largely because of its distribution power It has 11000 tied agents a bank link up with Commerzbank Germany's fourth largest a fast growing direct brand called Cosmos and a long standing relationship with DVAG the largest financial adviser network in Germany Munich Re like Allianz has been slow to develop unit linked products But it too has moved quickly to fill the gap The reinsurer controls Ergo Germany's second biggest primary insurer and its 17000 tied agents It has also strengthened its distribution power by taking a 26 per cent stake in HVB Group the country's second biggest bank and set up an advisory company for corporate pensions Credit Suisse believes the one outsider that stands to gain is Zurich Financial Services the Swiss insurer which acquired Deutscher Herold from Deutsche Bank last year Herold is ranked second in the German unit linked pensions market ZFS also took control of Deutsche's Bonnfinanz sales force Apart from the insurers the financial adviser networks are also likely to benefit from the pension reforms largely because of their sheer complexity Individuals with a basic aversion to small print are expected to turn to the listed adviser networks AWD MLP and Tecis for help Banks too will benefit from the pensions hype although most analysts assume they will come third in the race in terms of reaping profits from this new business However Germany's big banks are leading players in the mutual fund business and offer the distribution machines that are now in demand ,2
2002-06-12, Citigroup the largest US banking company and one of the biggest foreign banks in Asia shook up its management yesterday in response to big losses in the Argentine financial crisis The group is to dismantle its emerging markets business and shift Victor Menezes its head to a more strategic role Deryck Maughan a vice chairman will become head of Citigroup International overseeing the company's five main international regions including many of the countries that formerly reported to Mr Menezes The revamp marks the latest in a series of attempts by Sandy Weill Citigroup's chairman and chief executive to foster a more entrepreneurial culture in the company Its top product executives Bob Willumstad consumer finance Michael Carpenter investment and corporate banking and Tom Jones investment management will be given global responsibilities Managers overseeing product lines will be given more power working in partnership with country managers who will spot opportunities and monitor profitability The Argentine crisis knocked a total of $1 3bn off the company's pre-tax earnings in the last two quarters Mr Menezes said in April that the crisis went beyond the dangers anticipated by Citigroup's risk models It having a separate emerging markets division separated it too much from the rest of the company said Mr Weill who added that as a result some things fell between the cracks Mr Weill signalled his concerns about emerging markets in February when he named Chuck Prince chief operating officer of the company to serve as chief operating officer of emerging markets as well reporting to Mr Menezes Mr Prince has frequently played the role of trouble-shooter for Mr Weill Chuck was helpful in getting a lot of people involved in the process Mr Weill said I think we have strengthened our ability over the last three or four months to have a more proactive ongoing all-the-time looking-forward approach to the changing risk situation  Mr Menezes is the last veteran of Citicorp which merged with Mr Weill's Travelers in 1998 to continue in a senior operational role His new responsibilities remain important since he will slide into Mr Maughan's former role overseeing acquisitions a role of great importance to Mr Weill who is a keen dealmaker Mr Prince will take on responsibility for finance risk management and human resources ,1

2002-06-24, European construction The Europeans and the Americans have got the builders in Infrastructure programmes and buoyant housing markets on both sides of the Atlantic have underpinned a strong performance by European construction and building materials stocks Over the past 18 months the two sectors have outperformed the Eurotop 300 by about 80 and 45 per cent respectively Can this continue or is it time for investors to leave the building Interest rates are still low and look unlikely to rise significantly in the medium term The backlog of transport infrastructure spending has still to be cleared The industry's strong cash flow and solid asset backing look attractive to investors still recovering from the melt-down of TMT stocks The sector also continues to consolidate although current transactions look less risky than the big international deals of the recent past Lafarge and RMC struggled to absorb Blue Circle Industries and Rugby The present trend is for domestic deals ACS has taken a 23 5 per cent stake in Dragados and sold off Hollandsche Beton or for bolt-on acquisitions The consistency of the industry's recent performance has persuaded some optimists that it has become less cyclical though this theory is unlikely to withstand even a modest downturn Another cloud on the horizon is the shift in US government budget priorities from civil infrastructure to homeland defence But although much of the sector's good fortune has been factored into share prices prospects remain good ,2
2002-06-04, Like Sherlock Holmes' dog that did not bark the silence emerging from the mezzanine financing market is a mystery The last couple of years should have been the golden age of mezzanine financing but the market has been almost inactive Mezzanine is designed to step in to buy-out deals where traditional debt financing fails When the bank loan and high-yield markets are all but closed mezzanine financiers should theoretically move in with their tailored mix of debt and equity warrants to make struggling deals work Companies such as Blackstone Group Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank which have large mezzanine units should have had an opportunity to make hay in recent years after the technology and telecommunications markets melted down and the bank loan and high-yield markets were further pummelled by a recession No such luck The monster $1bn-plus mezzanine funds struggled to find anything to invest in even though according to figures from Standard & Poor's Portfolio Management Data contributions to buy-out funds have increased steadily from only 7 per cent in 1987 to over 40 per cent in 2001 and 2002 Those figures indicate that banks have become less willing to lend money to help complete buy-out transactions over the last decade relying instead on the contributions from buy-out firms' own funds At the same time as equity was increasing PMD's figures show debt leverage on buy-out deals relative to cash flow or more specifically earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation falling steadily Multiples fell from an average of 8 8 times in 1987 to 3 6 times last year Nor was it just that trend that favoured mezzanine Mezzanine's natural competitors bank lenders and Wall Street high-yield teams have either shrunk or disappeared as foreigners reassessed the opportunities offered by the US loan market and securities firms merged in a consolidation frenzy Why then have the mezzanine lenders had so little to do It is partly because the buy-out firms had so little to do The last year has a seen a deal drought in the buy-out market A recent presentation from the private equity firm Berenson Minella on the state of the mezzanine market noted that only $19 7bn worth of deals being completed last year compared with $40bn in 2000 Other data providers put last year's figure even lower Finally a series of big buy-out deals have been floated in recent months including Qwest's sale of its yellow pages business Diageo's sale of Burger King and the multi-billion buy-out of Jefferson Smurfit Part of the reason for the increase in deals is that the bank and high-yield markets are opening up but the good news for the mezzanine is that banks and investors new-found generosity only extends so far They are still not particularly keen to fund middle-sized deals Blackstone sees new mezzanine deal flow coming from three sources You really don't see it in the results yet but activity has picked up profoundly said Howard Gellis who runs the firm's mezzanine group The firm is seeing an increase of refinancing activity where companies use a new layer of mezzanine financing to reduce their bank debt keeping anxious banks happy and reducing the company's financing costs Blackstone is also increasing trying to get public companies to use mezzanine as an alternative to PIPEs or private investments in public enterprises which are often the last refuge of the truly desperate in the financing world Finally Blackstone sees signs of improvement in the traditional buy-out business US companies ought to have been just as interested last year in refinancing or finding alternatives to PIPEs but Mr Gellis said that it has taken time for them to be won over There are still some reasons to be sceptical that the mezzanine business will enjoy a spectacular bounce back For one thing many buy-out deals have been floated but half way through the year precious few have been completed Equally worrying there's a lot of unused mezzanine money around According to a recent presentation by private equity firm Berenson Minella LBO firms have raised more than $150bn over the last three years while mezzanine funds have raised $15bn That big imbalance might suggest that mezzanine firms are in far better shape than the buy-out funds who now have around $120bn they are seeking to put to work but mezzanine deals tend to be far smaller than buy-out deals But maybe the biggest challenge comes from the fact that most investors now expect both private and public equity returns to come down In an environment where buy-out firms are fighting to keep their margins above the equity markets what hope is there for the piggy in the middle,2
2002-04-24, The tax rises announced in last week's budget will put the brakes on consumer demand and slow pay growth the Bank of England said yesterday stoking speculation that any interest rate rise may yet be some way off Mervyn King the UK central bank's deputy governor told business leaders that it was too early to say whether a recovery from last year's global economic slowdown had taken hold Speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce conference in London he said that while business confidence had improved investment had yet to pick up The recent news has been encouraging It is still too soon though to be confident that recovery is entrenched There is clearly a risk the recovery we've seen so far has been based on a response to the inventories rundown last year  Rapid growth in consumer spending of 4 per cent a year since 1997 was unlikely to last Indeed the extra taxes imposed last week will reduce consumer spending in order to release resources to provide for better public services he said The decision by Gordon Brown chancellor of the exchequer to raise taxes in order to boost the state-run health service would lead to slower growth in take-home pay he said That is simply the price of better public services Real incomes need not fall but for a short time simply grow more slowly than otherwise  Mr King's remarks were the first public speech by a Bank official since the annual budget Economists said his uncertainty over the strength of the manufacturing recovery coupled with emphasis that demand must slow pointed to an interest rate rise later in the year in July or August The deputy governor said it was extremely difficult to predict the direction of interest rates which the Bank's rate-setting monetary policy committee has held at 4 per cent since November What will happen to interest rates depends in part on the response of the exchange rate the oil price and wages to developments in the economy he said ,3
2002-06-21, Big Food Group directors waived cash bonuses of more than 40 per cent of salary according to the food retailer and wholesaler's annual report However the board's remuneration committee is to use the £544000 which would have been shared between the four executive directors to buy shares in the company These will be awarded to the directors if they meet current year profit targets The shares rose 1{1/2}p to 106{1/2}p yesterday Bill Grimsey Big Food Group's chief executive received total pay of £767133 for the year to March while Bill Hoskins finance director received £403650 Their salaries in the previous year were not comparable as they only joined the company in January 2001 The report said that the necessary conditions had been met to trigger bonuses for the 2001-02 financial year The group which now includes the Iceland retail chain and the Booker food distribution business reported a pre-tax profit of £12 8m for the year compared with a £121 4m loss The group has borne substantial exceptional costs and high interest charges as it struggles with a restructuring and heavy debts Under the bonus scheme executive directors are entitled to a 40 per cent bonus if they meet the profit target rising to a maximum of 100 per cent of salary for above target performance The report also showed that the company is defending two legal claims one from an organic supplier and the other relating to the sale of a business However the directors said they did not believe the claims would have any significant financial effect on the group  Northern Foods directors did not earn a bonus last year when profits fell from £104 1m to £101m before exceptional costs and goodwill amortisation The total pay of Jo Stewart chief executive fell from £423051 to £379735 Remuneration of Sean Christie finance director dropped from £278711 to £254122 The group's bonus scheme has a target based on earnings per share growth and in 2001-02 could have ranged from 25 to 35 per cent of salary Directors are also awarded share options which can only be exercised after three years if earnings per share have grown by 3 per cent a year in real terms over the period ,2
2002-06-29, Wall Street banks are to be sued for millions of dollars as early as next week by some of the largest US public pension funds over WorldCom bond losses The pension funds bought up large amounts of an $11 9bn WorldCom bond offering in May 2001 at the time the third-biggest corporate bond issue ever They are angry that the banks played a part in certifying the bonds as investment grade when WorldCom's financial statements were already being fraudulently manipulated JP Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney were the lead underwriters of the bond issue The pension funds will also be targeting for compensation the other managers of the offering Deutsche Banc Alex Brown ABN Amro and Banc of America Securities Lawyers negotiating with the pension funds over representation said yesterday that a class-action suit could be filed next week Milberg Weiss a US law firm best known for its shareholder and bondholder litigation plans to take a lead role The New York State Common Retirement Fund yesterday confirmed it was seeking lead plaintiff status in one of the suits The Florida State Board of Administration whose WorldCom bond losses stand at $60m is also taking action Calpers the number one US pension fund with assets of nearly $150bn had the largest WorldCom losses with stock losses of $235m and bond losses of $330m Milberg Weiss lawyers say WorldCom used much of the $11 9bn proceeds from the offering to pay off short-term debt with the banks They allege that the banks therefore improved their positions with WorldCom at the expense of the investors WorldCom's accounts for 2001 and the first quarter of this year were revealed this week to have a $3 8bn hole causing its bonds to drop to levels that assume bankruptcy is imminent The banks will face allegations that they are liable for any false information that was contained in the offering's prospectus and that they should have known WorldCom's books were fraudulent JP Morgan yesterday denied responsibility for investor losses We did thorough due diligence and the kind of fraud that has been revealed is not the kind that underwriters could have picked up  It's like Minority Report  one banker said referring to the recently-released science fiction movie We're guilty of something that was going to happen in the future  Salomon said it had also done thorough due diligence and added that federal securities laws permitted it to rely on financial statements that had been certified by the company's auditor Andersen Plaintiff lawyers say Salomon is just as liable as Andersen Meanwhile JP Morgan took steps to shore up its credibility with investors regarding another Wall Street scandal In an internal memo distributed yesterday the bank said it would simplify its stock ratings system and take steps to further separate research analysts' compensation from investment banking revenues The measures are similar to those adopted by Merrill Lynch last month as part of a settlement to end a probe by the New York attorney general into conflicts of interest in stock research ,2
2002-06-19, Andor Capital one of the largest technology hedge funds has held about 60 per cent of its assets in cash since September 11 according to an investor Those cash levels raise issues among some investors about what hedge fund managers are paid for and how they should be compensated Andor's cash level is understood to have recently fallen to 40 per cent but the $7 5bn fund's stock holdings still remain very low by historical standards Large cash holdings are commonly used by hedge funds to reduce a fund's volatility London-based hedge fund managers especially tend to have large cash holdings according to another investor In the turbulent markets of recent years many hedge fund investors have been grateful for those conservative holdings The second investor noted that one London manager had 60 to 70 per cent cash levels for most of last year but ended up posting returns of 11 per cent as a result Hedge funds' flexibility is one of their most attractive attributes But other investors are increasingly making the case that hedge funds should not be paid 2 per cent of assets and 20 per cent of profits for managing cash when other cash managers do the same thing for a few basis points They would prefer hedge funds return the cash if they cannot use it and take more aggressive positions with their money Aggressive investing does not always win investor plaudits however Zweig Dimenna another large hedge fund took the opposite approach to Andor A recent investor letter from a fund of funds manager noted that Zweig was 89 per cent long in equities Zweig Dimenna has long held the position that stocks rally as a result of the Federal Reserve Board easing interest rates Their strategy finally seems to be working At a time when the S&P 500 index is down more than 9 per cent and the Nasdaq is down 20 per cent for the year Zweig Dimenna's performance is roughly flat it has posted annual average returns of 22 per cent since inception 18 years ago But for much of the last year and a half it did not work so well Archstone said in its letter that it plans to reduce its Zweig Dimenna exposure at the end of this quarter One investor is suggesting that funds should get rid of their high-water marks provisions stating that a fund will not charge a fee if it falls by more than 15 per cent as a way of pushing them out of cash He argues that funds are excessively worried about protecting their franchises ,2
2002-06-01, Sulzer Medica Sulzer Medica has dealt with the plaintiffs Now it must outrun the predators With its independence in doubt the question is whether its new name Centerpulse will be around for long enough to make the rebranding worth it It has every reason to rejoice over the US court settlement Wielding the threat of bankruptcy adroitly Europe's top orthopaedics group has persuaded all but 87 US users of its faulty joint implants to settle Only 16 of these had revision surgery and are in the highest claimant category The cost of settlement is $725m but provisions up to $873m exist which should cover the extras The saga has hobbled the group however Indications of improving sales beyond the first quarter when they grew at 7 2 per cent do not amount to an investment case More of that was due to price than to volume and costs are far too high Unless a sensible strategy emerges that deals with the struggling cardiac unit the main fillip for its share price will be bid speculation With net debt around SFr900m a price of SFr275-280 would represent 10 times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation still cheap for its sector Smith & Nephew of the UK and Zimmer of the US may have an eye on its strong European orthopaedics franchise While it is still on crutches it remains easy prey ,2
2002-06-25, Majestic Wine has maintained like-for-like sales growth of about 12 per cent since its financial year ended on April 1 Tim How chief executive said Yes we have had the Queen's Jubilee and the World Cup But we have had no sunny weather and we are comparing with a period when the weather was good  Annual pre-tax profits rose from £4 5m to £5 9m and profits before amortisation rose 34 per cent to £6 1m £4 5m Total sales rose from £86 8m to £104 6m including £5 6m from The Wine & Beer Company which has four warehouses in France and was acquired in October for £7 2m Like-for-like sales last year were up 11 8 per cent and for the first 11 weeks of this financial year were up 12 2 per cent Mr How attributed the performance to the company's different approach which includes free delivery Last month the company which sells wine only by the case opened its 100th store in yet another converted former car showroom with good parking facilities Mr How believes the chain is continuing to take market share from high street off-licences The number of active customers who returned to the chain at least once last year rose 10 per cent to 271000 They spent an average of £102 each time about the same as the previous year More than 25 per cent of the customer base can now be contacted by e-mail enabling the company to send marketing material more often and cheaper than by post Internet orders rose from 2 to 3 per cent of the total and have a higher average value at £123 Earnings rose from 21 24p to 26 42p The proposed final dividend of 5 5p lifts the total from 6 6p to 8p Comment  The like-for-like figures must be seen in the context of an 8 per cent improvement in UK wine sales But you make your own luck and the concept driving the company is more than taking advantage of the growing market It is not difficult to see the chain expanding beyond the company's target of 150 The shares have been on a plateau for the past couple of months after climbing steadily from a 12-month low of 237{1/2}p in October On forecast profits before tax and amortisation of £7 3m this year the prospective multiple is 14 after yesterday's 22{1/2}p rise in the shares to 460p That takes them close to the 12-month high of 467{1/2}p but there still seems a little room for improvement ,2

2002-06-20, It was Vodafone's acquisition of the US wireless company Airtouch three years ago that vaulted Sir Christopher Gent into the big-time league of executive pay as Vodafone adjusted its own pay scales in response to the merger But by the standards of the average American telecommunications executive his remuneration looks almost paltry In the home of outsize executive compensation the biggest rewards from the 1990s bull market in telecoms fell to a group of people whose shares have done even worse than Vodafone Formerly fast-growing acquisitive US companies such as WorldCom and Qwest Communications handed hundreds of millions of dollars in option profits to executives who have seen their companies crumble around them Joseph Nacchio who was this week forced out as chairman and chief executive officer of Qwest made $102m £70m last year including a $24 4m pay-out under a long-term incentive plan and $74 6m in profits from exercising stock options These outlandish gains were nothing unusual Mr Nacchio had already made $173 5m after exercising options over the previous three years His gigantic profits which were quickly followed by Qwest's share price collapse this year helped to make him a target for angry shareholders However while the fallen stars of the bull market years reaped truly huge personal profits even the chairmen of more staid US telecoms companies have earned sums that would make Sir Christopher envious Ed Whitacre chairman of SBC Communications made $25m last year once his salary bonuses stock option exercises and other forms of pay were taken into account Charles Lee co-chairman of Verizon Communications made $21m last year while Ivan Seidenberg the other co-chairman made $13 2m Messrs Lee and Seidenberg have made more than $80m between them over the past three years This is all a far cry from Europe where some telecoms companies have been quick to cut stock option awards even if Vodafone has yet to follow suit ,2
2002-06-18, Zimbabwe may have the world's fastest shrinking economy with GDP forecast to fall at least 10 per cent during 2002 but it also boasts one of the world's most buoyant stock markets Since the new year began industrial share prices on the Zimbabwe stock exchange have surged 68 per cent and reached a new high last Friday The explanation for the dramatic divergence between events in the real economy and those on the stock market is simple enough Inflation currently 122 per cent is roughly four times the yield on government securities all part of the government's strategy of inflating away the country's escalating domestic debt Inflation which has doubled in the past year has driven investors into equities hence the ZSE boom real estate and foreign exchange Although foreign currency is the preferred investment it is not easy to access legally unless one is prepared to trade in the parallel market which over the past 18 months has moved pretty much in lockstep with the equity market At the beginning of 2001 the Zimbabwe dollar pegged in the official market at Z$55 to the US dollar was trading in the parallel market at around Z$75 a premium of some 35 per cent By last August the Zimbabwe dollar had slumped to Z$350 in the parallel market during which period equity prices on the ZSE had trebled Then for nine months industrials traded erratically within a relatively narrow range partly because the markets clearly anticipated a victory for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change in the March presidential elections and a return to economic orthodoxy When that did not happen and Mr Robert Mugabe was re-elected president for a third term it quickly became evident that the government would maintain both its cheap money policy in the domestic market and its pegged exchange rate Equities took off last month with the index putting on 50 per cent in six weeks Simultaneously so too did the exchange rate in the parallel market which is currently being traded at around Z$750 to the US dollar a devaluation of approximately 50 per cent in just six weeks All agree that eventually sanity will return to the markets but few if any are prepared to gamble on just how and when this will happen For those riding high in the equity market the very recent fall-off in demand for residential properties is seen by some as the first warning sign that the asset bubble may be about to burst A second warning sign is the recent sharp fall in bank reserves and bank lending But because the official money supply figures are published months after the event it is impossible to tell whether this is a result of a policy shift by the central bank or whether it reflects the outflow of foreign exchange One result is a question mark over listed financials which for much of last year led the ZSE Another is the rush into currency hedges such as London-listed Old Mutual which is one of very few hedge stocks available to Zimbabwean investors who are banned by exchange controls from undertaking portfolio investments abroad Tony Hawkins,2
2002-06-10, Rothschild Asset Management has poached a team of nine from JP Morgan Private Bank in a bid to re-affirm its position in the competitive private client market The move is part of a re-organisation of the £23bn fund management arm of NM Rothschild led by Paul Manduca RAM's chief executive since 1999 It follows the relaunch last year of five arrows Rothschild's retail fund brand and the hiring of new executives including David Kidde who was plucked from Hill Samuel Asset Management as chief investment officer Dean Lush co-head of the private clients operation said Rothschild hoped to double its London-based private client business to £2bn of assets in the near term The recruitment of the JP Morgan team will benefit clients by expanding RAM's investment resource and product offering  The team was formed at Fleming the UK group and later incorporated into JP Morgan after the US bank's merger with New York rival Chase Manhattan which owned Fleming It includes Malcolm Roberts who will become co-head of the private clients operation and Peter Martin who has been appointed chief investment officer for private clients If last year's push into retail funds represented a cultural shift for Rothschild the latest move may be seen as a return to its roots as investment manager for Europe's elite This is the first business Rothschild got into when it was set up 200 years ago said Mr Lush dismissing suggestions that Rothschild was reassessing its commitment to fund management RAM will now have a 30-strong private client operation including 12 investment professionals Mr Martin said his team would work closely with RAM's institutional fund managers Mega-banks often claim that they are also doing this but at RAM we actually sit in the same room as our institutional colleagues he said The firm was keen to focus on private clients with £1m-£5m of liquid assets ,1
2002-04-26, The US Senate was preparing to vote on the energy bill last night with the business community predicting overwhelming support for legislation expected to produce no big winners or losers To get the bill approved by the Democratic Senate in the post-Enron environment is in itself a big win for the industry Still it gives the energy companies far less than the House energy legislation passed last year and contains more provisions to appease environmentalists There were no outright huge winners or losers In general that probably means that overall this bill represents good energy policy said Jonathan Weisgall of Mid-American Energy Holdings Company a diversified producer A lot of stakeholders got a half bite of the apple  The weeks of debate have left a long list of winners as well as whiners who feel they did not get enough Chief among the latter are proponents of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge who failed to get even a majority of Senate votes so they could not blame their defeat on Democrats alone There's something for everyone in the bill but King Corn basically beats King Oil said Keith Ashdown of Taxpayers for Common Sense a group which tracks subsidies He ticked off a long list of tax breaks Coal got $1 9bn for clean coal technology Nuclear got a couple of a billion Oil got $2bn £1 3bn Ethanol a grains-based fuel addictive already had $2 5bn in subsidies but it got a 5bn gallon market share by 2012  The Senate approved $14bn in subsidies the House $22-25bn The Senate has no dog in this fight so they'll split the difference Mr Ashdown said We're looking at $22bn-$25bn  The electricity sector has much to cheer about Heading the companies' wish list was a provision that would repeal the 1935 Public Utility Companies Holding Act known as Pucha The lobbyists say it constrains their operations limits investment and acts as a barrier to interstate independent transmission companies Repeal of Pucha is a huge deal for us said Kristy Simms a lobbyist for Entergy a multi-state energy giant Currently we need to get exemptions to build new plants which we usually get but we pay enormous legal fees  Mary Kenkel of Cinergy a big coal and gas company based in Ohio said repeal of Pucha will allow companies to more easily merge and expand We would have liked to see more tax benefits for pollution control equipment she said Clean coal money really helps the people who manufacture the technology  As well as the large companies hundreds of small and medium-sized producers consultants software providers and traders have stakes in the legislation Wind solar biomass and geothermal producers will reap the benefits of the so-called renewable portfolio standard which requires all electric companies energy suppliers and utilities to use renewable energy resources in their energy mix by 2020 The same provision sets up atrading mechanism among electricity providers which benefits companies such as NatSource of Washington and New York which trades emissions permits The bill also helps software companies such as Excelergy Corporation located near Boston which provides programmes to spur efficiency and the costs of real-time electricity trading Farmers will profit from the increased demand for ethanol Alternative fuel producers gain from a requirement that 75 per cent of the federal government's vehicles be required to use such fuels Manufacturers of duel-use vehicles and fuel cell cars get tax credits for their customers And Alaska it appears is not a big loser after all It will get tax incentives for a mammoth construction scheme a $20bn $3600 natural gas pipeline to the lower 48 states exploiting reserves reckoned to be large enough to provide gas to American consumers for the next 30 years For regional reports www ft com/usa,3
2002-06-10, Alistair Darling's appointment as transport secretary is widely regarded as evidence of the Treasury's tightening grip on transport policy Mr Darling after all is a former Treasury number two and a close ally of Gordon Brown the chancellor One of his most pressing tasks will be to get a grip on Britain's extravagant but inadequate rail system The choice of minister should be no surprise Mr Darling's arrival to replace Stephen Byers it can be argued is an encroachment by a Treasury that is likely to be more hands-on towards an industry that was privatised just five years ago Railtrack say many observers is renationalised in all but name The infrastructure owner was put into administration by Mr Byers in October and is likely to be bought soon by a government-backed consortium Yet almost unnoticed ministers are also wresting back control of train operations Of course the government is at pains to deny that either Railtrack or the 25 train operating franchises have been renationalised The state does not own the companies and therefore they are private Others argue that what counts is not ownership but control and here the government's sway over both Railtrack and the train companies has increased to the point that to all intents and purposes it is in charge As Jon Shaw of Aberdeen university argues What we have gone from is the type of privatisation where government retained almost an unprecedented level of contact and interest in the industry to even further down that road If you couldn't argue it was nationalisation by another name before increasingly you can now  Network Rail the not-for-profit company that is likely to replace Railtrack is owned by more than 100 members representing the industry and public interest The government through the Strategic Rail Authority has funded the bidding costs and would underwrite part of up to £9bn debt The SRA would choose the first board appoint a non-executive director and be one of the members from which position it is expected to broker decision-making The model has striking parallels with the renationalisation of British Rail in 1948 Moreover it is expected that Network Rail will be increasingly subsidised by SRA grants rather than indirectly through train operators further enhancing government influence Network Rail insists the charge of renationalisation is wholly wrong We won't even entertain the thought It's simply not the case says Iain Coucher managing director Both Network Rail and the government have been working with the Office for National Statistics to ensure that the company is not judged to be under government management or financial control Doing so means that Rail track's £9bn debt is not counted against the public sector borrowing requirement The ONS ruling does not convince everyone however You don't have to own something to control it argues Dieter Helm a fellow of Oxford university and director of Oxford Economic Research Associates consultancy All the main management decisions all the planning and control and the major part of the finance are in effect all in public control De facto it's nationalisation but they've been careful to make sure it's not de jure  The government's deepening involvement in the rail infrastructure is not the whole story however Train operators are also being drawn into public control When the SRA was devised the 1998 integrated transport white paper said it would provide a strategic programme for the industry That strategic plan now dictates where investment will go for the next 10 years and how enhancement projects are designed and rules on proposals by operators The authority is talking to City institutions about financing the improvements and is underwriting some train orders The SRA's role in daily operations is similarly increasing The authority is organising driver training intervening in pay disputes negotiating power supply and setting up a special insurance scheme Last tenders for new franchises set out in much greater detail what bids must offer Chief executives of rail operators are talking about giving even more responsibility to the SRA Faced with continuing low margins and high fixed costs some operators are reluctant to take a chance on uncertain long-term revenue streams and want to renegotiate subsidy and service levels every few years or even annually For enhancement projects GoVia a train operator has warned that uncertainties over such issues as the future of the infrastructure mean the SRA will have to underwrite more and more work A lot of us wish it wasn't proving to be necessary but it is says one operator As with Railtrack this is not a direct renationalisation But argues James Sherwood president of Sea Containers which owns the GNER franchise train operators have become nothing more than contractors in a state-controlled industry They are saying your profit can be a certain per cent of turnover you have a short franchise you can't make any capacity investment unless we approve it it's just a management contract he says Again the government disputes the idea that train operations are as good as renationalised The idea is to draw a line at an appropriate level so we get the best out of the private sector and provide a transparent framework both strategic and financial to encourage that says one official The moot point is whether the government's deepening involvement however termed is a change for the better Some believe public services are better protected and less expensive if the Treasury does not have to pay big margins to private companies to take on risk often only superficially in any case Others worry that the industry will suffer from too much interference raising the cost to the Treasury in the long run As George Muir director-general of the Association of Train Operating Companies says The fundamental truth is outsourcing does not get rid of all risk The underlying risks always come back to the person who wants it the product the outsourcer ,3
2002-06-03, Fischer friend Gerhard Schroder Germany's chancellor is trailing badly in the polls but in case anyone still thought he was keeping the option open of an alliance after September's election with the liberal Free Democrats he set them straight yesterday His Berlin conference speech vilified the FDP for flirting with rightwing populism The target was obviously Jurgen Mollemann the FDP's parachute-jumping vice-chairman whose allegedly anti-Semitic comments recently have prompted calls for a retraction by FDP barons Schroder warned of German foreign policy falling into the hands of amateurs But in fact Schroder only mentioned one person in his 85 minute speech and showered praise on him Step forward Joschka Fischer foreign minister and popular lead candidate for the Green party Schroder's existing coalition allies for better or worse ,3
2002-06-12, For nearly half of its young life the Neuer Markt has been in the doldrums Launched by the Deutsche Borse in March 1997 Europe's answer to the Nasdaq was a dream performer for the first three years its All-Share index rising 1700 per cent by March 2000 In 2000 alone it attracted 133 initial public offerings IPOs more than all other European growth markets together But by its fifth birthday the Neuer Markt was struggling to rebuild its reputation which had by then been tainted by sharp share price falls profit warnings scandals and insolvencies The Nemax 50 index is languishing below 1000 down from more than 9600 while the number of IPOs in 2001 was a paltry 11 Among the most high-profile of the scandals has been the fall from grace of media company EMTV whose founders face legal action over allegations of share price manipulation and intentionally publishing incorrect figures EMTV's share price had collapsed after it radically cut its forecasts in late 2000 just weeks after giving assurances on its targets More recently it emerged in April that traffic information provider Comroad had massively overstated sales Days later computer games developer Phenomedia said it discovered its 2001 accounts were inaccurate and dismissed two managers In May it became the latest Neuer Markt member to file for insolvency Although it is keen not to over-regulate the Deutsche Borse has responded to concerns about the market's reputation with a series of reforms Although its regulatory framework was already among the tightest in Europe the added measures are aimed at weeding out non-performers and ensuring that the quality of new entrants is more rigorously checked than at the height of the bubble In December 2000 Deutsche Borse unveiled new rules requiring directors to disclose share dealings and procedures to improve and standardise quarterly reports It also began to name and shame offenders by publishing infringements of its regulations A major study commissioned last summer resulted in tighter regulations for IPO prospectuses announced in April Also last summer the Borse announced rules for delisting so-called penny stocks Echoing rules in force on the Nasdaq these provide for the delisting of Neuer Markt companies whose shares trade below {XEU}1 and whose market capitalisation stands below {XEU}20m for a sustained period of time They also allow it to remove insolvent companies Eleven companies have been removed under the insolvency criterion Others have left voluntarily or been acquired cutting the number of companies on the Neuer Markt by 54 from around 345 at its height The penny stocks reform was welcomed by many for aiming to remove companies whose under-performance clouds the wider market's image and whose low price and liquidity make them susceptible to manipulation and unattractive to fund managers It was however quickly challenged in court by companies affected by them illustrating the difficulties the Borse faces in its image- polishing efforts In April the exchange was forced to suspend the rules after a court ordered it to halt delistings of several companies The introduction of further financial markets reform in Germany will give the exchange leeway for more reform but the episode has made the Borse appear like it has little power to enforce substantive changes says Giuseppe Guido Amato researcher at broker Lang & Schwarz The reforms now look merely cosmetic and any sentiment-boosting impact is long gone  Meanwhile calls for a slimmed-down segment of top companies a Nemax 30 as opposed to a Nemax 50 are impracticable the Borse argues with too many products such as derivatives linked to the existing Nemax 50 index At the end of the day even the best regulatory framework cannot prevent criminal behaviour or sheer mismanagement says Markus Straub of the SdK shareholders' association The shakeout is set to continue to tarnish the market's image while a sustained recovery in share prices or a much-needed influx of quality IPOs are not on the horizon for the time being Repower a wind power company broke the deafening eight-month silence on the IPO front in March The offer was five times subscribed but the shares are now trading at around {XEU}38 well below the {XEU}41 issue price and the pipeline remains woefully dry Analysts agree that despite the downturn there are two dozen or so companies that still enjoy decent liquidity and coverage and offer stock-picking potential However many mid-level companies those that are neither penny stocks nor heavyweights such as T-Online are too illiquid to lure large investors Institutionals find it difficult to invest in these even if they look promising as large deals can rapidly skew the price For private investors with smaller amounts to invest this may not be an issue But many have been too badly burned to venture near equities in general and the Neuer Markt in particular in the medium term The confidence of private shareholders has been shaken not only by the Neuer Markt but also by the fall of the people's share Dax heavyweight Deutsche Telekom The stock's collapse from {XEU}103 at its peak to below its {XEU}14 32 issue price has badly dented nascent shareholder culture in Germany says Mr Straub So severe has been the damage argues shareholders' rights group DSW that the Neuer Markt should be reorganised as it has no future in its current form Others including the SdK do not go quite as far and believe the market has an important role to play in giving young companies access to the capital markets I believe the Neuer Markt will not vanish It is like saying you will never touch another drop of alcohol the morning after you have partied too hard When the next party comes most of us will have a drink says Mr Amato The question is when is the next party Not for many years and until then the hangover will stay ,2
2002-06-15, Esporta which faces a hostile takeover bid from Duke Street Capital said the private equity group had spotted an imminent turnround at the health clubs operator but was not offering shareholders the corresponding value Esporta shares yesterday lost {1/2}p but at 82p were still above Duke Street's 80p cash offer They have been very clever They've spotted the turnround but they're valuing the business on last year's figures said Maurice Kelly chief executive In adefence document issued yesterday Esporta said like-for-like sales were up 26 per cent in the first five months of 2002 The group also claimed to have achieved annualised cost savings of £5m by outsourcing catering and reducing capital expenditure Mr Kelly said last year's figures had been held back by the biggest opening programme in the group's history Of the current estate 30 per cent were opened last year he said Nick Irens chairman of Duke Street's bidding vehicle and formerly chairman of Cannons another health club operator said Esporta was asking shareholders to make a leap of faith in supporting an uncertain turnround Why should shareholders trust them when they've failed to deliver time and again he asked He said revenue growth Esporta gave in its defence was not sustainable Last year like-for-like sales growth was 6 per cent But Mr Kelly was convinced that investors are beginning to register that this turnround is not a flash in the pan Duke Street knows the harvest is coming Mr Kelly said The private equity group is the biggest shareholder with 24 8 per cent The next largest with about 10 per cent is Crown Sports which did not comment on the bid At 80p per share Duke is giving an enterprise value to the group of 9 9 times last year's ebitda of £20 8m Mr Ball said that with £5 5m of annualised cost savings secured in the past five months and adding back the loss of £4 7m incurred on club openings last year pro-forma ebitda for last year was £30 3m This would reduce the multiple to 6 8 times Cannons was sold in a management buy-out 18 months ago on a multiple of about 12 times But look at what has happened since then said Mr Irens Ratings have fallen significantly across the sector ,1

2002-04-03, Services across northern England are likely to be severely disrupted by a 48-hour strike by rail workers on Friday after peace talks ended without agreement yesterday Leaders of the Rail Maritime and Transport union met managers from Arriva Trains Northern but claimed that the company had made little effort to resolve a long-running dispute over pay Bob Crow the union's general secretary accused Arriva of treating workers with contempt following a recent announcement of a big increase in profits for Arriva's parent company They handed shareholders a 5 per cent rise but are still offering only 3 per cent to the people who do the work and create the profits Mr Crow said It is about time the company started looking for ways to solve this dispute instead of looking for new ways to penalise our members and the travelling public  Meanwhile commuters in the north-west faced severe disruption yesterday as 700 train drivers staged a 24-hour strike on routes run by First North Western the region's biggest rail operator The company suspended all its 1500 trains which carry about 90000 passengers a day on routes between Carlisle and Birmingham and Holyhead and Sheffield The strike mainly by members of Aslef the train drivers' union was called over the sacking of one of its members who drove through two consecutive red lights and disciplinary action taken against three other drivers The union which is to resume talks with management today said there would be 24-hour stoppages on Friday and next Monday unless a settlement was reached Dave Kaye managing director at First North Western said the company would not compromise on safety Our passengers have a right to demand safety on our railways and we are not prepared to compromise on that he said The union said its drivers had been treated too harshly by the company which it accused of acting in an unjust and draconian way We take safety as seriously as anybody else but we do not believe that safety is the primary issue here the union said Tube workers represented by the RMT also rejected a proposed pay rise of 2 per cent by London Underground The union has given LU until April 18 to come up with a sensible offer or risk a dispute www ft com/railstrike,3
2002-04-01, Since the government of Eduardo Duhalde took office in January vowing to bring Argentina under control it has staked everything on a new agreement with the IMF Argentine officials have said they need more than $20bn £14bn {XEU}22 7bn in fresh aid to rebuild the country's shattered banks and defend the currency However senior IMF officials have been stung by criticism that the lending body was too lenient with Argentina in the past even to the suggestion that Domingo Cavallo the former economy minister managed to force the lender into extending the last $8bn round of aid in August by announcing a deal before it had been agreed This time around the IMF under the new management of Horst Kohler and Anne Krueger his number two and its main shareholder the US have vowed to take a tougher line with Argentina Senior IMF officials say Mr Duhalde's government has been moving in the right direction in its three months in office particularly since reversing a series of populist measures taken early on in his tenure which had sought to place the burden of devaluation on foreign investors But they warn that much more needs to be done before they will grant any more aid The IMF and other official lenders have committed around $28bn to Argentina in the past 15 months Payments were halted in December when it became clear Argentina could not comply with the conditions Within a month two governments collapsed amid nationwide rioting that claimed 27 lives and the government defaulted on its $141bn in debt and devalued its currency As it begins the long and arduous task of negotiating the next aid package in Buenos Aires today the IMF is demanding tough measures to avoid a replay of December's disasters Specifically the fund wants Argentina to amend its new bankruptcy law which made it hard for creditors to collect on bad debts and scrap the 1970s-era economic subversion law which they say has been used by judges to persecute bankers in Argentina Most importantly the fund wants a rewrite of the co-participation law that dictates how national tax revenues are shared out between the federal government and the 24 provinces This task has been so politically sensitive that governments have put it off for years Instead the law has been periodically amended as the four-year economic recession hit tax revenues IMF officials felt the latest effort to renegotiate the law merely amounted to a bailout for debt-laden provinces The Argentines have done a lot but there are still a number of things that remain said a senior IMF official The central point is a credible agreement with the provinces  The IMF also wants to impose a hard budget constraint on the provinces themselves which would include a ban on printing provincial currencies to pay bills and workers Such practices which have become widespread in the past year have led to monetary chaos in Argentina as different pseudo-currencies proliferate The lender also wants the central bank to stop intervening to prop up the peso which has fallen by two-thirds since the currency peg to the dollar was dropped in early January Argentina's government agrees with many of these objectives but fears that it would not survive the political fallout from such deep-seated change Mr Duhalde is in power mainly thanks to the Peronist provincial governors whose interests would be affected by such fiscal reforms From a technical point of view they are not miles away from reaching a new aid agreement the IMF official said From a political point of view it's much harder to tell  Mr Duhalde has warned that without an aid lifeline his government could collapse plunging the country into fresh chaos But that is a risk the IMF and US appear willing to take to force politicians to undertake the painful reforms that would make an economic programme sustainable Scenarios that involve the fall of Duhalde are not attractive to us said a US government official However he stressed it should be even less attractive to members of the current political class who are almost universally blamed for Argentina's 70-year decline and the economic crisis All things being equal that is a situation they might want to avoid especially given that the popular view of politicians is at an all-time low the US official said www ft com/argentina For regional reports www ft com/usa www ft com/americas,3
2002-06-05, Knight Trading a leading Nasdaq market-making firm confirmed yesterday that US securities regulators had launched investigations into its business practices However the company said the allegations made against it by a former employee were unfounded and without merit Yesterday Knight's shares ended the day down 21 62 per cent or $1 28 at $4 64 The former employee Robert Stellato filed an arbitration claim against the firm late last year with regulators at the National Association of Securities Dealers The claim included allegations about the firm's trading practices Knight said yesterday all Mr Stellato's allegations were untrue and that when they had surfaced it had conducted its own review Thomas Joyce Knight's president and chief executive said Mr Stellato originally raised concerns about an institutional trading practice last year and Knight's compliance department conducted an immediate review with Mr Stellato and determined that the concerns were unfounded  The revelation of the inquiries is the second embarrassment this week for Knight once a highly profitable trader that in recent years has hit hard times On Monday a software glitch caused the firm's computer systems to issue sell orders of its own stock about one hour before the market opened Before the firm explained the nature of the problem there was widespread speculation in the market that Knight was under investigation and the stock had fallen by more than 50 per cent to $3 when trading was halted The bogus trades were later cancelled but Knight's shares continued to trade lower throughout the rest of Monday Yesterday the company said the regulatory probes were a routine inquiry ,2

2002-06-17, Emerging markets are back on investors' radar After the desperate disappointments of the Tequila crisis of 1994 and the Asian crisis of 1997-1998 suddenly money is again pouring into the equity and debt markets of less developed nations We have had more interest from potential clients in the last six months than we have had in the past four to five years says Kenneth King managing director of Rexiter Capital Management an emerging markets investment specialist Investor enthusiasm has been buoyed by some exciting returns While the US UK German and French stock markets are all down on the year and were falling sharply late last week Indonesia is up 74 per cent in dollar terms Russia 50 per cent Thailand 44 2 per cent and South Africa 30 1 per cent In part the revival of emerging markets is because of the rebound in the global economy after last year's slowdown As the US and European economies pick up speed the prospects of Asian and Latin American exporters improve Emerging markets are a geared play on global economic recovery says Ian Scott global strategist at Lehman Brothers Asian growth forecasts are already being revised higher According to Consensus Economics the Singapore economy is expected to grow by 4 per cent this year after shrinking by 2 per cent in 2001 the Thai economy is expected to grow by 3 4 per cent after 2001's 1 8 per cent and South Korea by 5 6 per cent after 2001's 3 per cent But higher growth is not the only factor behind the revival in the popularity of emerging markets After all emerging markets have shown very strong growth in the past but this has not always been translated into gains for overseas investors The crises of 1994 and 1997-98 prompted disillusionment about the competence of economic management in many Asian and Latin American economies and about the treatment of outside investors The hope is that emerging market governments and corporations have now learnt their lesson The catastrophic developments of 1997 and 1998 may have been a blessing in disguise by ridding the region of cronyism and over-investment says John Mytton who runs the GAM Asian fund in Hong Kong Standards of corporate governance have gone up If you're still standing after all the crises you must have done something right to survive Previously companies would go for market share and not worry about leverage now they're a lot more focused on return on capital says Mr King He cites Brazil which set up a market where companies can list only if they have complied with rigorous standards and South Korea which has improved its corporate governance Stock prices go up sharply when they can demonstrate good corporate governance so it is in management's interest to do so he says Furthermore the relative position of emerging markets has changed on this issue In the 1990s it was assumed the US corporate sector had the highest standards of corporate governance and accounting treatment The collapse of Enron and problems at companies such as Tyco and WorldCom has cast doubt on that view Indeed the loss of confidence in the developed world seems to have sparked a reassessment of the prospects for emerging markets More non-dedicated money is moving into emerging markets from total return funds after they became uncomfortable with the growth prospects of the developed world says Philip Poole head of emerging markets economics and debt research at ING In particular he says there has been a reallocation of cash out of US corporate bonds and equities Mr King says long-term factors have pushed many pension funds to consider emerging markets Institutions everywhere have seen their surpluses disappear and many have gone into deficit How are they going to meet their actuarial rate of return of 8 5-10 per cent Both the US and continental European markets look pricey so they have started to look around for other areas The result has been net flows of capital into emerging markets  The disappointing performance of US and European markets in the past two years has forced investors to look in unfamiliar areas Emerging markets are now perceived as being relatively cheap given improved corporate governance standards and their superior economic growth prospects At the start of the year the outlook for emerging markets did not seem so bright because of Argentina's debt default and peso devaluation But these problems had been well signalled and the crisis when it occurred failed to have a big impact on other markets However Argentina's problems mean the revival in emerging markets has been focused on Asia and eastern Europe There is a bias against Latin America says Mr Poole Argentina has left a legacy particularly among European retail investors  The next test for investor sentiment towards Latin America may come from Brazil where presidential elections in October could see a victory for Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftwing Workers party There is genuine concern that Lula could be elected says Mr Poole The Real has been weak and there are worries about the short maturity profile of Brazil's debt  Another reason why Latin America is not proving a big magnet for investors' money is the lack of available companies The markets have been hollowed out says Mr King There are probably only 50 companies in the region with a market cap of more than $1bn  Eastern Europe in contrast has attracted a lot of money from investors eager to play the convergence factor before the accession of former Warsaw Pact countries into the European Union Russian markets have performed well as investors perceive improvement in the economic political and credit stability of the country and with the help of a fairly stable oil price But the bulk of investor money has headed for Asia The region seems rid of the after-effects of the 1997-98 crisis and its heavy weighting in the technology sector which has seen a sharp downturn in demand in the past two years The big test for emerging markets this time round may come if the US and European stock markets start to recover Will US and European portfolios shift back to their traditional homes Everyone seems to agree that to keep hold of investors' money emerging markets need to ensure that their rapid economic growth is translated into comparable growth in profits ,2

2002-06-05, New Zealand has expressed its sorrow and regret for the inept and incompetent way its colonial administrators controlled Samoa after it took control of the Pacific territory from Germany during the first world war Prime Minister Helen Clark made the apology at a formal state luncheon in the Samoan capital of Apia yesterday when dignitaries and a large New Zealand delegation celebrated the country's 40 years of independence In particular Miss Clark apologised for the decision of the administration which allowed a New Zealand ship the Tahuna to dock in Apia in 1919 when it was carrying passengers suffering from the global outbreak of influenza It was known Polynesian people had little resistance to the disease and in the subsequent epidemic 22 per cent of the population died It was one of the worst epidemics in the world and it was preventable Miss Clark said She also expressed regret for the shooting of 19 people in 1929 The 19 were part of the Mau movement which was pursuing a policy of peaceful civil disobedience to achieve self-rule Tuilaepe Sailele Malielegaoi the Samoan prime minister yesterday said Samoa had forgiven New Zealand 40 years ago when it gained its independence and did not seek the apology As a Christian nation Samoans believed in forgiveness he said Miss Clark said New Zealand did not intend to make any financial recompense to Samoa She noted that the two countries had subsequently had a long and close relationship and more than 115000 people in New Zealand identified themselves as Samoan She said Samoans had contributed substantially to the New Zealand economy They had also made many contributions to its sporting successes to the arts and to cultural development ,3
2002-06-12, For the past 29 years the Zahir family lived an unassuming life in the leafy Ol-jiata suburb of Rome with only their immediate neighbours referring to them as majesty aware that they were once and possibly future kings of Afghanistan Originally ousted by his cousin Daoud in 1973 former Afghan king Mohammad Zahir Shah's life in Italy was routine coffee and newspaper in the morning gardening the news a movie and then a book most recently biographies of Alexander the Great and Henry IV But the family recently traded the quiet life for the intrigue of post-civil war Kabul The 87-year-old Zahir Shah returned in April and many of his children and grandchildren followed This week with the meeting of the loya jirga  the United Nations-organised tribal assembly set to elect a new interim government for Afghanistan the Zahir family's 29-year time-out from the backstabbing of Afghan politics ended On Monday Afghanistan's six-month-old peace process halted momentarily amid media reports that the king would be a candidate for head of state The start of the loya jirga was delayed for 24 hours until these reports could be clarified according to Zalmay Khalilzad US special representative for Afghanistan By the end of the day the former king had disowned the statements which allegedly came from within his household But Zahir Shah or rather his popularity has nonetheless become a wild card in the Afghan peace process which had sought to manage a delicate power-sharing arrangement between the ethnic Tajik-led Northern Alliance which seized Kabul last November and Afghanistan's other ethnic groups Since his return his guest-house in Kabul has been mobbed daily by hundreds of tribesmen His 40-year-rule is remembered as the longest period of peace the country has ever known The US which helped the former king clarify his intention not to seek the presidency is concerned to ensure that he still champions Hamid Karzai the ethnic Pashtun chairman of the interim government and Zahir Shah's distant relative Diplomats say the former king has been convinced to accept the role of spiritual father or Baba of Afghanistan a protocol post with no executive powers Mr Karzai announced yesterday that Zahir Shah's titles and orders would be restored He would be the honorary chairman of the national assembly would have a supervisory role in the writing of the new constitution and would preside over national celebrations But many in the royal family are said to be unhappy with this decision seeing see this as a historical moment for the family to reclaim its right to rule Afghanistan and putting pressure on Zahir Shah to seek to be head of state However after negotiations this week the royal family appears to be quietly surrendering They are already negotiating posts in the government and that means they accept the position of Baba said a senior western diplomat in Kabul ,3
2002-04-16, Reader's Digest the magazine publisher yesterday said its two largest shareholders would give up control of the company as part of a dramatic shift in its ownership structure Two funds established by the company's founding families the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund will relinquish control under the new plan The structural change at the 80-year-old company is meant to attract new shareholders by giving them a stronger voice It comes less than a month after Reader's Digest made a controversial acquisition of magazine group Reiman for $760m Reader's Digest's two classes of stock will be recapitalised into one resulting in a reduction of the funds' voting power The funds will control 14 per cent of the vote down from 50 per cent The agreement will provide a more conventional governance structure much along the lines of most corporations said William White a member of the board All shares will have equal rights in the election of the company's directors and all shareholders will have the ability to vote consistent with their equity interest in the company  The move was supported by Highfields Capital Management which came out against the Reiman acquisition The deal is expected to close later this year The agreement is also likely to phase out the funds' representation on the Reader's Digest board The funds which have about 17 per cent of the total equity interest in the company own half the Class B voting stock and 12 per cent of the Class A stock After recapitalisation they will own 14 per cent of outstanding common stock The shares rose 2 26 per cent to $23 12 by midday in New York yesterday ,2
2002-06-28, Is it the beginning of the end When John Prescott the cabinet's biggest trade union stalwart quits the union he has belonged to for nearly 50 years something is clearly amiss between Labour and the union movement that founded it a century ago The deputy prime minister resigned from the RMT transport union after it withdrew financial support from him and 12 other MPs who refused to back rail renationalisation and oppose part-privatisation of the London Underground Alan Milburn health secretary and member of the Amicus technical union weighed in yesterday to warn that MPs and ministers would not be dictated to He called for a modern mature relationship but said Labour can't and will not act as proxies for the unions It may not yet be time to read the last rites The Communication Workers' Union at its Blackpool conference voted overwhelmingly yesterday to retain its Labour link despite unhappiness at the ending of Consignia's mail deliveries monopoly But it confirmed plans to withhold £500000 from the party over three years Labour's historic link is being questioned as never before Cabinet ministers such as David Blunkett are pressing for state funding of parties not just to escape rows about business donations but to avoid over-dependence on unions Unions have been nervous about New Labour since Stephen Byers predicted severing the link in a seaside restaurant in 1996 Strains are growing over a range of employment and industrial issues The Trades Union Congress announced that Charles Kennedy of the Liberal Democrats would be the first leader from one of Labour's political rivals to address its annual conference this autumn He may get a better reception than Tony Blair who will also speak To some extent all this is the result of not being able to satisfy everyone the longer the party is in power Keeping business sweet is proving no easier industry leaders are outraged by national insurance increases imposed on them in the Budget and increased regulation Sir John Egan president of the Confederation of British Industry accused the government this week of treating companies like voteless cows to be milked Digby Jones director-general said he had never known the level of mistrust and fed-upness in the British business community with this government as there is now Ministers feel they have bent over backwards to help workers having introduced the minimum wage working families tax credit and legislation on union recognition working time maternity part-time work fixed-term workers and those facing redundancy Public sector pay is rising The government is trying to assuage business ire by resisting Brussels moves to give agency workers the same rights as permanent staff Labour's worst problems are with a new wave of leftwing leaders in the smaller unions such as Bob Crow at the RMT and Mick Rix at Aslef and with John Edmonds at the GMB general union who fell out with Downing Street some time ago But when a moderate such as John Monks TUC general secretary describes Mr Blair as bloody stupid for linking up with Silvio Berlusconi Italy's rightwing premier and even the loyal Sir Ken Jackson of Amicus voices disquiet then clearly not all is well The main bugbear is how far the government will go in allowing the private sector into unionised public sector workplaces It will probably not come to mass disaffiliations unions that break away would lose influence But the relationship may never be the same again ,3

2002-06-04, Indonesia has launched one of its largest asset sales with the Rp15000bn $1 7bn programme including unrestructured bank loans taken over after the Asian crisis writes Tom McCawley from Jakarta The assets to be sold include some 2500 loans ranging from Rp5bn to Rp750bn taken over by Ibra the national bank agency The largest category of loans come from Indonesia's near-bankrupt conglomerates including Texmaco and Tirtamas Syarifuddin Temenggung Ibra chairman aims to sell all of the loans within two months at a recovery rate of 24-30 per cent However many analysts doubt it can achieve that rate of return The agency last week postponed a private placement of Bank Niaga due to low bids by overseas investors Ibra took over more than Rp200000bn in loans after the Asian financial crisis Many have been sold over the past four years This year Ibra has been assigned to raise more than Rp35000bn to help maintain the 2002 budget deficit at 2 5 per cent of GDP ,1
2002-04-19, Enterprise Oil experienced unusually high turnover as Shell Transport raided the market for a further 9 per cent of the equity The oil company bought 43 5m shares at the bid price of 725p a share through Schroder Salomon Smith Barney to take its stake in the exploration and production company to 29 per cent about the maximum it is allowed to buy in the market The ease with which Shell was able to get up to its limit more than a month ahead of the closing date for the bid was seen as a signal that there was unlikely to be any rival bid for the company Enterprise shares ended flat at 720p a slight discount to the bid price to reflect the delay shareholders face in getting their cash The shares had been as low as 713p because of speculation earlier in the day that Shell might either attempt to walk away from the deal or renegotiate for lower terms Enterprise is heavily involved in North Sea production and will be hit by the Budget's 10 per cent tax rise on oil profits

Bill to be announced on May 8 and there are hopes that it will relax the rules for mergers and takeovers However JP Morgan is much more cautious on the consolidation prospects Analyst Simon Mays-Smith said Contrary to popular belief in our view there is little opportunity for latent consolidation in the UK radio market under the proposed new rules  He hit out at recent speculation that the Daily Mail might be able to bid for GWR or that Capital Radio might be a target Capital fell 10 to 792{1/2}p and GWR lost 16 at 258{1/2}p EMI dropped 8{1/2} to 333{1/2}p with the generally downbeat tone in

2002-06-26, Far from being deterred by last year's global economic downturn Asia's wealthiest are turning to private bankers to manage their fortunes in ever greater numbers at least according to those in the industry Part of the reason is that for Asia the bubble burst five years ago with the region's devastating financial crisis of 1997/1998 The collapse of the internet boom in 2000 was a mere after-shock by comparison Sobered by the lessons of five years ago the region's once free-wheeling investors have become focused on preventing the same destruction of their wealth from occurring again Private banks that offer capital protection using new financial instruments and strategies have come into favour High net-worth individuals want to get away more and more from direct exposure on one or two stocks says Daniel Truchi chief executive officer of SG Private Banking Asia Pacific No banks provide a geographic break-out for the financial performance of their private banking arms But most claim they have been enjoying double digit growth in assets under management and net income in Asia SG Private Banking which serves clients with financial assets of $250000 or more says its net assets under management rose 100 per cent in 2000 and 35 per cent last year The company is on track for 30-35 per cent growth again this year Citigroup Private Bank whose target market is people with $5m in net assets and above claims a compound annual growth rate for net assets under management over the past five years of more than 25 per cent It says that since 2000 it has increased its workforce in the Asia Pacific region by 100 staff to about 750 Bankers say the profile of the typical Asian private banking client has been undergoing a rapid evolution over the past five years In Europe or the US wealthy individuals often use private banking services to minimise otherwise considerable tax bills and to ensure a steady income Investors in low tax Asia however often tend to be more hands-on Many are entrepreneurs who built their own wealth rather than heirs to old family fortunes They are used to being in full control of their companies so for them it's quite natural that they also want to keep their personal money side under tight control says Thomas Meier the chief executive and North Asia branch manager with Credit Suisse Private Banking The level of sophistication in the region is also rising in line with the number of people who have been educated in the top universities and business schools overseas Fewer clients are awarding their bankers full discretionary mandates particularly following the bear markets of recent years In the old days it was essentially very simple you park the money somewhere you were quite comfortable with your fixed deposits and your bonds and there was a little bit of punting done on the equity market says Mr Meier All of a sudden these guys want long/short strategies arbitrage structures event-driven strategies equity-linked notes  This rise in sophistication presents problems for smaller banks or newcomers to the industry SG estimates there are about 80 private banks in the region but about 50 per cent of total assets under management are controlled by the top 10-15 Consolidation is inevitable as the less committed are beginning to tire of the high-fixed costs of running a private bank The tough market conditions are also leading wary investors to stick with the bigger names You need to have the talent and the talent is costly and if you don't have a critical size you can't support that cost structure says Mr Meier Part of the problem is also that Asia's market remains relatively small and heavily regulated According to SG's Mr Truchi South Korea and Taiwan are the largest markets outside Japan with a total market size of about $450bn to $550bn Indonesia Malaysia and Thailand are smaller at about $100bn China with an estimated capital pool of $621bn is the holy grail However even after its entry to the World Trade Organisation last year China's banking and securities industries remain heavily regulated Beijing has a closed capital account limiting currency convertibility which immediately rules out many private banking products and services which are international by nature Banking securities and other financial services are kept strictly separate While the banking sector is scheduled to liberalise in the coming years securities will remain tightly restricted with foreigners limited to minority stakes We are really at the infant stage of the private banking market in China SG's Mr Truchi says Citigroup in April received a licence to handle foreign currency business from Chinese individuals and is setting up a branch in Shanghai But a full suite of services for locals remains a long way off At this point in time we are more investing in China as a future market says Kaven Leung Citigroup's Greater China head Mr Truchi said one alternative avenue into the market is through trust companies Beijing in October enacted a trust law allowing foreign participation in the sector Private banks could begin offering services ranging from securities and bond dealing and eventually fund management and other products through trust companies Another way for private banks to leverage China's growth is to manage wealthy mainlanders' offshore assets There is a small but growing number of entrepreneurs whose companies have listed overseas and who therefore have legitimate offshore assets Credit Suisse's Mr Meier says On the whole however Singapore and Hong Kong remain the main centres of private banking in Asia he says The regulatory regimes of most other countries in the region remained too restrictive You can roll out the full range of services here in Hong Kong it's practically impossible to do that to this extent in neighbouring countries ,2
2002-06-15, Movie producers in search of a storyline for their next Hollywood feature film need only to look to Wall Street these days for inspiration The demise of Enron opened a Pandora's box of corporate problems that have rocked the US equity market and shattered the confidence of many investors These days market participants do not even have time to digest all the scandals because as soon as one hits another one quickly takes its place Take Tyco International and Dennis Kozlowski its former chief executive who was indicted last week in New York on tax evasion charges Tyco and Mr Kozlowski were unceremoniously bounced off the front pages of every newspaper this week in favour of ImClone and its former chief executive Samuel Waksal who was charged with insider trading and perjury Mr Kozlowski likely appreciated the media's diversion The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mr Waksal of trying to sell about $5m worth of shares on December 26 two days before the US Food and Drug Administration announced its refusal to review the company's application for approval of its experimental cancer drug Erbitux Mr Waksal was unable to sell his shares after two different brokerage firms refused to execute the orders But the SEC alleges that he gave advance warning to family members who sold 79797 shares at about $60 each raking in more than $9m ImClone shares are trading around $8 after closing at a 52-week high of $75 94 on December 6 just weeks before the stock started its slide With controversies erupting on Wall Street it is not surprising that many investors are feeling jaded and suspicious about corporate America and the executives running the companies Christopher Wolfe head of US equity strategy at JP Morgan Private Bank said If somebody wrecks your trust how long does it take to repair the damage It's going to take time and the institutions that made these serious missteps will have to pay for them  The ImClone scandal took on a more sensational twist with Martha Stewart America's home-decorating icon embroiled in the controversy Ms Stewart a close friend of Mr Waksal also sold her remaining stake in ImClone 3928 shares at $58 each one day before the FDA announcement Ms Stewart has denied receiving an improper tip but shareholders of her company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia may have felt less certain While ImClone's stock held up this week shares in Ms Stewart's company tumbled 12 3 per cent to $15 a five-month low on Wednesday following the arrest of Mr Waksal who was freed on $10m bail Tyco shares also wobbled earlier this week amid investigations into the company's property disclosures But on Thursday the stock saw one of its best trading performances in months after the SEC cleared the way for Tyco to launch an initial public offering of CIT its financial services arm Shares rallied 36 per cent to $13 80 The IPO is crucial to Tyco's survival because the entire proceeds from the deal will be used to pay down Tyco's debt burden The company hopes to raise $5 to $5 5bn from the offering which would place it among the biggest US IPOs ever but many on Wall Street are already expressing doubts that Tyco's underwriters Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs will generate that much interest in the deal But even if the offering only raises $4bn which is the current talk in the markets the deal will provide a boost to the IPO market which has been mired in a two-year slump because of the downturn in the equity market Stocks continued to deliver a poor performance this week with the indices falling to their lowest levels in months and several disappointing economic reports including retail sales data and wholesale price figures in May adding to market jitters The retail report was especially discouraging to investors because it indicated that the consumer who has been the backbone of the economy could be weakening If consumer strength fades this will definitely hamper the economic recovery and provide more reasons for investors to stay bearish on the markets Even more troublesome to analysts right now is the health of corporate America Bulls are hoping that the next batch of corporate earnings will show signs of a pick-up For many investors that will be the only signal to bring them back into the markets mary chung@ft com,2
2002-06-03, BAA is expected to show its passenger volumes are on the road to recovery after the downturn caused by the September 11 attacks and Carphone Warehouse is likely to provide an update on the latest trends in consumer spending on mobile phones THURSDAY  BAA will reveal the full impact of the slowdown in global passenger numbers following September 11 when it reports figures for the year to the end of March Williams de Broe expects the January-March quarter to be level with the same period a year ago following a 10 per cent decline in the third quarter It expects growth in passenger numbers to recover to the long-term trend rate of between 4 and 5 per cent The broker forecasts a fall in underlying profits from £541m to £505m  Strong sales of mobile phones before network operators cut subsidies on handsets a year ago set a difficult target for Carphone Warehouse to beat in its results for the year to March 31 The retailer is expected to produce results static at about £49 5m pre-tax after it said in January that European markets were weaker and there had been a strong rise in sales of low-margin pre-pay phones It also said in January that its ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation would be 10 per cent below current expectations  The anticipated slowing of car sales in the US and Europe failed to materialise so Johnson Matthey is expected to show a rise from £180m pre-tax to about £186m for the year to the end of March Its sales of catalysts for vehicles and chemicals are likely to have done well and any weakness in industrial catalysts will have been offset by the pharmaceutical side and demand for platinum refining A consensus of analysts' forecasts compiled by Company Refs the statistical work suggests Johnson Matthey will produce a pre-tax rise from £180m to £186m  Wincanton is sometimes seen as a barometer of the outsourcing market so this set of figures for the year to the end of March may have an impact beyond the company's share price It will probably have escaped any ill-effects from the September 11 attacks and is expected to produce a 9 per cent advance in operating profits with a lower interest charge helping the pre-tax line to rise 14 per cent to £30m  Intel is expected to reduce its second-quarter sales forecast to the low end of its prior guidance of $6 4bn-$7bn £4 7bn during its mid-quarter update In the quarter-to-date we believe that Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have seen relatively weak processor demand said Wit SoundView analyst at Scott Randall While some of this is seasonally normal the lack of meaningful and visible corporate upgrade activity continues to act as a drag on unit demand he added According to the consensus estimates of analysts surveyed by First Call/ Thomson Financial Intel will report second-quarter earnings of 15 cents on sales of $6 67bn AFX News San Francisco  National Semiconductor is expected to report a fourth-quarter loss of 8 cents a share falling from break-even earnings reported in the prior year according to the consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial Sales are expected to reach $415 3m £284 4m compared with $401 2m a year earlier Recently NatSemi increased its fourth-quarter sales guidance to 12-13 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth Previous guidance had called for 6-9 per cent growth AFX News San Francisco  Compagnie Financie`re Richemont is expected to report net profit of {XEU}307m-{XEU}313m £213m against {XEU}529m for the year to March 31 Analysts forecast weaker results in the light of two

{XEU}3 68bn There was a 29 per cent decline in watch sales in the first quarter at Bulgari Nevertheless Richemont is trading at a discount of 11 per cent to the sum of its parts and at a discount of 8 per cent to the sector average AFX News Zurich  Royal Ahold will report first-quarter net profit of {XEU}309m-{XEU}326m £223m up from {XEU}316m in the year-earlier period according to analysts Operating profit is expected to fall within the {XEU}772m-{XEU}837m range against {XEU}671m last year In early May the company reported a rise in first-quarter sales to {XEU}22 2bn against {XEU}18 17bn and said it expected earnings per share to be in line with the {XEU}0 41 level achieved a year earlier AFX News Amsterdam FRIDAY  Tate & Lyle told us in March that its results would be towards the higher end of expectations and the food producer is now expected to achieve a rise in profits before exceptionals from £108m to £153m for the year to March 31 Increases in energy costs are expected to take some £65m off the bottom line although they have now stopped rising The integration of Staley and Amylum is likely to show benefits through the merger of purchasing and manufacturing

2002-06-20, It is Europe's equivalent of Chinese water torture European Union leaders only get together four times a year and when they do the prime ministers and presidents usually have burning issues for the 15-nation bloc to discuss For instance the EU summit starting tomorrow in Seville is supposed to focus on the vexed subject of illegal immigration But instead the most powerful politicians in Europe will have to endure a drip drip drip of discussion on subjects only the most junior of ministers could get excited about In a spectacle verging on the surreal Jacques Chirac France's reinvigorated president and Gerhard Schroder Germany's embattled chancellor will spend a sunny Saturday in southern Spain endorsing official conclusions on planning permission for mobile phone masts and the methodology for measuring public service performance Previous summits have had to deal with the Sorbonne-Bologna-Prague process on university degrees Austria's deeply obscure Ecopoints system for heavy goods vehicles and during crucial treaty negotiations at Nice in 2000 cattle in the Azores At one summit in Belgium last December a squabble over the location of a European Food Safety agency led Silvio Berlusconi Italian prime minister to complain The Finns don't even know what prosciutto is  This is the flaw in the EU set-up that caused Tony Blair to remark with heavy irony that attending the last such meeting in Barcelona was a joy as ever More seriously the bureaucratic tailback is already weighing the EU down and could grow still more grave when it takes in up to 10 more countries in 2004 Impossibly intricate European negotiations are nothing new Nearly 200 years ago the Duke of Wellington Tsar Alexander I and Austria's arch-powerbroker Prince Clemens von Metternich wrangled for months at the Congress of Vienna over who laid claim to lands including Western Pomerania and the Ionian islands Today's European leaders protest that they do not want to be swamped by detail The dysfunctional decision-making process in EU affairs prevents them from focusing on the big picture The issue is whether you want the heads of state and government to regain their leadership function said Daniel Gros director of the Centre for European Policy Studies Because of such concerns Javier Solana the EU leaders' foreign policy representative will this weekend put forward proposals to shake up the way the governments discuss and decide EU affairs At lower level meetings ministers often feel unable to deviate from their briefs and break through political impasse Worse the job of co-ordinating the EU governments' legislative agenda belongs to monthly meetings of foreign ministers whose own areas of competence are often very different If an issue is not settled by the states' expert ambassadors to the EU for instance it might be referred all the way to the leaders themselves Even bewilderingly technical affairs such as the hunt for a common European patent have fallen into prime ministers' laps in a desperate effort to add impetus to the legislative process In a paper written last year Mr Solana called for leaders not to be overloaded with issues that should be dealt with by their underlings as a matter of routine There are many reform plans on the table Perhaps most problematic is the six-monthly rotating presidency of the EU which determines which country controls the agenda Another often cited failing is the way issues mount up towards the ends of presidencies in June and December as the country in the chair tries to sign off its own pet projects Since EU legislation can take years to approve this means important issues often proceed only by fits and starts But any attempt to change the six-month rotation would have to overcome suspicion from small countries that longer terms of presidency would add to the sway of the biggest member states At Seville there's only likely to be a mini-reform which might make life a little easier said Mr Gros He added that any attempt to give more junior ministerial meetings a more dynamic role could be doomed Most important fundamental presidency reform would need to await the next EU treaty negotiations in 2004 now currently being prepared by a grand constitutional convention under former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing So Tony Blair and his colleagues had better steel themselves for more summits that resemble that famous description of a Wagner opera speckled with sublime moments but full of unbearable quarters of an hour Summit preview Page 8 Editorial Comment Page 20 www ft com/seville,3

2002-06-15, Unethical behaviour is as old as human history In fact a society in which some people do not violate the standards of behaviour to which the majority subscribe is inconceivable Yet the frequency and nature of the lapses vary over time and it is worth asking why We are now suffering from an excess of irresponsibly self-interested action many people are so anxious to promote their own interests or those of some group that they ignore the broader public good Consider three topical examples The first is the stupefying greed and corruption that now taints the reputation of corporate boardrooms and financial markets and for which Enron the US energy group has become a byword We can perhaps forgive the poor man who steals bread for a starving family But who can forgive wealthy executives and investment bankers when they lie steal and cheat in a bid for yet greater wealth In the UK another chilling trend is the growing incidence of cheating among teachers Yes I said teachers When I was at school teachers punished the occasional pupil for cheating but their own honesty was not in doubt But last year there were 270 reported instances of teachers falsifying their students' performance in tests and the total figure is probably much higher They were cheating to improve their schools' ranking in league-tables and also perhaps to win a performance award for themselves For a third example look no further than the tawdry world of British politics Labour has a massive parliamentary majority yet its political advisers still stop at nothing in their efforts to discredit opponents and manipulate public opinion In the latest unedifying case Dan Corry formerly an aide at the transport department sought to undermine a group led by a badly injured victim of a rail crash The fascination of unethical behaviour in politics is that it is often exercised on behalf of party rather than self but there is the same disregard for the common good What should we make of the rising incidence of chronically self-interested behaviour Is the transgression of ethical boundaries in realms as disparate as financial markets school teaching and politics just one of those things Is it just unfortunate that people seem increasingly incapable of recognising a public good that is independent of their narrow self or group interest I doubt it The unethical behaviour that is now blighting so much of public life is almost certainly a consequence at least in part of policy changes over recent decades It is partly a product of ever-increasing reliance on market and quasi-market mechanisms This may seem an implausible claim What after all is unethical about the institutions that underpin markets such as private property and contractual exchange The answer is that they are not in themselves unethical The problem is that they create a framework in which selfish motives almost inevitably become dominant What you can afford in the market depends on your income and wealth Your income and wealth depends on your trading acumen In every transaction in the market there is an incentive to buy low and sell high In other words there is an incentive to try to out-manipulate those with whom you deal There is an incentive to treat other people cynically as a means to your ends rather than as individuals whose own purposes have an intrinsic value And this kind of manipulation is perfectly legal Indeed it is deemed economically efficient Economists typically assume that individuals are self-interested but honest They think of people as personal utility maximisers that is as prone to take whatever steps they can to promote their own welfare But they also typically assume that people accept limits to their maximising behaviour in other words they try to get rich while obeying the law and without cheating or deceiving others Yet there is a problem here True utility maximisation is not consistent with behaviour that respects other social rules and norms If taken to its logical limits it naturally turns into wholly opportunistic behaviour After all if I regard my goal in life as to promote my own personal interests and if I am logical I should lie steal and cheat whenever I calculate that the likely gains will outweigh the likely losses In other words I should deceive others and break the law whenever I expect to get away with it The true utility maximiser is wholly amoral In extending the role of markets and in promoting market-style incentives even in the public sector such as league tables and performance-related pay for teachers policy makers are thus inadvertently helping to destroy moral fabric built up over generations In domain after domain they are instructing people to act economically in other words to put their self-interest ahead of everything else Why then should they be surprised that corporate executives teachers and political advisers seem increasingly incapable of recognising any limits to the exercise of self interest The sad reality is that an economic orientation in which morality has no place has become for many a total philosophy of life And it has become so with the blessing of our political leaders Can anything be done about it One thing is clear it is no use simply asking people to be more public-spirited If we want people to act less selfishly if we want people to be more motivated by considerations of the public good we have to rely less on mechanisms that glorify self interest We must accept in short that economic efficiency is not equivalent to social efficiency and that one can rely too much as well as too little on markets ,3
2002-06-27, The Bush administration will today come under fire for another aspect of its agenda when Senate environmentalists will seek to subpoena information on changes to pollution standards The subpoena to be introduced by Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont will seek administration documents relating to its decision to ease pollution enforcement on ageing coal-burning power plants As chairman of the Senate environment and public works committee Mr Jeffords has sought for months to obtain the documents from the Environmental Protection Agency concerning the administration's deliberations over proposed changes to the New Source Review programme In announcing its decision two weeks ago the administration said enforcement under New Source Review would be counterproductive because it would discourage power plants from performing regular maintenance activities which improve efficiency The committee today will also vote on Mr Jeffords' long-delayed four pollutant legislation which for the first time would regulate emissions of carbon dioxide which is thought by most scientists to contribute to global warming President George W Bush's change of heart on the issue he had promised such regulation on the campaign trail was one of the reasons for Mr Jeffords' defection from the party The subpoenas are the latest to come from the Democratic Senate drawing pubic attention to industry's role in developing the administration's energy and environmental policies Congress' General Accounting Office is also in court seeking information about Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force The EPA has already handed over 700 pages of documents and spreadsheets on New Source Review but committee aides said these were either blank or incomprehensible John Stanton of National Environmental Trust and a former EPA official said the agency is stalling because it does not want to reveal the role companies had in writing the plan Mr Jeffords has proposed a four pollutant bill which is expected to pass through the committee today to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide sulphur dioxide mercury and carbon dioxide It contains a birthday provision for utilities giving them until their 40th year in operation or until 2013 to instal the best pollution control technology available or shut down It is dramatic departure from the Bush Administration approach which is to recognise the danger of global warming agree with the science and then to do nothing about it said Mr Stanton Frank Maisano an industry consultant said the environmental community had written Mr Jeffords' legislation and no hearings had been held on it And he paints the White House as being too secret You tell me what's wrong with that twisted picture  Paul Oakley executive director of the Coalition for Affordable and Reliable Energy which includes many coal companies said Mr Jefford's bill would lead to power shortages and higher electricity prices ,3
2002-06-19, It is about as close as Brussels gets to a coup Romano Prodi often derided for being one of the weakest European Commission presidents in memory yesterday moved to take a grip on his able but fractious team of commissioners His plan to reform the Brussels executive is being hailed by his officials as the most ambitious since it was set up 50 years ago A new- look Commission would be streamlined and the power of the president enhanced The weaker or more disruptive of the 20 commissioners would be pushed into an outer circle leaving Mr Prodi and an inner cabinet of vice-presidents to take day-to-day control The impact was made all the greater by the fact that the plan was hatched in secrecy Neil Kinnock the commissioner responsible for administrative reform only found out last Friday This is completely within my power said Mr Prodi yesterday openly relishing the fact that he should be able to make changes without the usual grinding process of European Union consultation and amendments to the Treaty of Rome Under the EU Treaty each member state is allocated at least one commissioner with larger countries gaining two But once commissioners have been nominated by their countries it is up to the president to allocate them responsibilities Mr Prodi believes this also gives him the right to reorganise the way that the Commission works as a whole On the face of it Mr Prodi's plan is primarily a response to the planned enlargement of the EU in 2004 when 10 new countries are due to join swelling the ranks of the Commission to 25 or 30 members Mr Prodi's officials envisage the reform of the Commission being implemented in January or July 2004 But Mr Prodi's team admits that the plan has a more immediate purpose It is a striking attempt to assert the president's grip at a time when the Commission's is in the balance This week's EU summit in Seville comes at a decisive moment in the debate about the future of Europe The constitutional convention chaired by Valery Giscard d'Estaing is debating two visions of who should be in charge On the one hand it might be a strong EU council with a high-profile president probably a former head of an EU member state On the other it could be the Commission led by a president with a more powerful inner cabinet Tony Blair UK prime minister Jacques Chirac French president and Jose Maria Aznar Spanish prime minister are among those who want to see Europe being driven by the member states Talk over dinner in Seville will inevitably turn to the proposal by the three leaders for an appointed president of the EU council who would become the public face and political force of the new Europe Mr Aznar and Mr Blair have both been touted as candidates An inner cabinet would provide an answer to those who say the Commission's collegiate structure is already too unwieldy By setting up a smaller group around him Mr Prodi hopes to create a more cohesive team He won broad support for his ideas at a meeting of the Commission yesterday morning But there were signs of controversies that could develop Some commissioners and officials are worried that by having an inner and outer team Mr Prodi will create personality conflicts One example of the potential for tension is that Mr Prodi suggests putting a single vice-president in overall charge of both trade and external affairs These areas are covered respectively by Pascal Lamy and Chris Patten two of his most talented commissioners Some officials say it might be better to muddle along with the present structure until the current Commission's term concludes at the end of 2004 Another potential obstacle is the sensitivity of smaller EU states Some were concerned that this would lead to the big countries taking the lead simply because they would be most likely to get the new vice-president jobs says one person who attended the meeting Mr Prodi attempted to allay these fears by saying the new inner cabinet would be compiled on the basis of personal qualities not on the basis of passports although some suspect these are empty words Mr Prodi's team recognises the need for him to stamp his authority on the Commission His professorial manner and hands-off approach has been widely portrayed as weakness in Brussels diplomatic circles Ambassadors concur that while the Commission has talented members there is a Prodi problem One senior diplomat says If you look at the people in the Commission it is better than most of its predecessors but in spite of that its prestige and image is at a real low  Recent public spats within the Commission on issues such as car sale reform haulage tax and fisheries have bolstered the impression of disunity and weak leadership Mr Prodi's aides say he was particularly stung by criticisms by Mr Patten of a separate initiative to give the Commission more say in European foreign policy There is not much time for Mr Prodi to waste The EU council is busy reforming itself ahead of enlargement EU leaders are expected to agree at Seville to a streamlining of council meetings and the televising of meetings to improve accountability Mr Prodi's team recognises the threat This shows we are in the game and are prepared to make the fundamental reforms says one aide to Mr Prodi Despite their potential misgivings about the make-up of Mr Prodi's inner cabinet smaller EU countries are largely on his side in the constitutional debate They fear that an elected president of the EU Council would amount to a takeover of the EU by larger countries They tend to regard the Commission as guardian of the wider European interest and protector of smaller countries Mr Prodi argued yesterday that unless the Commission got its act together its critics would take the opportunity to limit its powers in areas such as foreign policy and home affairs Those who are against the Commission having a greater role have said that an enlarged Commission of 25 or 30 won't be able to operate We have to prove that it can  Above all there is a more aggressive stance around Mr Prodi as Commission officials gear up for the fight This is the day the gloves came off says one It is all most unlike Brussels ,3
1998-04-02, One of the trade unions most loyal to the government the rightwing AEEU engineering and electrical union is raising the political temperature in a dispute which it claims goes to the heart of Labour's controversial plans on union recognition The union will next week lobby Downing Street over a decision by ADT Fire and Security Britain's largest electronic security company to derecognise the AEEU ADT recently gave the AEEU notice of its intention to end the union's collective bargaining rights agreement arguing that only a minority of the enlarged company's 4400 employees nationwide were AEEU members ADT was bought last year by Tyco International the US industrial and service conglomerate However the union said it had only ever represented the engineers who install and maintain security systems and with 823 members it had a majority of the 1500 employees in that category The dispute highlights a key issue concerning the government's commitment give a legal right to union recognition how to define the bargaining unit or relevant workforce amongst whom unions must secure majority support to qualify for recognition rights The Confederation of British Industry wants the bargaining unit to be based on existing business structures while the Trades Union Congress wants to consider the wishes of the workforce and whether groups of employees do similar work Unions fear that previously unionised groups could lose recognition if they are balloted along with non-union employees Ken Jackson general secretary of the AEEU said Companies such as ADT clearly feel they have nothing to fear from the new recognition legislation Their attitude is 'laws may come in but they won't stop us doing what we want to do' Any new recognition needs to be definitive otherwise where ADT is trying to lead the worst of employers will follow  ADT said only that it had been in discussion with the AEEU and continued to seek dialogue with the union on a range of subjects The company's AEEU members will be balloted next week on industrial action The union has also urged its 23 sponsored Labour MPs to lobby the government ,3

2002-04-29, Israel's stock market has dropped 34 per cent since Ariel Sharon visited the al-Aqsa mosque in autumn 2000 and the Palestinians launched their latest intifada  The American Depositary Receipts of Israeli companies listed on US exchanges have shed about 40 per cent in that period But the declines seem to reflect investors' sector preferences rather than geopolitical concerns say analysts Even after Palestinian groups stepped up their suicide bombings and Israeli troops moved into the West Bank Israeli stocks have under-performed US peers by only the smallest of margins Israeli equities suffered from the Nasdaq meltdown more than the recent conflicts said Shaul Eyal an analyst at CIBC World Markets Most US-listed Israeli companies were technology-related with offices production facilities and customers around the world he explained These are global companies agreed Adam Rosen of KSCA Public Relations Worldwide which handles investor relations for several Israeli companies It's not the political crisis that's keeping their stocks depressed  The escalating violence has however spooked some US investors Israeli stocks which had begun to trade on par with American competitor shares in late 1999 and early 2000 are being discounted again by 15 to 20 per cent in some cases according to Mr Eyal But only a few sales have been in direct response to the Israeli-Palestine conflict he said Most investors have assumed that the impact on business will be negligible Nearly all US-listed Israeli companies raised money in the good old days of the tech boom so they have strong balance sheets said Mr Eyal Sales may have slowed as a result of the global economic downturn but research development and production continues The airports are open the seaports are open    There has been no slowdown in productivity as a result of the Palestine conflict he said Mr Rosen said that none of his clients had offices or plants located in Israel's danger zones and that the companies could easily operate from outside the country if their domestic facilities were out of commission Personnel is a minor issue Employees and even top executives including the president of Optibase and the chief executive of Aladdin Knowledge Systems have been called to serve brief stints in the Israeli army reserve since the intifada began But this is part of life in Israel Mr Rosen said Neither the recalls nor the psychological impact of terrorist threats have prevented executives from adhering to their regular globe-trotting schedules Mr Rosen said In fact five of his clients will soon launch US roadshows and he expects a positive reception from US investors who he says have grown more comfortable with the crisis even though it has worsened When it first began in the fall of 2000 my phone was ringing off the wall he explained But now the issues have been fleshed out    and people realise that business is able to go on and the problems are in certain isolated areas  Americans learnt a lesson from the September 11 attacks as well he said It went a long way towards steeling people here against assuming the worst for business By and large it's business as usual ,2
2002-06-29, Stock markets are plunging amid squeals of alarm so is there an answer to low interest rates and poor share performance In the past eight months the FTSE 100 index has fallen by more than 9 per cent If instead of investing your savings in shares you had played safe and deposited in an instant access building society account you would have earned just over 2 per cent interest in those eight months Remember too that inflation although quite low at the moment is always eating away at your nest egg You're probably wondering by now if I've anything to say beyond recording the extent of the current misery I certainly have Despite the poor performance of the stock market over the past three years I believe stocks and shares are still the best long-term home for your savings Of course you must always keep a reserve of cash immediately available for emergencies but the bulk of your savings will perform best if it is invested in the stock market I can hear your reaction Invest in something that has lost 9 per cent in the past eight months and 30 per cent in the past two years That is indeed what I am saying but with a proviso You must make your share investments work for you I recommend using traded options in conjunction with share purchases I'm no better at picking shares than the next person and probably my results would be just as bad as that of the FTSE 100 index But I haven't lost money through my share investments In fact my share portfolio is showing a profit of over 4 per cent over the past eight months Not brilliant perhaps being equivalent to only 6 per cent profit in a full year but not so bad in a year when share prices are collapsing Furthermore because of my exposure to the stock market when the share recovery eventually comes as it always does my portfolio will zoom up in value probably approaching the target of 20 per cent a year that I can usually achieve in good times The only traded option I am considering is the sale of call options options to sell on shares I already own There are other options available but I won't burden you with too much detail Here is a simple example 1000 BT shares at their typical recent price of 250p would cost £2537 to purchase If I now sell an October 260 call option in BT I will receive £183 from the buyer of the option If in October the price of the BT shares is above 260p the purchaser can buy the shares from me at 260p If this happens I will have made £100 profit on the shares plus £183 profit from the option sale That is a total of £283 a profit of 11 per cent in just four months Of course if BT shares were below 260p in October there would be no point in the purchaser exercising his option and it would expire In this case I would have pocketed £183 option money which represents a return of 7 2 per cent in the four months and I would then be able to repeat the process by selling another call option Even though I have sold a call option in the stock I will still receive any dividends that are due So selling the option simply boosts the performance of my share investments If you would like to see how to use traded options have a look at the InvestorProfit site Every share and option trade is listed there and a guide to traded options is available through the site www investorprofit com,2
2002-06-29, Al Gore might be showing every indication of making another bid for the presidency but a core group of his campaign staff from 2000 say they are likely to sit out a second round Although Mr Gore has not publicly stated any intention to run the former vice-president has been laying the groundwork for a new campaign at recent Democratic events speaking at both the Florida and Wisconsin state Democratic conventions His next few months are likely to be spent shaking hands and kissing babies attending fundraisers and speaking at political events all to make sure that big-money donors will be there if or when he needs them Mr Gore's daybook until recently designed to maximise time with family and away from politics will keep the politician's schedule packed morning to night with telephone calls with advisers lunches to woo top Democrats and maybe even appearances on the late-night comedy circuit And that would all be before the real campaign begins To make sure the party and its fundraisers remember him as he plans for 2004 Mr Gore is this weekend hosting potential donors at a strategy retreat in Memphis Tennessee heightening speculation that he is starting his pre-campaign campaigning But the campaign workers who helped bring Mr Gore just inches from the presidency in 2000 are now scattered throughout the country having set up consulting firms rejoined law practices and launched new businesses everywhere from San Francisco to Washington Several have said it would be hard to surrender their new calmer lives for the pressure and long hours of a presidential campaign A lot of people say you should do it but do it once said Chris Lehane a former senior Gore communications aide The level of energy and enthusiasm required to work on any presidential campaign is draining Mr Lehane set up shop in San Francisco joining the crisis management firm started by Mark Fabiani Mr Gore's former deputy campaign manager before he joined the presidential campaign Mr Fabiani himself has returned to La Jolla where he runs a business hired by Governor Gray Davis during the state's energy crisis Mr Fabiani and Mr Lehane are now helping the San Diego Chargers in the football team's bid for a new stadium Like his partner Mr Fabiani said his days of high-intensity campaigning are probably over Doing a presidential campaign is quite a sacrifice Mr Fabiani said It was hard for him to envisage packing up and shipping out to campaign headquarters again where you basically work 20 hours a day But more and more politicians and analysts including some of his former staff predict that Mr Gore will run in two years speculation boosted by the forthcoming Memphis retreat It's obviously a topic of conversation I think most people assume he will run again Mr Lehane said However Ron Klain a former aide who returned to the Washington law firm O'Melveny and Myers after the Florida recounts would not speculate on Mr Gore's plans although he acknowledged it was a topic of conversation among the Gore campaign alumni network that stretches from coast to coast Should Mr Gore run the loss of his top advisers from 2000 would probably mean the promotion of mid-level workers from his last campaign Former Gore staff members predicted some might be motivated to follow Mr Gore again because of the sting left behind by the close margin by which they lost the election after the Florida recount That could stimulate some people to get back into it to try to right a wrong Mr Fabiani said Mr Gore will be entering a crowded Democratic field one dominated by senators including his 2000 running mate Joe Lieberman Mr Lieberman has promised that if Mr Gore runs again he will stay out of the race himself At the same time the Connecticut senator has said publicly that he too is seriously exploring a potential bid for the White House Democratic leaders in the Senate including majority leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina have also indicated that they are investigating runs for the presidency introducing even more competition for the party's nomination After the forthcoming November midterm elections potential candidates will in all probability start rounding up a team to see them through the two years of campaigning it takes to get to a presidential election Though Mr Klain said he probably would not head to Nashville for a campaign again he did say that he would help out Mr Gore in some fashion I think I've done my time in Nashville he added Mr Lehane may be successful and content with his new life out west but as the campaign nears he admits it may get harder and harder to turn down a second chance on a presidential campaign After all he said my passion has always been politics ,3

2002-06-22, National Air Traffic Services last night submitted details of a proposed financial rescue package to the Civil Aviation Authority including a capital injection of £100m and a reduction in charges to its airline customers Opposition from the CAA the economic regulator for Nats' monopoly en-route air traffic control business and from international airlines has forced Nats to make drastic changes to the application filed in February The CAA said last month that Nats' request for big price rises was unjustified The latest package envisages a price regime covering the next eight years to 2010 rather than the three re-maining years of the current price cap period to 2005 It would involve modest price reductions in real terms during the whole period although less than those imposed by the CAA Nats has been battling to cope heavy debts a legacy of its controversial part-privatisation last year and a big drop in expected traffic In the year to the end of March Nats made a loss of about £80m Revenue for the six months from October to March was 17 per cent below budget while traffic was 12 per cent lower than forecast The proposed package includes the injection of £100m in fresh capital This would be provided equally £50m each by the government which holds a 49 per cent stake in Nats and by BAA the UK airports group BAA will become a shareholder alongside the Airline Group a consortium of seven UK airlines which owns a 46 per cent stake and has management control Of each tranche of £50m only £5m will be provided as ordinary share capital the balance of £45m will be invested as subordinated loan capital This was chosen to guarantee BAA a return on its investment of about 8 per cent a year the ordinary shares are unlikely to earn dividends for the foreseeable future The final element in the package involves concessions being made by Nats' four commercial bank lenders Halifax Abbey National Barclays Capital and Bank of America Nats is negotiating to change the repayment profile on its 20-year £730m loans to push more of the burden into the later years It also needs changes to loan covenants to unfreeze the £690m capital expenditure loan facility needed to modernise and increase capacity The CAA is expected to make a decision by August ,2
2002-06-19, Tom Black chief executive of Detica yesterday sought to distance himself from the IT company's poorly received flotation by delivering an annual operating profit increase of 25 per cent as the market expected Shares in Detica the only technology company to have braved the new issues market so far this year have been lingering under their issue price of 400p since they started trading in London seven weeks ago They closed up 6{1/2}p at 339p valuing the business at £75 7m Mr Black said We don't control the share price but we control the company  He added I think UBS Warburg the investment bank that took Detica public did a proper job   Responding to complaints from fund managers who took part in the offering Mr Black said he was confident the value of their stakes would rise in the long term The shares have fallen because the market has fallen Detica itself has not changed nor has its trading  Full-year operating profits rose from £4 68m to £5 84m on turnover of £32 8m £26 6m for the year to March 31 Pre-tax profits after flotation expenses of £1 47m fell slightly from £4 68m to £4 44m Earnings per share after exceptionals fell from 26 9p to 16 9p Comment  Tom Black cannot be blamed for the 15 per cent fall in Detica's share price since it floated end-April But he will be when the business stops delivering on expectations Detica has done relatively well in the current environment because it focuses on advising companies on how to cut their IT expenses and helps them make the most of their existing systems Detica which designs IT systems for the UK government's intelligence databases is also set to benefit from a sustained rise in spending on national security But there is concern the group will struggle to raise its consulting fees or the productivity of its engineers near-term This means its margins can be expected to remain stagnant at best It is now clear Detica came to the market at too high a price since the 400p issue price put it on a prospective p/e of about 18 times while many of its peers traded on comparative ratios of 12-14 times After yesterday's share price rise it is on a p/e of 14 times on UBS's pre-tax profit forecast of £7 39m for the year Investors who own the stock must be patient ,2
2002-04-10, CONGLOMERATE US GROUP TO PLACE SERIES OF TV AND NEWSPAPER COMMERCIALS FOLLOWING FAILED TAKEOVER BID FOR HONEYWELL General Electric is launching its first ever corporate advertising campaign in Europe to improve its image following the failed takeover bid for Honeywell The $43bn deal was blocked last year by the European Commission which was concerned at the US group's increasing dominance of European markets Now GE executives believe they need to convince opinion formers of their European credentials with an extensive series of television and newspaper commercials The ads are expected to stress the role of GE's 70000 European employees with images of a range of positive products including medical imaging machines for pregnancy scans and light bulbs used to floodlight soccer matches News of the campaign was greeted with scepticism in Brussels where many still regard GE as a US company with too much dominance in European markets It will take more than a charm offensive to change attitudes said one person involved in the GE/Honeywell case However those behind the idea believe that they can raise the profile of GE by tailoring the message expressly for Europeans GE generates annual revenues of ~28bn $24bn in Europe but is unlikely to include such figures in the ads In America you can tell everyone you make billions of dollars and they're impressed said one advertising executive That just won't wash over here  GE stressed that the campaign co-ordinated by M&C Saatchi was not just a simple response to the Honeywell setback but part of a wider push for recognition of its European achievements We recognise the need to raise awareness of GE and we'll be working with M&C Saatchi to reach key audiences in support of our ambitious growth plans said Nani Beccalli GE's newly appointed chief executive for Europe GE is part of the fabric of Europe added Tim Duffy managing director of M&C Saatchi We need to raise the awareness of the important role it plays  The new emphasis on Europe including a regional head office in Brussels is something of a departure from the macho management style pioneered by GE's former chief executive Jack Welch who believed in structuring the business along product lines to keep regional bureaucracies to a minimum ,1
2002-06-12, US federal regulators are accumulating evidence that the gaming of the Western power market in 2000-2001 extended well beyond Enron and they show no signs of letting up while profits and stock values are melting down Though it is still committed to electricity privatisation the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Ferc has concluded that the creation of competitive electricity markets across the nation will go nowhere unless it is able to restore public confidence in deregulation We have begun the mother of all investigations Nora Mead Brownell a Ferc commissioner told Western regulators this week Even as she spoke Ferc was preparing to send investigators to examine gas-trading data gathered by the Williams pipeline and trading company in Tulsa Oklahoma Ferc is wielding the strongest weapon at its disposal in its probe It told Williams and three other companies Avista Corporation El Paso Electric Company and Portland General Electric Company PGE that they could lose their authority to charge market-based rates rather than cost-based rates unless they submited more information by Friday Other companies could also be singled out for further data requests The four were among more than 150 companies which were required to submit sworn affidavits that they had not engaged in the same tactics Enron allegedly used to manipulate prices during California's energy crisis Like other energy companies Williams has lost much of its share value this year and has been forced to restructure It said it had found only two financial swap transactions for California gas with El Paso Corporation that may have facilitated a dubious trading tactic with that counter-party On Monday Mirant denied wrongdoing alleging that the discussions were legal appropriate and within the rules of the Western power market El Paso Electric a small Texas utility denied any knowledge of manipulative trading strategies even though Enron manned its trading desk for 75 per cent of the time In one letter it said it had received $7 3m of revenue from joint transactions with Enron during June 2000 alone However in its affidavit it claimed to have earned a mere $700000 from Enron-related transactions El Paso swore that it had no knowledge of Enron's trading tactics This simply is not credible Ferc said PGE admitted that it had taken advantage of the price spread between the California market and the market outside Ferc said But it did not identify the transactions According to the New York Times Xcel a power company turned over transcripts of several conversations that took place in 2000 with one of its traders and a counterpart at Southern Company Energy Marketing now Mirant where tactics were discussed to overschedule nonexistent power and then take payments for relieving congestion ,2

2002-06-29, Bill Miller manager of the US LeggMason Value Trust says this week's revelations about WorldCom the US telecommunications company are another sign of the lack of integrity of US corporate accounts It is not enough for the SEC to say that if executives break the law they will go to jail There is nothing new in that he said The SEC needs to demonstrate that the practice of hiding expenses to make the income statement look better is unacceptable in any form  The round of high-profile corporate scandals in the US has highlighted systemic bad practice he says which is important for investors everywhere Unless we deal with some of these issues the next bull market will be postponed  As a big investor in the US the largest fund Mr Miller runs is worth $11bn he wants to exert pressure on companies to improve their financial statements and standards of corporate governance Corporate America needs to be shown that lobbying and pressure tactics to prevent honest accounting will no longer be tolerated Mr Miller says It is the obsession with reported earnings and the stock price that motivates much of the dishonest behavior we have seen  Mr Miller believes directors of public companies in the US pay scant regard to the interests of their owners the shareholders He reserves most of his ire for the ease with which US companies award large slugs of share options to directors and chief executives without any performance targets attached This is meant to give them a stake in a rising share price but many executives use the options as a get-rich-quick scheme The argument is that giving options to directors allies their interests with those of shareholders but this creates a conflict of interest when they sell  He points to the large share sales by executives such as Ken Lay former chief executive of Enron the bankrupt energy trader and Bernie Ebbers former chief executive of WorldCom the stricken telecommunications group before problems at the companies were uncovered Mr Miller would like to see chief executives and directors required to hold on to their share options while they are employed at the company Citibank has adopted mandatory stock options holding periods he says He arrived in the UK from Baltimore on the day the newspapers were in a furore about executive pay at Vodafone But Mr Miller is unfazed by the large stock options package granted to Sir Chris Gent chief executive of the phone company At least in the UK chief executives' share options schemes have some type of premium price or relative performance trigger    it's not just for being in the chair and seeing the stock drive higher  He believes standards of corporate governance in the UK are higher than in the US but does not subscribe to the view that company leaders should be paid a lot because of the competitive international market for them The argument that so few people out there can do that job is total baloney  Ironically when Mr Miller was first involved in fund management 15 years ago he argued that executive pay was too low Now I'm outraged at the excess with these vast pay packets unrelated to results  He believes that one way of making directors more accountable would be to charge for stock options packages honestly by running them through the profit-and-loss statement If companies are allowed to keep option expenses off the income statement it is no wonder Worldcom thought they could keep operating expenses off the income statement  Mr Miller's focus is anything but short-term and he has held many of the shares in his portfolio for over 10 years He has used periods such as the current shake-out in the US corporate sector to look for companies with an intrinsic value that is not reflected in their share price That is why he owns stock in Tyco the conglomerate that has recently seen its chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski indicted for tax evasion Tyco has a variety of diverse businesses lots of assets and free cashflow  Mr Miller is not ignoring the company's problems But we have tended over the years to get our best results from companies going through some type of problem or scandal he adds The Legg Mason Value Trust is a very concentrated fund with some 35 shares and the average holding period is seven years The trust has outperformed the Standard & Poors 500 index of US shares every years for the past 10 years Mr Miller's investment style is a hybrid of that used by traditional value investors he does a lot of research to work out a company's future free cashflow He also thinks the distinction between value and growth investing is twaddle It's a unique portfolio    I don't suppose there are many value investors who would own both GM General Motors and Amazon com  He is the largest shareholder in Amazon the online store after Jeff Bezos the company's founder and says he has always believed in its highly disciplined approach to financing A year ago everywhere I went people asked me how I could own a company about to go bankrupt but this year they have generated over $10m in cash  Mr Miller's team of researchers can be reviewing 200 companies at any one time but a trigger for more in-depth analysis is an event such as an unexpected fall in the share price He is interested in companies with a sustainable competitive advantage and the ability to earn above their cost of capital This puts him off most capital-intensive commodity industries such as mining paper airlines steel and oil The trust holds two UK companies Lloyds TSB the banking group and WPP the advertising group He believes that UK companies are better at rewarding shareholders with dividends In the US companies are more likely to buy back their own shares which also increases the value of directors' share options This is the heart of the problem boards are not taking seriously their fiduciary duties to owners  Mr Miller says that in spite of the two-year downturn in the market many shares are still overvalued He believes long-term returns from equities are more likely to be from 6 per cent to 8 per cent But the real issue is who gets that rate of return  In his opinion too much is going to directors and managers in the form of stock options If the return to shareholders is only 3 per cent to 5 per cent he argues there is almost a premium for holding bonds He has invested some of his own money in corporate bonds There is a dearth of buying in overall equity market rallies    investors are saying  'If I buy corporate bonds management can't steal that return from me' ,2
2002-06-28, Eurozone money supply growth accelerated strongly last month adding to European Central Bank worries that inflationary risks in the 12 nation bloc are on the rise M3 money supply expanded at an annual rate of 7 8 per cent in May up from April's 7 4 per cent well above the ECB's medium-term target of 4 5 per cent The less volatile three-month moving average the ECB's preferred measure of money growth rose to 7 5 per cent from 7 4 per cent Economists said the stronger-than-expected data were disturbing and would reinforce the central bank's concerns that price pressures were increasing M3 which ECB policymakers use to gauge future inflation rates had been expected to show a decline Economists said a clear pick-up in private sector credit growth closely watched by the ECB was a further worrying signal It rose from 5 1 per cent to 5 3 per cent in May ending a recent slowdown in credit demand But Ernst Welteke the Bundesbank president and a senior member of the ECB's governing council said the unexpected rise in M3 was no cause for concern It is a sign of ample liquidity    but I don't see any risks there at the moment he said M3 growth rates have been running well above the ECB's target level for more than a year The bank has sought to play down their significance insisting they reflect the investor preference for liquid assets given the current economic uncertainty But alongside its more hawkish rhetoric on the inflation outlook in recent weeks the ECB has signalled it is now paying much closer attention to monetary data In the June monthly bulletin it said money supply growth was starting to point to upward risks to price stability Nigel Anderson of RBS Financial Markets said the bad set of M3 figures suggested investor preference for liquid assets remained high As a result M3 growth was unlikely to be tempered any time soon If money growth shows no sign of easing in the near future then economists believe the ECB under pressure from monetarists on the governing council will move to tighten monetary policy The rapid appreciation of the euro against the dollar and the damping effect it has on inflation might delay a rate rise said one analyst But it will not put one off indefinitely  The ECB which meets in Luxembourg next week is expected to maintain its wait and see policy stance holding rates at 3 25 per cent But most economists believe the bank will raise rates in the fourth quarter ,2
2002-06-24, From Mr Duncan Green Sir In reply to the mass lobby of parliament by 12000 supporters of the Trade Justice Movement on June 19 the prime minister's spokesman informed lobby correspondents that Tony Blair essentially agreed with their aims Nothing could be further from the truth Negotiations on international trade rules are currently dominated by two mutually incompatible approaches At different times the UK government espouses both and both are bad for development In public northern governments argue that liberalisation is good for all sectors in all countries whatever their stage of development This is belied by just about every successful economic development episode in history In Kicking Away the Ladder Cambridge economist Ha-joon Chang shows that since the days of Edward III liberalisation has been an end result of successful development not a cause In practice however powerful governments adopt a you liberalise we subsidise attitude to the developing world nowhere more so than in agriculture where northern double standards are beginning to undermine the entire World Trade Organisation process The Catholic Agency for Overseas Aid has seen the results on the ground dumping of artificially cheap crops from northern agribusiness wiping out millions of small farmers in developing countries The Trade Justice Movement is arguing for dare we say it a third way Developed countries should open their markets Developing countries should be encouraged to adopt trade policies that combine liberalisation protection and government support in the right balance for their own development needs If Mr Blair does indeed agree with this approach his negotiators at the WTO have yet to hear about it Duncan Green Trade Policy Adviser Catholic Agency for Overseas Aid Cafod London SW9 9TY,3
2002-04-01, Ministers were last night accused of trying to conceal talks to sell Consignia's core Royal Mail business to TPG the privatised Dutch postal group Insiders close to the discussions said TPG had proposed an all-share takeover of Royal Mail but talks had broken down two weeks ago and were completely dead The news is in contrast to a statement given on March 21 in which the government denied it had been talking to an overseas bidder Lord Sainsbury in response to a question from Baroness Miller in the House of Lords said I have no indication that any negotiations have ever taken place on that  The talks with TPG are understood to have been initiated by the government but were abandoned in favour of plans to cut 15000 jobs as a first step in reducing Consignia's 220000 workforce by up to a fifth over the next three years The group is losing £1 5m a day and is expected to come under pressure over plans to end its monopoly John Whittingdale Conservative trade and industry spokesman said the news would cause more unease among Labour backbenchers who have raised doubts about the restructuring This is a further demonstration of the failure of the structure proposed for the postal service I will be tabling further questions to get to the bottom of this  The takeover talks are understood to have been called off because of government unease about foreign ownership and TPG's uncertainty about support from the unions Ministers are understood to have favoured a joint venture but TPG wanted a controlling share TPG had also wanted to introduce new productivity standards and ways of working The Department of Trade and Industry said it was entirely logical that Consignia had been considering its future There had been no attempt to cover up the talks Lord Sainsbury set out the position as he was aware of it There were only a limited number of people aware of the discussions because they were commercially confidential  www ft com/consignia,1
2002-06-25, Hong Kong's chief executive Tung Chee-hwa yesterday unveiled a new ministerial system in the most comprehensive restructuring of the government since the former British colony was returned to China in 1997 Five people from outside government including a university vice-chancellor an environmental consultant and the chief financial officer of the largest local telephone company and nine existing officials form a new tier of principal officials They are expected to help Mr Tung who begins a second five-year term on July 1 champion government policies Hong Kong which is beginning to climb out of its second downturn in four years is struggling in the face of record unemployment and the bursting of a property bubble in 1997 Although Mr Tung enjoys a strong relationship with Beijing and was handpicked by China to lead Hong Kong he has yet to build a rapport with the former colony's population Opinion polls show that most people did not support his bid for a second term but he was elected unopposed earlier this year because he had been repeatedly endorsed by Beijing Louise Tam 50 a housewife said yesterday I wouldn't have very big hopes for the new ministers Many of them are not civil servants and are not even politicians  The new tier of officials which Mr Tung has dubbed an accountability system is expected to formulate and articulate government policy leaving the civil service to implement it Yesterday the chief executive promised a government that would be transparent enlightened and progressive Because the new officials will not be approved by the legislature and cannot be removed by it the system has been criticised as being a backwards step in the move towards democracy Under Hong Kong's constitution it must decide whether to move to a system under which the chief executive and the legislature are all elected by a conventional universal suffrage system by the end of 2007 This ministerial system has nothing to do with accountability to the public It has nothing to do with democracy said Joseph Cheng a professor of political science with the City University of Hong Kong Basically Tung wants a group of people who are accountable to him  Differences over the system which was proposed by Mr Tung in October 2000 are believed to have been a factor in the resignation last year of Anson Chan popular head of the civil service since 1993 and in the retirement at the end of this month of Lily Yam the fiesty head of the environment and food department Shiu Sin-por the head of a local think-tank said that Mr Tung deserved credit for attracting people from outside the civil service In addition to the five newcomers announced yesterday the finance justice and health secretaries are not from the civil service I don't think anyone can say this is old wine in new bottles said Mr Shiu Additional reporting by Justine Lau,3
2002-06-28, More than 10000 victims of pensions mis-selling are still awaiting offers of compensation just days before the final deadline for all payments to be made The Financial Services Authority warned yesterday that it would take action against financial advisers who failed to sort out their backlog of mis-selling as it said the scandal had already cost £13 5bn In total £11 5bn of compensation has been offered to 1 6m people wrongly persuaded to buy personal pensions in the late 1980s and early 1990s Pension providers and financial advisers have spent £2bn on administration of the reviews creating a mini-industry specialising in compensation payments Many of the staff being released from the pensions inquiry are finding jobs assessing payments to those mis-sold top-up pensions known as free-standing additional voluntary contributions This review is expected to lead to £330m of compensation and cost the industry £80m in administration The FSA said yesterday that financial advisers were lagging furthest behind with personal pension compensation with only 77 per cent of the low-priority cases of small IFAs cleared up Larger IFAs and networks of advisers have finished 89 per cent of cases while banks and life assurers are 99 per cent complete In total 98 per cent of cases have been dealt with We are expecting most firms to be finished by September the regulator said But it warned it reserved the option of imposing fines on those who failed to work on their cases So far 346 companies or advisers have had action taken against them by the watchdog during the inquiry with total fines of almost £10m The regulator said 54000 victims of mis-selling by companies that had gone bust or stopped trading had been compensated by the industry scheme and another 30000 were being assessed Life assurers are delighted that the long-running review is finally drawing to a close It has been a huge task said the Association of British Insurers We are pleased that for most companies we are finally at the end of the process ,2

1998-04-02, Publication of the government's transport white paper previously due in the second half of May is not now expected until mid-June because of the complexity of the issues involved and the difficulty of resolving conflicting interests The white paper is expected to be a fairly brief document setting a framework for plans for the integration of transport policy transport groups said Much of the detail will be contained in up to a dozen supplementary papers many of which would be published after the white paper The point about the white paper is that it is the start of a process not the end of it said an official spokesman for John Prescott the deputy prime minister Separate documents on the roads programme and the future of the bus and shipping industry will be published later in the year A delay of a few weeks is not significant in the context of long-term transport planning the last comprehensive transport white paper also from Labour was published in 1968 ,3

1998-04-03, The long awaited announcement of the winners of one of Europe's largest defence projects was thrown into confusion yesterday after a last minute intervention by the French government Germany France and the UK were due to reveal yesterday who had won the tender to build the battlefield taxi a contract with potential orders of up to £6bn However the press conference was cancelled at the last minute after a diplomatic row between the French and their UK and German counterparts A consortium comprising two German companies Krauss-Maffei and Rheinmetall together with GKN of the UK is widely known to have won the business However celebrations were put on hold after the French complained that their bid did not provide enough work for GIAT the leading French armoured vehicle builder The French government has now asked for a two-week delay to renegotiate the contract and to provide more work for French businesses The hold-up is not expected to change the outcome of the bid The winning consortium will almost certainly try to offer GIAT enough work to defuse the argument The UK Ministry of Defence said The delay is not due to a disagreement about the outcome of the tender It is a diplomatic issue  This is not the first controversy over the battlefield taxi contract The losing consortium which includes Henschel of Germany and Vickers and Alvis of the UK has been fighting a strong rearguard action to try to reverse the decision because the winning bid included plans for an eight-wheeled vehicle while the original specification had asked for only six wheels Some observers say the decision has been partly motivated by German political desire to position Krauss-Maffei at the heart of the consolidation of the European land systems defence industry ,3

2002-06-18, It is hard to picture it now but SEI Investments' first business was training managers of a chain of fast food stores that wanted to rival Kentucky Fried Chicken It didn't work out says Al West in a deep southern drawl as he remembers the ordeal of training managers using SEI's computer simulation of a fried chicken restaurant But it forced Simulated Environment Inc which Mr West founded in 1968 while finishing a doctorate at Wharton Business School in Pennsylvania to look for new markets for products modelled on the simulation tests used by trainee pilots So Mr West an aeronautical engineer and fighter pilot manque who admired Douglas Bader the British flying ace as a boy happened upon the world of high finance almost by accident Back then he recalls during an interview at SEI's London offices the US went into recession and the only businesses making any money were the banks He started providing an online real-time system for managing their trust assets That today remains a big business for SEI but it drew the company into pension fund investment and away from simulated environment technology SEI's transition begs a question what is the connection between SEI then and now We started as a technology firm he says and the way we think is the way a technology firm thinks SEI runs multi-manager funds for company pension schemes and it uses technology to help it do so Typically a pension scheme hires SEI to create say a UK equities fund and SEI in turn picks a series of different fund managers and parcels out the pension scheme's money SEI then monitors the fund managers' performance and fires them if they fail to come up to scratch It is now the world's biggest multi-manager with $70bn of funds under management Its closest rival is Frank Russell a US pension fund consultancy that ran multi-manager products long before SEI and also has about $70bn under management SEI used to have a consultancy business following its acquisition of AG Becker in 1983 But even though it gave SEI credibility in the fund management industry Mr West has few fond memories of a business he sold in the mid-1990s He says he faced a serious conflict of interest advising pension funds on the best managers to run their money and at the same time running fund management products He decided to ditch the consultancy business rather than the profitable fund management business We ended up giving it away he says We tried to sell it but we couldn't It wasn't a very good business and we're not good buyers and sellers  Left to concentrate on fund management SEI grew in the US and then internationally expanding into Mexico South Africa and Korea We tried cutting our teeth in these market because we didn't want to make an error in a market such as the UK or Europe he says In the past two years SEI has battled to break into the UK market It has been slow progress It has picked up eight mandates from pension funds with a total of £250m $369 4m of assets under management But Mr West is not worried by the problems facing SEI in the UK Quite frankly it has been less difficult here than it was in the States he says We'd arrive and say to a company 'I'm here to take over your whole pension scheme ' And they would say 'Yeah right you and who' You might have thought that Frank Russell would have warmed up the market But they really hadn't  In the end SEI did win over sceptical executives Mr West's winning argument was that company executives should not be distracted by the day-to-day management of the pension fund It's not critical to the mission of any corporation he says But at the same time if it is not handled properly then it can really get in the way  So far most of SEI's business has come from small and mid-sized companies that have pension funds with up to $1bn of assets These without the money to fully resource their pensions department have seen the merits of a company that offers round-the-clock management of their assets Mr West's ambition is to run the pension funds of some big multinational companies He has not had any great luck yet Some have the 'not invented here' syndrome he says explaining that the big companies can afford to run their own pension departments Others like SEI's work but say there are additional factors that they must take into account Some say 'You do it better than we do but if we said yes we'd be talking about a lot of jobs on the line' he says In the long term Mr West is confident that some of the big corporations will switch to multi-manager investment houses All the trends are in our favour he says In the US the Enron scandal together with the troubles with under-funded pensions following the fall of stock markets is forcing company executives to think twice about running their own pension schemes In the UKa report that puts greater responsibility on the shoulders of pension fund trustees has persuaded some companies to think about outsourcing the management of their corporate pension fund to specialists such as SEI These days you don't want to do everything says Mr West You just can't you can only be good at a few things  It was a lesson Mr West learned long ago when he abandoned an unpromising business as an adviser in the fried chicken trade ,2

2002-06-14, It has been a tough call for the advisers who have been pricing Yell the international telephone directories business Valuations for directories businesses have been marked down as the advertising recession bites and depressed equity markets make any flotation fraught with risk So in a concession to these uncertain times Yell's advisers yesterday announced an indicative price range at the lower end of expectations valuing the company's equity at between £1 8bn and £2 3bn But Yell and its financial advisers have still been keen to paint a rosy growth story in the US There it has been pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy first buying Yellow Book and then McLeod Publishing the two largest independent directories publishers in the country Given the tough regulatory environment in the UK this is hardly surprising Yell has a near monopoly of the UK directories market with an 87 per cent market share well ahead of its nearest rival the Thomson directory This dominant position has led to a tough pricing regime For the next four years Yell must hold its advertising charges within a cap of retail price inflation minus six percentage points The controls are likely to depress revenue growth prospects significantly in the UK and lead to narrower margins Some analysts have estimated UK margins will fall over the four-year period from current levels of 42 per cent to 35 per cent as a result Merrill Lynch which will be Yell's broker after the float is predicting revenue growth in the UK of just 2 per cent a year and annual growth in earnings before interest of 1 per cent over the next few years This is the reason they have not waited any longer for a float said one analyst yesterday Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Apax Yell's venture capital owners know the UK market is not going to grow any more and so they just want to get out he said The UK market is highly significant as it accounts for more than two-thirds of group profits and half of all revenues But things could be a lot worse New developments such as the recent introduction of colour advertising which commands a significant premium over the conventional advertising format is allowing Yell to convert low-paying customers into bigger spenders Typically a colour advert costs 30 to 75 per cent more than a conventional advertisement Yell's imposed price cuts are also helping it add more new advertisers in the UK with total net new customer additions growing at around 15000 annually But Yell believes its strongest prospects for growth are in the US The US directories business is dominated by the regional telecoms operators Independent directories publishers currently only have a market share of 12 5 per cent and following its acquisition spree Yell is by far the largest independent publisher in the US Independent publishers are growing at a faster rate Last year revenue at the independents was up 13 3 per cent compared to just 1 7 per cent for the regionals Most analysts believe there are real prospects for the independents to continue to make substantial inroads particularly given the higher advertising premiums charged by the regional Bell operators In some areas the regional operators are using their larger circulations to charge more than double for comparable rate cards There is also room for Yell to improve its margins in the US as it transfers superior operational efficiencies from the UK Institutional investors were yesterday expressing interest in Yell attracted by prospects of continued strong cash generation In the last financial year the group delivered operating free cash flow of £168m Directories businesses are also attractive because of their relative immunity to recession Ninety per cent of Yell's advertisers are small and medium-sized enterprises that do not tend to cut back on directory advertising even in a downturn according to analysts The only real risk is that advertisers go under But for investors the valuation of the company is crucial with some saying they would only be interested in buying shares if Yell was to be priced at the lower end of the indicative price range We are paying for US growth upfront assuming it is going to be executed perfectly well But there are a few strategic questions about the US and they would need to offer a discount for that said one City investor Another possible cloud on the horizon is BT Group which sold Yell last year The telecoms operator comes out of its non-compete clause with Yell on June 22 allowing it to set up its own rival directories business if it chooses BT has firmly rebuffed speculation that it is seeking to re-enter the directories market but continued speculation can only serve to heighten concerns for potential investors Additional reporting by Astrid Wendlandt,1
2002-06-22, A cathartic sell-off recovery an extended pause for breath but further progress in prospect This was the consensus view of stock market events since September 21 2001 barely four weeks ago But 5000 on the FTSE 100 has proven to be more than just a number Its violation on June 5 has sparked a wave of selling and bearish sentiment that still grips the market Ever more bearish viewpoints have been aired the FTSE will not rise back above 6000 for a decade the FTSE could fall to 3000 Are prospects really so bleak Short-term prospects are not encouraging Macroeconomic fundamentals are supportive but markets have drawn no comfort UK industrial production has recently turned higher and this week saw a fall in the annualised rate of inflation reducing fears of an imminent interest rate rise but investors are not listening The macroeconomic story that does command attention is the prospect of a double dip Investors fear the enduring anomaly of the strong dollar and the large US balance of payments deficit may about to be resolved If investors are no longer prepared to offset the deficit through their appetite for US assets a spiral of capital withdrawal falling equity markets a weaker dollar and downward pressure on consumption and investment could ensue This adjustment process would be exported to the rest of the global economy and the UK would not be immune The lack of recovery in profits at the corporate level has been one reason behind the loss of appetite for US stocks The normal transmission mechanism from economic to corporate recovery appears to have broken down But this argument overlooks the fact that profits typically lag the turning point in the GDP cycle by at least six months In 1991 there was the same discussion of a profitless recovery but it turned out not to be the case said Richard Davidson of Morgan Stanley First-quarter US productivity increased by more than 8 per cent while unit labour costs fell At the aggregate level corporate profits will rebound and reported company profits should follow However even if reported profits do rebound there is the knotty problem of the market valuation attached to those earnings and whether you can even trust the reported numbers in the first place Concerns over corporate governance and accounting standards still abound and credit markets show signs of the continuing strain The number of credit downgrades relative to upgrades in the US rose in the second quarter compared with the first The anticipated recovery in credit quality following the collapse of Enron has yet to materialise The UK is considered to have a less pressing problem on accounting standards but cannot entirely escape US connections Scottish Power dropped sharply on Wednesday on market talk of accounting irregularities at Pacificorp its US business and felt obliged to issue a statement saying that the auditors had signed off on the subsidiary's accounts Investors do not like to pay top prices for dubious quality The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 25 times earnings very high for the start of an economic upturn If there is a fundamental lack of trust in those earnings then Wall Street does not deserve such a valuation UK profit multiples are lower the FTSE 100 currently trades on an historic price-earnings ratio of almost 20 but are still at the high end of historical averages Lehman Brothers this week stated that European equities had fallen to levels offering unconditional value a signal that stocks should outperform bonds in the next six months However relative attractiveness is no longer enough for investors who have endured two consecutive years of decline and are facing the prospect of a third they want the comfort of cheap absolute valuations Cheap is a relative term but it is quite easy to come up with some scary numbers The average historic p/e ratio for the UK total market since 1965 is 13 7 and for the FT30 is 14 3 To bring the FTSE100 into line with these multiples would require a drop to 3250 Hugh Hendry of Odey Asset Management the best-performing manager of long-only European unit trusts last year is firmly in the bear camp He says In a bear market you typically lose the last five years of the bull run We could go back to 1995 levels around 3000 on the FTSE 100  There are two sides to the p/e ratio and a recovery in corporate earnings would go some way to restoring faith in both the economic recovery and stock market valuations The US second quarter earnings season due to get under way in July will play an important role in determining stock market direction over the balance of the summer The omens are not good Mobile telephone maker Nokia and Oracle the world's second largest software maker were among the companies that warned of lower prospective sales this week although there is a natural tendency for companies to play down expectations at this stage of the cycle Calling the bottom too early leads all too often to share price punishment Morgan Stanley's Richard Davidson points out that US profits should show a year-on-year increase for the first time in six quarters and if the macroeconomic recovery continues double-digit earnings growth is possible towards the end of the year But I am concerned that the improvement in the corporate news flow will be too modest and too late to prevent further short-term losses in the equity markets The technical analysts have the September 2001 closing lows at 4433 7 4219 8 intra-day firmly in their sights Valuations are not cheap on an absolute basis sentiment is weak but has yet to reach the extremes seen last year and basic belief in the quality of corporate earnings is lacking I have not embraced the multi-year bear view choosing to believe in a rebound in corporate profitability but struggle to find any near-term bullish catalysts vince heaney@ft com,2

2002-06-06, BAA the UK airports group is expected to announce today that it is in negotiations to take a leading role in the financial rescue of National Air Traffic Services BAA which controls seven UK airports including Heathrow Gatwick and Stansted has emerged as the most likely private sector investor to inject urgently needed equity capital into Nats which is struggling with falling revenues and a heavy debt burden BAA will report its financial results today They are expected to show a fall in pre-tax profits of 7 per cent last year to about £506m before exceptional items The government with a 49 per cent stake in Nats has pledged to match any fresh private sector investment Nats is seeking a total equity investment of between £100m and £130m split equally between the government and the private sector as part of a total financial restructuring package of up to £250m Nats is also in negotiations with the Civil Aviation Authority the economic regulator over its application to raise fees to airlines for flying through UK airspace It must also persuade its banks to unfreeze their previously agreed £690m capital loan facility which is fundamental to Nats being able to fund its planned £1bn capital investment programme to modernise the air traffic control system The CAA disclosed recently that clauses in Nats' loan documents meant that its four banks Abbey National Halifax Barclays Capital and Bank of America may be in a position to decline further draw-downs  It said the banks had inserted a stringent new clause in the loan conditions as part of their recent agreement to provide an emergency £30m short-term debt facility matched by £30m from the government to the end of September The CAA said that in the extreme without a financial restructuring Nats could collapse into administration because of its inability to service its debts and maintain its investments The Airline Group a consortium of seven UK airlines including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic acquired a 46 per cent stake and management control of Nats last July for £50m The airlines are reluctant to provide more equity themselves however and have been seeking new investors The government isadvised by Credit Suisse First Boston and Nats by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney The negotiations with BAA must still overcome key issues about the degree of control it would acquire and how it could ensure a return on its investment The capital injection could be made through a subordinated loan or preference shares ,1
2002-06-12, Wolfgang Schussel the Austrian chancellor has hit back at rightwing critics of the European Union's planned eastward enlargement saying that it would increase not decrease security for EU citizens He rejected claims made by some far-right leaders including Austria's Jorg Haider that the proposed EU expansion from 15 states to 25 in 2004 could cause problems linked to uncontrolled migration In an interview with the Financial Times Mr Schussel said that expanding Europe's zone of stability was better than reinforcing the union's eastern borders Enlarging the European Union by admitting more member states is clearly an advantage to us It brings more security to Austrian citizens because it's not my ambition to be the watchdog of Fortress Europe  Mr Schussel's views on enlargement are particularly important because Austria borders four candidate countries the Czech Republic Slovakia Hungary and Slovenia and he has had to win public support for enlargement earlier than most EU leaders The Austrian chancellor has had to do this while his centre-right People's Party rules in coalition with Mr Haider's far-right Freedom Party on a pro-enlargement platform but with the eurosceptic Mr Haider excluded from government and free to criticise So far Mr Schussel has succeeded with domestic public support for the eastward expansion rising from about one third to two thirds But difficult issues remain to be resolved with the entry negotiations reaching their planned climax late this year and Austria due for general elections in 2003 In the interview Mr Schussel refused to concede political ground to the far-right and denied that issues such as migration refugees and border protection were the far-right's preserve This is ridiculous All these issues are my issues he said Mainstream leaders had every right to address them as the UK's Tony Blair and Spain's Jose Maria Aznar had done he said Mr Schussel added that eurosceptics were wrong to see migration issues as national matters The internal security of Europe asylum refugees migration is one of those policy areas where we clearly need more Europe not less Europe  However Mr Schussel warned he opposed increasing the costs of enlargement to accommodate the financial demands of candidate states for example for the full benefits of EU farm subsidies The EU had set a clear limit in the Berlin Agenda the 2000-06 budget agreement for enlargement costs of 1 27 per cent of their combined gross domestic product he said In fact EU members would not go above current spending levels of 1 1 per cent of GDP he said His words confirm that the last phase of negotiations which concern financial issues would be very difficult Time is also tight especially after EU foreign ministers' decision this week to postpone decisions on agricultural negotiating positions until the autumn after the German election Mr Schussel said he paid more attention to substance than to schedules If decisions were delayed by three months or so that did not matter much But in words that will cause concern among accession candidates the chancellor warned if the negotiations were held up for more than three months beyond December 2002 this could delay ratification Mr Schussel said nobody wanted to hold up or exclude specific countries but if the negotiations were prolonged alternative strategies should be considered meaning admitting candidate states in small groups or individually Mr Schussel said that as far as Austria was concerned great progress had been made with the agreement on labour mobility while other issues such as concerns about the Temelin nuclear station in the Czech Republic and road transport rights across Austria were moving toward solution However Mr Schussel warned Austria still sought a satisfactory answer to the question of the Benes Decrees the laws passed in the former Czechoslovakia which expelled many ethnic Germans and some ethnic Hungarians in the mid-1940s But Mr Schussel insisted that he wanted enlargement to go ahead and include Austria's neighbours Enlargement was not just an expansion of the EU he said but a reunification of Europe including a reunification of central Europe ,3
2002-04-29, The shocks that habitually stall Britain's economy would have a more dramatic impact if the UK went into the eurozone according to research carried out by a leading economic consultancy for the No campaign The research by Oxford Economic Forecasting shows that after eurozone entry the effect of shocks such as a US recession a rise in oil prices or a fall in equity prices would be much more pronounced The government has promised not to recommend eurozone entry unless five economic tests are met Yet the research suggests the economy is in no position to pass them in particular the tests requiring flexibility to cope with economic change and evidence that entering the eurozone would be good for jobs Falls in share prices and US recessions tend to hit Britain harder than the eurozone Recessions hit US import demand an especially important market for British exports Falls in equity prices hit UK consumer spending in particular because Britons are more likely to own shares than their eurozone cousins If Britain were outside the eurozone the Bank of England would be able to cut rates aggressively counteracting the damage If Britain were inside it would have to rely on cuts in the European Central Bank's interest rate which would probably be less sharp OEF said entering Economic and Monetary Union at an exchange rate that overvalued sterling by 10 per cent would cut UK economic growth by 4 2 per cent and increase unemployment by 275000 over three years by leaving British businesses uncompetitive Entering Emu with sterling undervalued by 10 per cent would initially cut unemployment but then push it up as a lack of competition caused inflation again making companies less competitive OEF said reform of the eurozone to bring labour markets and monetary policy more in line with British practices would smooth the shocks to a limited extent The consultancy repeated the argument that any shock that forced the European Central Bank to raise interest rates would have more effect on Britain under the euro than on other eurozone countries because more UK borrowing is based on variable rates George Eustice campaign director of the No campaign said This study underlines the serious dangers of locking into the euro at the wrong rate and giving up control of our economy The euro would lead to a return to boom and bust  Simon Buckby campaign director of Britain in Europe said This report ignores the wider economic benefits of membership  www ft com/euro,2
2002-04-03, When Milan Kucan stands down as president in December he will leave a very different Slovenia from the one he first led 16 years ago When he rose to power it was as leader of the Slovenian League of Communists within a one-party Federal Socialist Yugoslavia He will stand down having served the maximum two permitted five-year presidential terms in an independent multi-party democracy One of his last projects will be to address long-standing national divisions dating back to the second world war In Socialist Yugoslavia that subject was strictly taboo If Mr Kucan's departure were not upheaval enough Janez Drnovsek Slovenia's other dominant political figure may also change roles Mr Drnovsek prime minister almost continuously since 1992 may stand down to seek the presidency He had a kidney tumour removed two years ago and said in October he might have lung cancer An almost simultaneous departure of the pair could be a decisive moment Although Mr Drnovsek's party Liberal Democracy of Slovenia may resist change a new generation of leaders may emerge Cautious Slovenians nevertheless may not be excited Slovenians are conservative people in the sense that they don't like big changes says Miha Kovac an academic and political commentator People will not so much welcome their departure for Kucan and Drnovsek were the symbol of Slovenia's stability On the other hand a lot of people think it's time for new faces and a new approach to politics  Whoever emerges as the new leadership will face no shortage of challenges Existing leaders have failed to convince the public about the government's two primary goals membership of the European Union and Nato Support for both especially Nato has been slipping Economic reform has been patchy and carried out falteringly There is also the surprisingly deep and bitter continuing rift between inheritors of the second world war Partisan tradition and the anti-communist Domobranci Home Guard President Kucan has recently launched an initiative to heal the historical division He says neither side should make excuses or deny their crimes The partisans were communist-dominated while in some cases the Domobranci fought alongside German Nazis and Italian Fascists The division is perpetuated by the divide between centre-right and centre-left parties This division would have been reduced to a lower level long ago if politicians had not kept heating it up all the time Mr Kucan says Yet that historical division continues to show through in perceptions of how fundamentally the political system needs to change Centre-right opposition parties believe that the present political elite contains too many of the communist-era nomenklatura Real progress in economic and other reforms is unlikely until that ends Slovenia is a special case in which the main actors of the previous regime have maintained an extremely active role says Andrej Bajuk leader of the Nova Slovenija party who was briefly prime minister two years ago They have sup ported only a very partial reform  The opposition particularly distrusts Mr Drnovsek's Liberal Democracy of Slovenia the main political representative of Slovenia's post-independence consensus A diverse party with its roots in the League of Communists' youth movement the party emerged as the largest in parliament at elections in 1992 1996 and 2000 Yet others see the LDS's policies as a simple reflection of most Slovenians' cautious attitude to change I think they properly represent this middle-of-the-road Slovenian attitude towards markets the EU and so on says Mr Kovac The people who run the party after Drnovsek will have to be enormously stupid to lose the support they have  The party has shown some signs of strain over Mr Drnovsek's possible departure Jockeying for position last year caused the prime minister to withdraw a promise to stand for president and his candidate for party general-secretary was defeated at a recent conference Nevertheless the LDS whose members range from left-wingers to Christian Democrats has shown a talent for retaining power maintaining comfortable coalitions with parties to its left and right The party currently governs in coalition with the centre-right People's Party the ex-communist United List of Social Democrats and the Pensioners' party When push comes to shove the Slovenians prefer the devil they know to the devil they don't says a Ljubljana-based diplomat Slovenians have a distrust of smart people in other parties who have been educated overseas The LDS has been extremely successful  Mr Kucan is another leader the Slovenians know well Even after so long many Slovenians would it seems be happy to see him continue In a recent opinion poll 40 per cent said they would vote for any party Mr Kucan might found He plays down his own significance however I'm certainly one of those people who has been present in the Slovenian political sphere for a long time he says But I'm not one of those who would overestimate the role of individuals in history That's why my departure or the departure of any other major political figure will not have any negative consequences ,3
2002-06-26, President George W Bush arrived for the G8 summit in Canada yesterday set to focus on one of the administration's key convictions that trade not aid offers the best way up for the poor nations of the world particularly those in Africa But less than two years after Congress enacted a big trade bill to open up US markets to Africa the administration is considering for the first time removing some trade benefits under the act Faced with pressure from domestic fruit growers the US is likely to reimpose a 15 per cent tariff on imports of canned pears from South Africa that was eliminated in 2000 by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act AGOA US growers have petitioned the office of the US trade representative USTR to put the tariff back in place While a USTR spokesman said that no final decision had been made a staff committee has recommended to Robert Zoellick the US trade representative that such a step be taken to protect the small and ailing US canned pear industry The administration is hoping to soften the blow by agreeing at the same time to remove tariffs on South African exports of another product of similar value manganese flakes But the South African government has nonetheless warned Washington that reimposing tariffs on pears would send a very strong negative message to both African and US companies that any commitment provided under the AGOA to build trade relationships and provide incentives can be easily reversed By harming the predictability of commercial transactions the move could undermine investment and trade throughout the region South Africa warned The issue has again highlighted what to US trading partners has become a disturbing clash between its professed commitment to opening trade particularly with poorer nations and a series of decisions particularly on agriculture that will hurt the ability of poor countries to sell to the US The Bush administration has strongly supported the AGOA and wants to see tariffs removed on more African exports to the US Mr Zoellick has called the Africa trade bill a turning point in the US economic relation ship with the region But the system established by Congress allows any disgruntled US competitors to seek protective tariffs if they are hurt by the new African competition The dispute over South African pears shows how easy it has become for even a small US industry to win import relief that otherwise violates a central premise of Bush administration trade policy The US canned pear industry sells about $100m £68 4m {XEU}103m worth of pears each year supporting 1600 growers in California Oregon and Washington Imports make up just 6 per cent of the US market Since the enactment of the AGOA in 2000 the canned pears business has been one of only a handful of South African industries to benefit from the tariff eliminations Pear exports from the country to the US rose from about $1m in 1999 to $2 6m last year representing less than 3 per cent of the US market But US pear producers say that the cheaper South African fruit is stealing their share of a stagnant market The industry is already on life support the largest US canned pear producer is in bankruptcy and the US government spent $83m over the last two years to bail it out by buying canned pears for subsidised school lunch programmes The industry has been also been able to enlist the muscle of its local representatives including Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington state a close ally of the Bush administration who is generally regarded as one of the most committed free traders in Congress While the administration has touted the AGOA as a vast market opportunity for Africa the elimination of tariffs has already been selective in an effort to avoid such domestic controversies In South Africa for instance three of its largest fruit exports canned apricots peaches and mixed fruit were excluded from the outset of the programme Less than 9 per cent of South Africa's clothing exports qualified under the rigid AGOA rules Pears along with edible ice and windbreakers have been the only real South African success stories so far under AGOA according to a recent study by the Trade and Industry Policy Strategies a South African research group ,2

2002-06-27, Crude oil futures fell yesterday amid general unease in the equity markets due to the revelation of what could be the largest accounting scandal in memory WorldCom the second-largest long-distance telecommunications carrier in the US announced late on Tuesday that profits had been overstated to the tune of $3 8bn causing the company to fire its chief financial officer and restate results for the previous five quarters The latest blow to the shaky confidence in the stock markets caused funds to take money out of oil to cover their positions in equities traders said Meanwhile ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna decided to maintain drastic curbs on crude oil output for a further three months dismissing worries of a jump that could take prices above $30 a barrel The Opec decision has been just about the biggest surprise since sunrise this morning the losses have mostly been due to fear that WorldCom would hurt the stock market and general confidence and ultimately ruin the good demand we've been seeing lately said Phil Flynn senior vice-president at Alaron Trading in Chicago In morning trading in New York Nymex WTI had lost 5 cents to $26 27 In late afternoon in London IPE Brent for August delivery was down 30 cents to $24 90 Gold staged a flight-to-quality rally on the back of the weakness in equities and the decline in the US dollar due to the impact of the WorldCom news Comex gold was up 10 cents at $320 60 an ounce around noon having traded in a $326 40-$320 10 range during the morning ,2
2002-06-10, When John Houliston stands up on Thursday to announce Dairy Crest's annual results it will be his last such occasion as chief executive before he retires at the end of July He will have good reason to feel pleased with himself The company's share price is near its all-time high and despite the woes of the dairy industry profits are rising Mr Houliston is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to March up from £57m to £72m According to Michael Landymore food analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite who has followed the company for many years John prepared the company well for flotation in 1996 and has not disappointed investors since especially with the well-timed well-priced and well-executed Unigate dairies deal He leaves the business in much better shape than when he arrived  Indeed when Mr Houliston joined Dairy Crest in 1990 becoming chief executive in November 1991 it was a very different company As the processing arm of the old Milk Marketing Board the government body that bought all the country's milk its job was to relieve farmers of surplus milk they could not sell elsewhere As processor of last resort it was making lowly-priced commodity products And as a subsidiary of a government agency it was bureaucratic and inefficient One of Mr Houliston's first moves as chief executive was to stop production of Lymeswold an ill-fated attempt in the early 1980s to launch a British soft cheese that ended up costing the company millions of pounds More seriously he spent years closing or selling inefficient dairies and making people redundant By the time the company was floated in 1996 following the abolition of the MMB in 1994 he had reduced the number of plants from 32 to 11 and the workforce from 12500 to 3400 Meanwhile Mr Houliston was supervising a push to increase the proportion of business that the group derived from added value products from less than 10 per cent when he arrived That meant expanding production of mature and farmhouse cheddar cheese with brands such as Cathedral City and Davidstow compared with the standard low-margin mild cheddar putting heavy marketing spending behind products such as Clover the dairy spread and launching new ones such as Frijj a flavoured milk drink The flotation was priced at 155p with 29000 farmers taking shares in the company and the shares rose for the next couple of years But there followed some years of frustration as the group battled against fierce competition and overcapacity in its commodity sectors particularly milk while continuing its efforts to expand the higher-margin business Then the share price sank again during the craze for TMT stocks in 1999 and 2000 It was just as Dairy Crest's shares were near their lowest that it made its boldest move buying the milk and cheese business from Unigate and merging it with its own The deal was one step in a much needed industry consolidation that has still to be completed Originally Dairy Crest intended to pay Unigate £220m in shares for the business But it was forced to raise the bid to £250m in cash with a share alternative In the event only 6 3m shares worth £11 6m at the time were issued in connection with the deal with the balance paid from debt The deal has so far fulfilled the promises Dairy Crest made at the time Although it diluted the added value portion of the portfolio reversing much of the work the company had been doing it allowed Dairy Crest to reduce the cost base in its commodity business and concentrate production on fewer larger super dairies Cost savings are still coming through with the current year to March 2003 expected to benefit by £25m from the deal Those few Unigate shareholders who opted for Dairy Crest shares have done well They in effect bought the shares for under 200p and have seen them jump to a recent peak of 566{1/2}p closing last Friday at 541{1/2}p ,2

2002-06-12, British Airways has launch-ed alegal action against American Express in an attempt to stop the card company terminating their commercial relationship after the airline refused to accept credit card payments for some corporate travel deals American Express threatened punitive action against BA last week after the airline stopped paying settlement fees on credit card transactions for corporate net fares in the UK Net fares are private discounted fares that airlines negotiate directly with their biggest business customers BA is trying to slash the fees it pays to third parties as it looks to pull itself round from its worst financial performance since privatisation 15 years ago The airline lost £200m last year and wants to save £100m annually in distribution costs in a £650m cost-cutting plan which will see 13000 jobs go out of 56700 The move has angered travel agents which have been forced to accept a further round of commission cuts BA now risks damaging its ties with American Express The two companies have strong links Almost three-quarters of the top British companies use corporate American Express cards to pay for travel The two also jointly market a co-branded British Airways American Express Card which offers benefits such as BA Miles The situation is further complicated because American Express is the world's largest business travel agency Net fare deals have grown in popularity in the past two years BA has 250 such arrangements which are thought to account for about 40 per cent of its revenue in the UK Companies prefer to book these fares through their travel agents and pay with cards for ease of booking and to help keep track of their travel expenditure Jim Tobin of American Express described the lawsuit which was filed in New York as frivolous and without merit He added BA is in breach of its agreement with us for not accepting the card on all fares in the UK  BA's refusal to pay the card merchant fees means travel agents will now have to pick up the extra cost and in turn pass it on to clients American Express's travel agency last week imposed a 2 per cent service fee on all net fare bookings it handles for corporate clients Many corporate clients are angry at BA's move claiming that it amounts to an indirect price increase BA said it would shed merchant fees on corporate net fares as part of wider restructuring announced in February It claims that separating the merchant fee will help bring greater transparency which will drive down prices First Choice Page 23,2
2002-04-10, A {XEU}450m $396m lifeline from the French government to Bull the struggling computer maker has been thrown into doubt by a European Commission decision to open a formal investigation into the aid The Brussels authorities are to probe whether the loan from the government which owns a minority stake in Bull complies with European rules for state aid to companies in difficulties The move which was expected is a blow for the company and the government of Lionel Jospin which has prided itself on its job- creation record Mr Jospin is running in this month's presidential elections The government granted the bulk of the aid last month amid fears of labour protests if the company which employs 11000 people collapsed However the Commission has up to 18 months to reach a decision and will not rule on the Bull aid before the elections Meanwhile Bull will be able to use the loan which has to be repaid within 12 months An official from the French finance ministry yesterday said We feel that this Commission decision was inevitable considering Bull's past However we are confident about the outcome  The French government which has injected more than {XEU}7bn into Bull since the 1960s will have to convince the Commission that the aid will be used to keep the company afloat and not to pay for job cuts and other restructuring costs Under European rules companies can only receive state subsidies for restructuring once Bull received {XEU}1 3bn in restructuring aid from Paris in 1993-94 Bull said yesterday that the loan would not be used to pay for restructuring costs We believe that we have a solid dossier This is likely to be a lengthy investigation but it should not intervene with our plans since the Commission is not going to ask for the payments to be suspended  Brussels is also concerned that the French aid could simply export the company's problems to other European Union countries as Bull is present in six member states Pierre Bonelli chairman has said Bull would have had to file for bankruptcy without the additional government loan ,3
2002-06-04, The German Christian Democrats would use an election victory in September as a trigger for new initiatives on reviving the eastern German economy according to Lothar Spath the party's designated economics minister Mr Spath said he would establish a special economic zone along Germany's border with Poland and focus government investment promotion on cluster regions with a proven track record Mr Spath has a strong reputation in eastern Germany based on his experience since 1991 as head of the hi-tech company Jenoptik one of the region's most successful enterprises If successful in September Edmund Stoiber the conservative's chancellor candidate has pledged to create a super-ministry for Mr Spath covering economics labour and eastern Germany Mr Spath said in a Financial Times interview I propose creating a special economic zone along the border between Germany and Poland This could be supported by the European Union The zone would include incentives to promote educational institutions and infrastructure projects and measures to ease border crossing The region along the Polish border is one of the most economically depressed in Germany with unemployment rates often more than double the national average Mr Spath's proposal appears to be a modified version of a suggestion earlier this year by Mr Stoiber to amend national laws in order to turn the whole of eastern Germany into a special economic zone The Bavarian premier has since acknowledged the idea was politically unrealistic Mr Spath said a Stoiber-led government would support successful regions within eastern Germany so that there are spillover effects for surrounding areas If implemented this approach would mark a departure from that adopted by the current government and could spark a backlash from poorer eastern German regions Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has backed off from concentrating investment promotion schemes only in successful districts for instance around Leipzig and Dresden because of strong opposition in the east Mr Spath said that spreading government aid thinly across eastern Germany had led to over-capacities in many sectors In weaker regions we would concentrate on setting up small higher education colleges Well trained personnel would attract employers he said Mr Spath a former premier of the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg said a CDU-led government would re-examine aspects of the solidarity pact of special financial transfers to eastern Germany agreed last year The main thrust of the {XEU}156bn £100bn pact which runs until 2019 and represents the government's framework for support for eastern Germany could not be altered he admitted Separately Mr Spath said that on a nationwide basis a Stoiber-led government would consider new options for privatisation These could include for instance the construction and maintenance of public buildings Hospitals and sewerage plants could also be organised on a private basis The federal government could create better incentives to support this The English are far ahead of us on this issue he said ,3
2002-06-28, Politicians have been urged to create a single European market for pensions to avert a looming economic disaster for millions of consumers A report by the European Financial Services Round Table a group of leading insurers and banks says most people remain unaware of the gap between what they expect to receive in retirement and what state pension systems in Europe expect to afford Pehr Gyllenhammar chairman of the group said If the EU and its member states fail to act rapidly and to prioritise change they risk wrecking Europe's proudly and painstakingly achieved social models by failing the pensions expectations of millions of Europeans  Mr Gyllenhammar who is also chairman of CGNU the UK's largest life assurer said the pay-as-you-go pension schemes of several European states could be unsustainable within a few years Further France's existing provision had been widely forecast to collapse by 2007 if it was not fundamentally reformed The report claims European citizens' freedom of movement would benefit from integration of the pensions market It also says the patchwork of national pensions systems imposes unacceptable barriers and often severe taxation costs when people seek to change where they work or live An estimated 5 1m European citizens aged 15 or over live in a member state other than their member state of origin and greater mobility following the enlargement of the EU is expected to increase this number In 1999 the assets of pension funds in the EU amounted to more than {XEU}1970bn £1270bn about three times those accumulated in 1990 However 90 per cent of this amount related to the UK Netherlands and Ireland The report urges the EU to seek a system where pensions contributions are exempt from taxation funds are exempt during the accumulation stage and proceeds are taxed as they are spent It also calls for no discriminatory tax penalties on investing in or consuming pension savings in other EU member states and says new members should have a pensions tax system compatible with an EU-wide system Mr Gyllenhammar said The European Commission argues in favour of more private pension provision To help bring this about Europe's politicians must create a single market in pensions that will increase consumer choice reduce costs encourage take-up of private pensions and go some way to averting the pensions disaster Europe is facing  The report welcomes recent agreement by EU finance ministers for a proposed directive on the activities of the institutions for occupational retirement provision but says adoption of an agreed directive and implementation in national law are urgently needed For more reports see www ft com/globaleconomy,3
2002-06-15, Worried East Anglian pea farmers can sleep easier this weekend after the receivers who closed the Kings Lynn frozen pea factory on Monday said last night they had found a buyer They said they understood the buyer wishes to facilitate some or all of the processing of this year's pea crop Industry experts said the buyer was likely to be Pinguin a Belgian frozen vegetable company possibly in a joint deal with Frigoscandia which operates the cold store on the Kings Lynn site The closure of the Albert Fisher plant with 320 redundancies had come at a particularly bad time as the pea crop is almost ready to be harvested and thousands of tonnes of peas were destined for the Norfolk factory Peas have to be frozen rapidly after harvesting and without a local processor farmers might have had to sell peas for animal feed at much lower prices The plant also makes frozen chips from locally grown potatoes Albert Fisher was put into receivership last month owing more than £100m Joint receivers Mick McLoughlin and Jim Tucker of KPMG said they expected the sale to be completed on Monday They did not disclose a price However observers suggested that since the buyer was taking the plant machinery and property and not buying the business as a going concern the price was likely to be low The receivers to Albert Fisher are thought to have had few offers for the rest of business by yesterday's deadline for bids Industry experts said they thought the receivers would not be able to raise enough to repay the group's £100m-plus debt One bidder for the Albert Fisher group is thought to be Bloomsbury a seafood trading company owned by Albemarle Partners a private equity group It would be interested in Albert Fisher's seafood trading subsidiary Macrae Foods another private equity-owned fish company is thought likely to buy Albert Fisher's fish processing and ready meals businesses in Aberdeenshire and Redditch in the Midlands Also thought to be interested in the fish side is Youngs Bluecrest also a venture capital backed group Bonduelle a French prepared vegetable group is thought to be interested in Albert Fisher's prepared salads businesses Some companies such as Northern Foods which had expressed interest in buying parts of Albert Fisher appear to have lost interest in bidding after they had a closer look at the assets ,1
2002-06-13, Erste Bank Austria's second biggest bank has moved to capitalise on its strong share price by announcing plans to raise at least {XEU}600m $568m of new equity to finance its ambitious attempt to become central Europe's biggest retail bank Erste Bank along with its Austrian rivals was fined {XEU}37 8m yesterday for anti-competitive activities by the European Commission Erste does not believe the decision will have any sustained negative impact on its earnings prospects Erste whose shares have risen 27 per cent this year plans a secondary public offering of at least 8m shares equal to 16 per cent of the total outstanding shares The proceeds will be used to refinance its {XEU}750m acquisition of the minority of Ceska sporitelna the biggest Czech retail bank Erste has been one of Europe's top-performing bank shares this year as confidence has grown in its strategy of transforming itself from a slow-growing Austrian savings bank group and into a fast-growing central European retail bank with a major presence in the Czech Republic Slovakia and Hungary Erste increased net income of its core business by 12 per cent to {XEU}60 5m in the first quarter of 2002 Austria and Central Europe contributed equally to the 23 per cent increase in net interest income to {XEU}384 3m and there was a double-digit growth in commission income The recent strength of Erste's share price combined with increasing evidence of its ability to deliver on what was initially regarded as a highly risky strategy had increased speculation that Erste would soon raise fresh equity Erste's shares which peaked at {XEU}88 45 last month closed at {XEU}76 on Tuesday and were slightly lower in early trading yesterday Last month Erste shareholders authorised the issue of up to 15m new shares While Erste probably needs to issue only around 8m shares to pay for the Ceska sporitelna minority there has been speculation it might be tempted to issue more equity to strengthen its low Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 5 per cent Erste Bank and its savings bank partners have more than 10m customers and Andreas Treichl chief executive says the capital increase will enable Erste Bank to continue its expansion in central Europe He believes Erste Bank shares represent the most promising investment in the financial sector of central Europe JP Morgan has been appointed as global bookrunner and co-ordinator for the share offer ,2
2002-04-18, It is as close as the chancellor could get to a nightclub tax An 11p-per-bottle duty increase on ready-to-drink cocktails such as Smirnoff Ice and Bacardi Breezer is likely to be passed on to drinkers in clubs and bars across the country The government said the surprise move against these designer beverages was partly a response to their use in binge drinking However the Wine and Spirit Association which represents distillers claimed the tax rise would be unenforceable in the long run because manufacturers would simply remove all traces of spirits and make the drinks beer-based instead Led by Smirnoff Ice a vodka-based drink made by Diageo RTDs have been a marketing phenomenon for distillers At about 5-6 per cent alcohol by volume they are roughly the same strength as premium beers Nightclubbers like them because they are portable and can be clutched while dancing Bars like them as they are easier and quicker to dispense than traditional cocktails Their success clearly did not escape the chancellor who decreed that spirit-based RTDs should no longer be taxed as if they were a low-alcohol wine The government said consumption of RTDs more than doubled between 1999 and 2001 Over that same period it said the average pub price of the drinks rose by about 60p a bottle in spite of duty falling in real terms Quentin Rappoport director of the Wine and Spirit Association claimed the tax on a standard 275ml bottle would increase from 18p to 30p an increase slightly larger than the 11p calculated by the government He described the move as a disaster saying it was taxing innovation In the US Smirnoff Ice and its ilk are actually malt-based like a beer to minimise tax bills Mr Rappoport warned that it would be easy for some drinks companies to do the same in the UK denying the chancellor his tax windfall However this might bring its own pitfalls drinks companies in the US have come under pressure from advertising regulators for using glamorous spirits brand logos on what is essentially a flavoured beer Diageo the most prominent manufacturer of RTDs said it was disappointed It said This decision effectively discriminates against these products which opens up a significant gap between them and premium packaged lagers of comparable ABV alcohol by volume levels  The chancellor froze duty on spirits wine and beer The government said duty on spirits was now 34 per cent lower in real terms than it was 20 years ago The Wine and Spirit Association said it was disappointed there was no easing of the duty on sparkling wine which is taxed more heavily than still ,3

2002-06-06, Since the failure of the London-Frankfurt stock exchange merger two years ago hopes for consolidation in Europe's markets have instead turned increasingly to clearing and settlement If front-of-house trading operations cannot be merged perhaps back office operations can This after all is where the bulk of costs lie Clearing and settlement is the work done once a trade has been agreed The two sides' entitlement to their assets needs to be checked and cleared then the actual transfer of those assets is settled similar to the completion of a house sale by a solicitor These two functions can be handled by separate organisations as they are in London by the London Clearing House and Crest or rolled into one as they are at Clearstream which handles German trades Clearing houses also act as a central counterparty CCP standing between the two sides to supply anonymity to a trade removing the risk of one partner defaulting and offering netting of trades so fewer need to be settled at the end of the day They also act as depositories for securities The growth of cross-border European trading accelerated by the arrival of the euro has made more urgent the need to cut clearing and settlement costs Cross-border trades can cost 10 times as much as domestic trades Earlier this year Deutsche Borse owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange took over Luxembourg-based Clearstream in which it already had a 50 per cent stake The move scuppered hopes that Clearstream might merge with Euroclear Europe's other international central securities depository But Europe does not exist in a vacuum and one of the most intriguing questions now is what are the Americans going to do Last December New York's Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation DTCC a veritable giant of the industry formed a bridgehead into Europe with the launch of EuroCCP So far it has had a low profile only handling work for Nasdaq Europe a market that has yet to take off Furthermore the DTCC is keen to play down any suggestion it has aggressive intentions Like many of Europe's central counterparties it is not an acquisition-hungry corporate But its presence has something of the feel of a US aircraft carrier arriving off the coast of a war torn zone Although Europe's many borders tax regimes and legislations make consolidation far more challenging than it was for the US the creation of the euro has raised hopes for further seemingly impossible achievements The sceptics point out that the US miracle did not happen overnight Until 1976 there were seven central counterparties and even after creation of the National Securities Clearing Corporation it was another 15 years before all clearing and settlement was pooled However money is getting in the way Deutsche Borse now a publicly quoted profit-maximising business wanted Clearstream for its revenues Euronext too the merged Paris Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges profits richly from its clearing house Clearnet Of the main three European exchanges only London is not in this position and Don Cruickshank its chairman has been outspoken in his support for a European CCP The horizontal model of London with separate exchange clearing house and settler has been contrasted to Deutsche Borse's vertical silo where all functions are owned by a single business Brussels-based Euroclear which settles trades on Euronext is nevertheless independent of the exchange Spokesman Denis Peters runs through the quirkily named models being proposed for Europe One is the hour-glass model where the neck of the hourglass is a single European clearing house with the CCP processing trades from many exchanges and then sending them on to many settlers An alternative is the Martini glass model where both clearers and settlers are merged as in the US A third option is proposed by Giovanni Sabatini of Monte Titoli the Italian clearing house and chairman of the industry body the European Central Securities Depositories Association He believes Europe should seek not mergers but a network of links to achieve inter-operability putting in place technologies which would allow connections between Central Securities Depositories CSD This predictably is the spaghetti model Stuart Goldtein spokesman for the DTCC reckons inter-operability is more relevant than debates about horizontal versus vertical especially since September 11 Such links would enable CSDs to pass backlogs of work to one another around the world The US has now moved on to a new challenge reducing the time needed to complete a transaction from three days to 24 hours known as T+1 In Europe it can be as much as T+20 although T+3 is more normal The Securities Industry Association of the US says it will cost $8bn to achieve but in return the financial industry will save $2 7bn a year The deadline is June 2005 Paul Walsh at the consultancy Capco says T+1 has been been a topic of discussion for a number of years However since the publication of the SIA T+1 Business Case document in July of last year focus has reached critical mass  He believes Europe needs to be getting ready too Some European institutions are assuming T+1 in the US is simply a domestic matter Those who take this position do so at their own peril ,1
2002-04-12, Staff at Degussa'sDusseldorf headquarters appear slightlyunfamiliar with their building The name Degussa may date back to the formation of modern Germany in the 1870s but the present incarnation of the company has existed for little over a year and moved into its new headquarters only in October The astonishing speed with which a second-tier German chemicals company has become one of the world's largest speciality chemicals groups has left investors and analysts as disoriented as the staff who search for unfamiliar meeting rooms Just 15 months ago Degussa was a conglomerate spanning heavy chemicals healthcare and precious metals Degussa stands for Deutsche Gold und Silber-Scheideanstalt Now it focuses on speciality chemicals such as pharmaceutical ingredients food additives pigments and high-performance plastics And it is set to play a key role in the further consolidation of the sector The only thing the old Degussa and the new Degussa have in common is the name says Utz-Hellmuth Felcht chief executive In two years' time two or three speciality chemicals companies will have gone We want to be a leading player in the consolidation of the sector he says The shape of the chemical industry is changing Once dominated by conglomerates with interests ranging from petrochemicals to pharmaceuticals the sector has largely fragmented into more focused entities in recent years But the newly focused speciality companies such as French group Rhodia and the Swiss companies Ciba and Clariant are finding they do not have the critical mass that used to give their parent companies pricing power As a result investors who originally demanded more focus have seen an erosion of the high margins speciality status was supposed to bring Degussa however stands out While most others have clung to their status as national champions and spurned consolidation Degussa has managed to integrate the most attractive assets of several companies through a series of mergers and acquisitions Meanwhile an ambitious programme to divest non-core businesses with sales totalling {XEU}6bn £3 7bn is set for completion by year-end The flurry of disposals has already raised more than {XEU}3bn Today's Degussa came into being 14 months ago when Veba and Viag the utility groups that owned Degussa-Huls and SKW Trostberg merged to form Eon Europe's biggest listed utility Laporte the UK fine chemicals company was acquired last year for {XEU}1 8bn Mr Felcht formerly the head of SKW says Degussa is better placed than many others in the industry not least because of its new-found size The fact that outsiders also see Degussa playing a role in consolidating the sector owes much to Mr Felcht's willingness to modernise while rivals clung to their industrial pasts Felcht understood the need ahead of some of his competitors in the German chemical industry to be seen as a modern operator in the eyes of the equity markets says one banker That has won him a good deal of credibility Several of Degussa's rivals have considered mergers but none has been consummated Ciba and Clariant aborted their all-Swiss merger in 1998 and last year Rhodia walked away from talks with both DSM the Dutch group and Clariant The companies say the risk of integrating their diverse activities outweighs the benefits but analysts say consolidation is only a matter of time It's about pricing power says Peter Mackie chemicals analyst at Commerzbank Speciality chemicals are squeezed between very large and powerful raw material suppliers and large powerful customers Increasing the range of products they offer gives price and in some cases purchasing power he says Another driver is the smaller size and shorter history of the new speciality companies Few have achieved core holding status among fund managers making the shares more volatile than those of their parents were Speciality chemical companies need not be active in every market segment but they do need global scale Mr Felcht says Five years ago you needed annual sales of at least {XEU}5bn to survive Now I think critical mass is more like {XEU}10bn  Needless to say Degussa is above this level with sales in its core activities up 4 per cent last year at {XEU}10 8bn Last there is constant pressure to update the portfolio because of the short life cycles of many products Whatever speciality chemical companies say about the added values in their products the fact is that many innovative chemicals rapidly become commodities But investors have good reason to be wary of deals The chemicals industry has a record of destroying value by overpaying for acquisitions ICI's $8bn purchase of Unilever Speciality Chemicals for example was originally well received but the debt burden depressed shares and eventually forced an £800m rights issue More recently Clariant and Rhodia have disappointed investors by overpaying for fine chemical acquisitions Moreover the entire chemicals industry has had a difficult year as demand in customer industries such as construction and automotive manufacturing has fallen in response to the economic downturn Degussa itself reported a 19 per cent fall in operating profits last year The structural change it has undergone makes assessing its figures frustratingly difficult But analysts see the young company as one of the strongest in the sector with a 20 per cent higher free cash yield than its peers Its disposals have enabled it to pay down debt arising from among other things last year's acquisition of Laporte With gearing at 52 per cent at the end of 2001 its debt level is higher than German rivals Bayer and BASF but comfortably below the speciality sector average of 74 7 per cent This gives it the leeway to obtain financing for up to {XEU}3bn on the capital markets if it wishes analysts say The company could also choose to further narrow its product range through disposals that would raise additional cash for larger acquisitions says Tobias Mock an analyst at HVB Some 85 per cent of Degussa's core businesses are already in the top three in their respective sectors For those that are not Degussa will seek suitable and feasible acquisitions or internal growth says Mr Felcht The main areas in question are the health and nutrition and speciality polymers divisions he says Degussa's strategy of focusing on specialities is promising says Mr Mock But he cautions that Degussa now has to concentrate on ensuring that the operational side fulfils all the potentials that the strategy holds Jonathan Tyler analyst at Bear Stearns says Degussa must avoid overpaying for businesses it does not understand Degussa has some fairly dominant positions The risk is that they move into new areas to avoid antitrust problems but end up getting the wool pulled over their eyes he says Degussa's aim to reach a 20 per cent ebitda margin in its core operations by the end of 2004 from 16 8 per cent in 2001 is ambitious in a sector where the average is in the mid to high teens So is its aim to achieve annual improvements in profits of {XEU}500m through cost- cutting and synergy effects by 2004 says Mr Mock Degussa shares have bounced 40 9 per cent since it issued a profits warning in October but two uncertainties overshadow the stock First its membership of the Dax index of blue chip stocks is uncertain Membership of the Dax-30 will be determined by free-float from the middle of this year Because 65 per cent of its shares are still in the hands of Eon Degussa will fall ending up in the lower reaches of the index Second and perhaps more importantly Eon has to sell the stake within three to five years of the conclusion of its purchase of Powergen the UK power company in order to comply with US regulatory requirements Until it does so the share overhang remains a worry for investors But Mr Felcht may seek a merger sooner than this A merger could be the first step towards an exit for Eon says one banker Mr Felcht would need the backing of Eon before making any move Eon says it will continue to support Degussa's concentration on speciality chemicals and the restructuring process In the past it has been accused of using Degussa as a vehicle to exit from its chemical businesses with little regard for other shareholders But analysts say the need to divest its stake because of the Powergen acquisition means its interests in Degussa are now aligned with those of the minority holders Only DSM has emerged as a serious contender for Mr Felcht's status as the sector's merger messiah DSM last week agreed to sell its petrochemicals unit to Sabic for {XEU}2 25bn and has ambitious plans to double its speciality turnover by 2005 Indeed analysts would not be surprised by a marriage of the two companies With a market value of {XEU}7 4bn Degussa is unlikely to find itself an acquisition target although Eon could try to send it down the aisle in an arranged marriage Degussa's rivals are in little doubt about who is driving the restructuring but they are also impressed The mother company wants to get rid of it so the bride has to be good looking says one Degussa's track record with SKW and Laporte is good The question is no longer whether there will be mergers in speciality chemicals but whether Degussa can live up to its ambition of leading the consolidation Or whether its staff will be learning their way around someone else's headquarters ,1
2002-06-25, It is no surprise that Russia has run into trouble negotiating its entry into the World Trade Organisation Nor should last week's setback in accession talks be a matter of great regret A country as large and complex as Russia can join the WTO only on the right terms If it is not ready it must take time to prepare President Vladimir Putin's target of entry next year always looked ambitious Mr Putin's main motive is the political kudos to be gained from joining another important global club following this year's acceptance as a semi-detached Nato member But WTO accession is more than a symbol of international acceptance It is a process that requires a wide-ranging opening of the economy to global trade and investment Such an opening in terms of cutting import tariffs and other entry barriers must be accompanied by deep-rooted economic reform especially domestic liberalisation Russia is only at the beginning of the process It has liberalised enough in the past decade to win recognition this year from the European Union and the US as a market economy But there are serious doubts about Russia's willingness to open key sectors to foreign participation including financial services telecommunications agriculture and some parts of manufacturing notably furniture cars and aircraft It wants to develop strong domestic groups before allowing the full entry of foreign capital Not only is this incompatible with WTO accession it is an economic cul-de-sac The powerful business lobbies that have pushed the Kremlin to take such illiberal positions in Geneva must not win the day Russia's own history shows that closed economies and closed sectors are doomed The WTO does not demand free-market perfection restrictions are tolerated notably in agriculture But liberalisation must be at the core of Russia's accession strategy The country needs far more foreign trade and investment if the great mass of people are to share in the prosperity now enjoyed by the few The west should encourage Russia towards greater economic openness both for its own sake and for Russia's The world will be a richer and safer place once Russia is fully integrated into the global market economy The WTO can play its part by insisting that Russia joins only on the right conditions The first step is to abandon the 2003 target date as Mike Moore the WTO director-general did last week when he said Moscow might have to wait three years Russia needs time to devise sector-specific liberalisation plans compatible with WTO rules Without such policies there is little point in negotiating ,3
2002-06-10, Europe has been worried about its growing dependence on outside energy sources since well before the September 11 terrorist attacks made the world a more dangerous place The European Commission has been taking soundings about security of energy supply since November 2000 Now the radical conclusions it has reached are beginning to take shape The proposals the Comm-ission is gearing up to make range from greater EU control over oil and gas stocks to a closer relationship with Russia and even a concerted push for nuclear power They would also boost the Commission's own powers Oil stocks Most striking is the call by Loyola de Palacio energy commissioner for the EU to build up enough oil stocks to be able to intervene like a central bank to reduce price volatility in the oil market as well as to introduce a mechanism for sharing natural gas among member states She stresses that far from being a weapon against Opec any EU intervention on the oil market would be an instrument to avoid speculation and undertaken only in the context of a strengthened dialogue between oil consuming and producing countries She adds that for central banks it is the possibility of intervening as much as the act of doing so that often deters speculation Still smarting from the 1999-2000 tripling of oil prices Ms de Palacio's directorate also envisages setting up an observatory to distinguish underlying oil supply and demand trends from speculative movements although speculation has become integral to the oil market In today's market where the volume of paper oil traded on the London and New York futures markets is many times that of the physical oil consumed any EU intervention would probably have to be supported by other countries or organisations to be effective Ms de Palacio concedes the US is opposed to the idea When then President Bill Clinton helped steady the oil price in 2000 by selling oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve he was attacked by his Republican opponents for abusing the reserve for market manipulation rather than saving it for supply emergencies However Opec might welcome the de Palacio scheme if the EU acts to bolster low prices as well as restrain high prices The cartel's whole raison d'etre is market manipulation Gas stockpiling Mrs de Palacio's gas plans may be less controversial Access to gas stocks is already being debated in the context of the EU's drive to liberalise the gas market where incumbent companies are being pressed to share their storage with new entrants Initially EU states would just be asked to share available gas stocks if access to an emergency supply was needed a step made more logical by Europe's fast-growing gas dependence Sharing could also be more important for gas than oil because only some EU countries with underground caverns or old gasfields can easily store gas For the same reason setting the same minimum stock levels for all EU states would be harder for gas than for oil If the EU's relationship with Moscow became sufficiently close some Comm-ission officials even conceive of Russia providing explicit gas storage for the EU Certainly Russia will become ever more important as gas becomes a bigger part of Europe's energy mix Ms de Palacio recognises that growing energy dependence is unavoidable But she wants to minimise that as well as manage it better So she champions keeping the option of nuclear power alive unlike some Commission colleagues and several EU governments Nuclear power The last element of her programme is therefore a series of proposals to assuage public fears about nuclear power She believes the upgrading of reactor safety standards in would-be EU member countries in eastern Europe should be used to harmonise safety norms throughout the EU The EU should also set its member countries a timetable for dealing with nuclear waste the European public's biggest single nuclear worry according to opinion polls She adds that as nuclear plants give off no greenhouse gases If we want to stick to the Kyoto protocol on climate change we need nuclear Spanish pipeline IPO Page 20,3
2002-06-04, The low point of an economic downturn hardly seems the best time to negotiate the sale of a lossmaking asset in an unattractive sector But Thilo Sarrazin Berlin's finance senator is confident he can meet his timetable to dispose of Bankgesellschaft Berlin the troubled financial institution controlled by the city state by October That would mean he could receive an initial downpayment this year a small but symbolic contribution to reducing Berlin's debts of about {XEU}40bn $37 5bn with the balance coming in early 2003 In spite of the bank having just reported a {XEU}112m after-tax loss for last year and a {XEU}114m shortfall for the first three months of 2002 Mr Sarrazin believes Bank-gesellschaft is a much more attractive proposition today than it was last August when the city state was first approached about a possible disposal Since the initial contacts from Christopher Flowers the former Goldman Sachs investment banker who went on to buy Japan's former Long Term Credit Bank much has changed Mr Sarrazin argues From being threatened by bank regulators with closure Bankgesellschaft has been recapitalised More important the financial guarantees on controversial property activities have been transferred to Berlin itself relieving the bank of an almost incalculable future burden The group's discredited former management has been replaced And a new restructuring plan has been introduced with advice from Boston Consulting Group replacing former grandiose schemes with a much more modest plan for a regional bank concentrating on retail and mid-market commercial business All that makes the bank considerably more valuable than it was six to 12 months ago says Mr Sarrazin a former board member of the Deutsche Bahn rail group who took over Berlin's finance portfolio in January Retaining as many jobs as possible and a headquarters in Berlin remain crucial he stresses But the possibility that some Bankgesellschaft activities such as in capital markets could be transferred or terminated by a future owner is understood Even the concept that a private equity group might eventually sell on Bankgesellschaft's most attractive asset its retail banking franchise appears to be accepted albeit at the cost of considerable political pain Such realism marks a welcome development in Berlin where only months ago even the idea of a sale prompted entrenched resistance from politicians haunted by fears of losing face and patronage But the scale of the bank's {XEU}1 65bn loss in 2000 and the loss of about {XEU}2bn estimated for last year had it not been for the transfer of the real estate guarantees have led to a change of mood Politicians in Berlin see the issue of Bankgesellschaft as so encumbered that they in large majority are ready to make a clear break reckons Mr Sarrazin But whatever the more businesslike approach by the city state which owns 81 per cent of the bank's shares Bankgesellschaft is not out of the woods yet Low growth and severe economic problems in eastern Germany where Bankgesell-schaft's business is concentrated have constrained its commercial potential Moreover executives have become much more cautious about taking on new business limiting profit-making opportunities And while former top managers have been replaced many of the bank's middle- and lower-level employees remain shell-shocked by revelations of poor commercial judgment and political meddling in the past Mr Sarrazin suggests the best sign that the bank is on the path to recovery is that four bidders have come forward for the final round which started yesterday What they will be prepared to offer is another matter ,2
2002-06-15, OK so you've frightened me I want to save for my retirement What do I need to do The starting point is to decide how much you are likely to need to live on when you retire Traditionally the assumption has been two-thirds of final salary when you retire But some might be quite happy to live on less Half my current salary would suit me fine Come on tell me what next Patience! You need to work out exactly what your total assets are and what they are likely to be Include all your pension contributions and entitlements to date If you want to project how much your lump sum will be worth assume growth of about 4 per cent to 5 per cent a year between now and when you stop work Returns might well be higher but inflation will probably eat away a slice of that For years of service multiply the years by the salary you earned when you left that particular employment or are still earning Right done that What now Take your lump sum and calculate how much pension you might receive There is an online annuity calculator that will give you a rough idea of what you might receive at www ftyourmoney com Hargreaves Lansdown independent financial advisers can give an instant online quote Go to http// www hargreaveslansdown co uk Don't forget to add your state pension at 65 Blimey I'm earning £60000 a year and I'm on course for barely £15000 a year I need another £15000 How do I get there in the next 20 years Whoops For an inflation-proofed pension paying half an income to the surviving spouse and a 25 per cent lump sum a 60-year-old would need about £400000 more cash It would cost you about £1150 a month between now and when you stop work at 4 per cent annual growth But that's 25 per cent of my current take-home salary! I can't afford it! It's not all bad news As you are a higher rate taxpayer the Inland Revenue will contribute £460 That's still too much What other options do I have You could opt to take a smaller tax-free lump sum For example if you take just 10 per cent or £40000 your pension would jump to almost £17000 on the same terms as before Alternatively to get the £15000 you want the pension pot need only be £320000 That means contributions of about £875 a month or £525 net If you give up your tax-free lump sum entitlement completely you only need to raise £280000 That means contributions of £450 a month after tax relief for 20 years assuming growth of 4 per cent Well that's a bit more affordable What happens if I'm in work You can pay up to 15 per cent of your pre-tax income into a company pension scheme including additional voluntary contributions AVCs Or if your company offers stakeholder pensions your contributions will be age-related as with personal schemes This means you can place anything between 17 5 per cent and 40 per cent into a stakeholder depending on age Any other bright ideas The other alternative is to delay retirement slightly For example £200000 would buy a £10200 annual pension for a 60-year-old Delaying retirement by two years would increase that amount by £600 Or you could sell your home move somewhere cheaper and use the income to top up your pension Another question is it better for me to invest in an individual savings account Isas or a pension It depends Pensions receive up-front tax relief but you pay tax on the income you receive With Isas investments are made after tax but income is payable with no tax If you are a higher-rate taxpayer now and expect to be lower-rate after retirement a pension is more tax-efficient because you receive relief on your current earnings now This is enhanced by the fact that over-65s receive extra age-related allowances And don't forget the potential for a large tax-free lump sum But if you expect to be a higher-rate taxpayer after retirement don't forget to include your state pension the tax benefits are roughly equal Moreover an Isa gives you greater flexibility you don't need to buy an annuity before 75 and can pass the money on to your dependents Stock markets have been falling Should I not be thinking about buy-to-let property investments It depends Property is often seen as a good solid investment But historically property prices have not always been on an upward curve In the past 50 years you would have been better off investing in shares than property Nic Cicutti,3
2002-06-03, Toyota Motor Japan's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles is planning a sharp increase in component sourcing inside the eurozone as it seeks to reverse losses at its European operations Shuhei Toyoda president of Toyota Motor Europe said Toyota's purchasing spend in the region would increase from {XEU}1 5bn $1 4bn to {XEU}2bn this year of which almost 90 per cent would be invested with local suppliers The move forms part of Toyota's plan to achieve a break-even in Europe in 2003 with a longer-term target of a 5 per cent return on sales In the financial year ending March 31 the group lost Y12 4bn $99m on sales of Y547 4bn on its European operations compared with a Y23bn deficit in the previous year Mr Toyoda a member of the Toyota founding family said the purchasing initiative would also involve a shift for suppliers at its two UK plants The vehicle maker would increasingly invoice UK suppliers in euros he said He said that euro-sourcing for production at Toyota's Burnaston plant in the Midlands and at Deeside in Wales had increased last year from 40 per cent to 55 per cent of the total Toyota's growth ambitions in Europe are seen as a major threat to struggling vehicle makers such as Fiat Auto of Italy and Germany's Adam Opel which are both trying to contain losses and reduce surplus capacity Mr Toyoda said that strong demand for new models had enabled the company to revise upwards its volume targets for the region He reiterated that the group was seeking a 5 per cent share of the western European market within three years but added that it might seek an 8 per cent share beyond that But he insisted My main job is to improve the profitability of our European operations The main activity is of course cost reduction  That involves increasing capacity utilisation at plants around Europe He also raised the prospect of further technical alliances with other vehicle makers ,1
2002-04-27, Popularity can be a curse ARM Holdingsthe highly successful British semiconductor designer and Vodafone the mobile phone operator are certainly widely held stocks As one of the few remaining technology stocks in the FTSE 100 ARM acts as a lightning conductor for sector sentiment while Vodafone's position as one of the heavyweights in the index means it is too big to be ignored But their popularity has helped contribute to unrealistic expectations for share price performance Reality has crept in but two years after the technology bubble burst expectations may still be too high The accompanying chart shows that the UK market excluding technology media and telecoms shares has gained a little over 50 per cent since the start of 1997 while those sectors have made no ground at all Unfortunately many investors came to the technology boom in late 1999 and early 2000 when prices were already rising rapidly and have suffered losses over the past two years TMT stocks have fallen 75 per cent since their March 2000 peak while the rest of the market has increased by almost a quarter over the same period Even after the unwinding of the technology boom the survivors in the sector are not priced at attractive levels ARM trades on a prospective p/e ratio of 57 for 2002 and 43 for 2003 in spite of a 45 per cent drop in its share price from the year's highs in early January ARM has posted profits throughout the technology downturn and is a dominant player in some areas But it is not cheap Some analysts are concerned about ARM's ability to convert licence sales to royalty income The company also faces pricing pressures ARM shipped more units in the first quarter but royalties fell The current share price discounts phenomenal growth over the next 10 years and beyond says David Traherne at Williams de Broe stockbrokers which has a sell rating and a 100p target for the stock Williams de Broe also highlights the potential for new competing technologies to threaten ARM's market leadership in the wireless chip market Vodafone's valuation is also based on optimistic expectations for the future While I have covered the stock in recent columns it is difficult to ignore the latest developments Much awaited first-quarter key performance indicators KPIs were released on Thursday and showed falling subscriber growth but stable average revenue per user ARPU for its major European markets Vodafone itself has said its focus is now on ARPU rather than subscriber growth With the market maturing this sounds sensible but isn't the company trying to shift attention away from the decline in subscriber growth A net addition of 1 3m customers was at the bottom end of already reduced expectations and sharply down from fourth-quarter additions of 4 2m Vodafone's third change of the calculation basis for its KPIs does not reduce my cynicism The change this time involved recognising the full value of pre-paid phone cards sold through distributors in some of its markets The effect was to increase ARPU the number Vodafone wants us to focus on at the expense of margins At the very least the changes reduce the comparability of the latest figures with previous periods Revenue growth will be the key to both the prospects of ARM and Vodafone but there is a growing reluctance to invest on the basis of company assurances Proof is required and investors' caution is understandable Charles Dunstone chief executive of Carphone Warehouse said recently that its stores were selling about 35000 GPRS-enabled handsets a month but fewer than 200 consumers a month were signing up for the service GPRS is an interim technology that allows faster data downloads and is a precursor to third-generation 3G technology which will allow video downloads The whole mobile telecommunications industry has a lot riding on 3G and news this week of a further delay in the roll-out of the service at Vodafone's Japanese operations has not helped confidence ARM has broadened its market reach beyond the telecommunications market but its heavy involvement in wireless phone chips means it too has high hopes for 3G But will it be worth the wait The 3G licence auctions were like TV broadcasters bidding billions against each other for screening rights to a new sport whose rules have not been fixed where the stadiums are unfinished and where no one knows if it will be worth watching The fundamental outlook for Vodafone is cloudy at best and there is also little comfort for followers of technical analysis The accompanying 10-year chart for Vodafone shows the share price has broken down below its long-term trend line support The trend which started from the 1992 lows provided support in 1996 again in September 2001 and most recently in February this year The sharp share price drop in early April broke the long-term trend line before halting at the October 1998 lows at 110p After a brief respite this week's renewed price slide reached psychological support at 100p Markets often pause at round numbers and Vodafone has bounced off this support level But while prices remain below the rising long-term trend currently around 130p to 135p the outlook is not encouraging I believe ARM and Vodafone can be very successful but their popularity has done investors no favours ,2
2002-06-24, Mohamed Fayed has no intention of ever quitting Harrods his luxury Knightsbridge department store and one of the jewels of the Egyptian-born tycoon's business empire Not even in death I am going to make a mausoleum for myself upstairs on the roof In glass so people can come and visit me People need my soul he says It is a typically grandiloquent statement from Mr Fayed who after months of haggling has finally agreed to an interview with the Financial Times From the boardroom of the executive suite at Harrods he offers a tantalising glimpse of the state of his business empire which spans interests including the Ritz in Paris Fulham Football Club and Battersea Heliport and international oil mining and gold operations But he banishes his press advisers to another room leaving him free to attack the British establishment for yet another perceived injustice To his famously bitter attacks on the monarchy he is now adding the tax authorities And the plotting continues continuous plotting and the last one is the Inland Revenue I'm the only person from over 400 foreign investors I'm the only one they cancelled my agreement Mr Fayed says He is referring to last month's lost court battle to retain a special tax deal whereby he was allowed to pay a set annual sum of £240000 for five years He unwittingly jeopardised this when boasting about his access to large sums of cash during the Neil Hamilton libel trial In tearing up the 1997 deal Lord Gill said the arrangement effectively gave Mr Fayed carte blanche to bring as much money into the UK as he wanted The decision comes at an awkward time Mr Fayed has ploughed large sums of cash into developing the Ritz Fulham Football Club which earlier this year recorded one of the largest losses in British football club history is undergoing a costly capital investment programme to build a new stadium and now the performance of Harrods has weakened On the trading front the signals are mixed Harrods admits it experienced a significant downturn in visitor numbers during that month and a half after September 11 but the situation was not as dire as had been suggested  In the year ended January 2002 sales from Harrods Holdings chiefly made up of the store and Kurt Geiger shoes were about flat on the £608m the year before It was Fayed says a result which in October seemed unimaginable as the September 11 aftermath had left sales down nearly £20m Still without his minder Fayed wants to reassure his audience that the future is bright for Harrods He estimates the store will deliver flat profits of about £30m for 2001-02 but forecasts a substantial rebound this year In the new accounts to January 2003 we expect it to be £60m-£65m in operating profit he says It is perhaps another example of Mr Fayed's enthusiasm getting the better of him Later on the Harrods press office delivers a rather different line Not only was it likely that 2001-02 operating profits would be down but profits in the current year were more likely to be £30m The 2001-02 accounts to be filed with Companies House later this year are yet to be fully signed off But the real question is whether Harrods is generating enough cash to fund itself The answer is probably no After paying a £60m dividend in 2000-01 there was a net cash outflow from Harrods Holdings of £80m Debt stood at £333m Last year Harrods was remortgaged for £350m in order to repay debt and fund rebuilding refurbishment and other investment Most of that appears to have been used and Mr Fayed says there is still another £50m on projects still to go Where will this extra cash come from We'll take it from the profit and also from my private finances There is a dividend I take the dividend and it comes back again  On the size of the dividend he takes Mr Fayed says whatever is available If we have money we don't need they give it to me If they need money I give it back he says agreeing that at this point the dividend is flowing from him back to the company And as well as Harrods how is he funding the Ritz and Fulham FC I have other businesses international businesses and financial interests oil and mining businesses he says Mr Fayed says sometimes he will use money from these interests for other parts of his empire I have no problems with cash he says That does not mean Mr Fayed has no plans to raise cash on his assets But he says it is highly unlikely he would ever relinquish control of The Ritz or Harrods his two most prized assets Flotation however of Harrods and separately Fulham FC has been discussed on a number of occasions The FT in January reported that Mr Fayed was considering the flotation of a minority of Harrods Harrods then said at the end of March that it was about to reveal plans for a float which would include a first-come first-served share option offer It later admitted this had been an April Fool's joke although the story was carried by some leading news organisations Mr Fayed now says If the time comes then I think I will go public definitely But it will be on the American stock exchange  The American exchange is says Mr Fayed more practical and more international But the choice could be as much tactical as practical given that Mr Fayed might find it difficult to float successfully in London Many investors still remember the disappointing performance of House of Fraser after it was spun out of the Harrods empire in 1994 Mr Fayed and his brother Ali paid £578m in 1985 for House of Fraser which then included Harrods But 17 years later and at the age of 69 Mr Fayed sees himself as the lifeblood of Harrods He shows no sign of stepping back and he enjoys his role as hands-on chairman which involves spending several hours each day touring the business I will continue to work as long as I am able I could never retire he says In life you not only live for yourself but for the countless people you look after the people I have been devoting my life to for the last 30 years and more  And he continues You can't just let those people down it's not only for yourself If you are privileged and you've got finance then you don't put it in the bank You give people jobs  But although Mr Fayed stresses Harrods is a family business it is unlikely that any of his immediate family would be capable of taking it over if he had to hand over the reins Ali his brother and co-owner is also elderly His son Dodi died in a car accident in Paris along with Diana Princess of Wales nearly five years ago The eldest of his other four children is little more than 20 I have good management a great team of people he says Martha Wikstrom the former Nordstrum executive recently took over as managing director Jonathan Akeroyd merchandise director and Anil Tanna finance director Harrods has lost eight executives in little more than a year but Mr Fayed claims it is not especially unusual for there to be a turnover of people at all levels The casual observer may consider several senior departures in one year as a matter worthy of comment but there really is nothing untoward he says Some have left because they have failed to meet expectations As many people who work with me will tell you I do make great demands of my people ,2
2002-06-14, France Telecom's overstretched balance sheet could be saddled with another heavy burden next month after it emerged that it would have to pay about {XEU}457m $424m in cash to cover commitments made in a disposal two years ago Already battling to avoid a rights issue France Telecom has been hit with another little-noticed off-balance sheet liability this time linked to a slide in the shares of Crown Castle International a communications tower business it sold in June 2000 France Telecom sold 17 7m shares in Crown Castle at $28 50 to a financial institution in June 2000 pledging to make up the difference if the share price were lower in June 2002 Crown Castle shares closed at $4 14 in New York on Wednesday France Telecom yesterday rebutted the suggestion it had failed to highlight the liability clearly in recent disclosures of its off-balance sheet commitments The liability was too small to feature in the company's latest debt-reduction plan a spokesman said The group has negotiated a postponement of the payment initially due this month until July France Telecom said This will allow it to avoid recording it in its interim results for the six months to June 30 This is the latest example of how falling stock markets have exposed catches in the fine print of many of the deals agreed by France Telecom at the height of the bull market The largest risk relates to MobilCom the German mobile operator 28 5 per cent owned by France Telecom The French group is close to concluding a complex deal with 17 of MobilCom's lenders to swap the bulk of its German partner's debt for a security convertible into France Telecom stock at a 100 per cent premium With a real risk of a MobilCom bankruptcy the banks might now agree to a solution said analysts at HSBC A supervisory board member at MobilCom yesterday told the Financial Times the board was likely to dismiss Gerhard Schmid chief executive when it meets on June 21 Mr Schmid emerged unscathed from a previous vote last week after directors failed to muster a two-thirds majority against him This prompted France Telecom on Tuesday to cancel a two-year old commitment to bankroll the German operator causing MobilCom's shares to lose almost half their value Shares in MobilCom rose 30 per cent yesterday on hopes his imminent departure would ease an agreement between France Telecom and the banks on the restructuring of MobilCom's debt The German operator faces bankruptcy if it does not refinance {XEU}4 7bn of debt within the next six weeks ,2
2002-06-08, On National No Smoking Day in March 1m of the UK's 13 million smokers are estimated to have tried kicking the habit Judging by the stock market performance of the tobacco sector not many succeeded The FTSE tobacco index has been growing so strongly lately that by last week it was worth half as much again as it was a year earlier In other words £1000 invested in a mix of British American Tobacco Gallaher and Imperial Tobacco a year ago would be worth £1500 today not a bad return in a bear market The contrast with the fate of the market as a whole is stark The FTSE 100 this week broke out of the 5000 to 5400 range in which it has traded since last autumn to fall to 4920 at yesterday's close Barring the month-long market trough after September 11 this is the first time since October 1998 in the wake of Russia's debt default and the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund that the FTSE has fallen below the 5000 mark Bears believe it is a seminal event prefiguring the direction the market will take in the coming weeks after a sustained period of flat performance The FTSE 100 has been trading in an abnormally narrow 7 per cent range for eight months now says Tony Jackson UK equity strategist at ING Barings It had to break out one way or the other And I've been convinced for some time that it would break out at the bottom  He predicts a bottoming-out at 4600 the level of the last two troughs last autumn and in 1998 So what has gone wrong this time Belief that corporate valuations remain historically high and that interest rates will rise soon have played their part So too has the declining belief in the importance of equities Pension funds have been shifting ever more of their assets into bonds both to reflect the maturity of pension schemes and to avoid the reporting of volatile performance that new accounting rules would elicit Many private investors have also remained wary of shares since their fingers were burnt two years ago Out-of-favour technology media and telecoms stocks continue to drag down the average Without flops such as Vodafone now trading below 90p compared with a high of 399p two years ago the market would be more than 3 per cent ahead for the year The main trigger though has been Wall Street's bearishness There as here the main tussle over the recent months of sideways movement in the market has been between economic confidence and disappointing corporate profits Finally it appears earnings pessimism has won The tipping factor has been corporate scandal says Mr Jackson US capitalism is losing its moral standing  Investors have been hit hard by the proliferation of sleaze tax evasion at Tyco off-balance sheet debt at El Paso and Enron Bearishness whatever the cause turns investors towards defensive stocks And that says Richard Davidson European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley is the reason for tobacco's spectacular run Tobacco is the ultimate safe and visible sector  The past year's performance has not been a blip Tobacco has had a good run since October 1998 growing by 75 per cent Over that period only cyclical boom sectors forestry and paper mining and construction and building materials beat tobacco The cigarette companies outperformed all the other archetypal defensives such as banks beverages and health Some pundits are convinced tobacco's relative performance will weaken in coming months Media business services and telecoms are due for a comeback they say while utilities and tobacco have run their course But bears disagree A lot of the high-yield sectors will continue to do better says Mr Jackson at ING When the bounce comes the rubbish will come to the top again for a while But the long-term trend favours yield stocks  Tobacco boasts an actual yield of 3 4 far short of the 6 7 available on utilities the highest payers but a powerful cocktail when combined with the share price growth witnessed recently especially since the start of the year The companies have been booking attractive rates of profit growth and squeezing impressive cost savings out of a wave of merger activity The threat of costly legal settlements with cancer sufferers seems to be on the wane despite a A$700000 £276118 damages award against BAT in Australia the first outside the US With the FTSE having gone the wrong way out of its eight-month trading range tobacco and the other defensive sectors are set to outperform for a while yet Smoking might be bad for your health but tobacco it seems is good for your wealth  With England's World Cup hopes boosted by yesterday's victory over Argentina many fans' thoughts will turn to how they might turn a profit from their football fever A bet at the bookie's might seem attractive in today's mood of optimism But if Sven's men should falter what then Blind optimists might consider investing in football clubs again After dotcom-like popularity two years ago they have been out of favour for many months But if the frenzy of interest in the World Cup carries over into next season clubs could have earnings boosted by a rush on season tickets The top tip from analysts though is to start investing in sports agencies the companies that represent players in their negotiations with clubs and sponsors More public interest means more money and there should also be the usual annual boost provided by pre-season transfers and deal-making The listed agencies all quoted on Aim include Proactive Sports First Artist Sport Entertainment & Media and Premier Management Many operate internationally which should still make them a good bet even if heaven forbid England does not win the World Cup ,2
2002-06-14, The government will today propose new regulations designed to ensure that customers are not left without a telephone service if their telecoms supplier goes bust The move follows the bankruptcy last year of Atlantic Telecom the Scottish alternative telecoms operator which left some of its customers facing a loss of service The government is proposing four possible solutions to protect the interests of consumers These are that administrators are required to maintain a service for whatever period is necessary to allow alternative services to be put in place to amend the universal service obligation on BT Group which would require it to provide consumers with a basic connection to set up a statutory scheme to fund continued services when companies go bust or to spread the financial burden of operating the service of a bankrupt operator across the entire telecoms industry Robert Budden,3
2002-06-19, India's new markets watchdog has started to make his presence felt This week he banned Credit Suisse First Boston from trading equities for two years But Ghyanendra Nath Bajpai still has his work cut out to clean up a market recovering from a string of damaging financial scandals over the past year My aim is to restore investor confidence by promoting and protecting all stakeholders in capital markets says Mr Bajpai who was appointed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India in February Besides his ban on CSFB for its role in a price-fixing scandal last year Mr Bajpai is trying to limit the possible stock market impact of a Rs1bn $20 4m gilts scandal involving a flamboyant online trader and rural co-operative banks He must also conclude lengthy investigations into last year's equities meltdown which over-shadowed a widely praised budget infuriating the government which promised to act Previous Sebi chiefs have been notoriously weak during crises rarely prosecuting market offenders But Mr Bajpai says he will be firm The CSFB sanction is a useful sign of intent While Mr Bajpai's appointment surprised some market watchers he says he got the job because he was perceived as someone who has been successful at Life Insurance Corporation As chairman of the public-sector insurer he is credited with positioning LIC in the newly deregulated insurance market But his move from LIC to Sebi meant switching from investor to market watchdog a transition many regard as ill-advised given Sebi's poor standing among investors For example in recent months the Bajpai-led LIC was mopping up shares dumped by UTI India's largest mutual fund after a series of disastrous investments Indeed cleaning up the state-owned UTI which has some 20m investors will be among his more testing tasks UTI which enjoys special status exempting it from the normal regulations applicable to mutual funds is currently subject to government reforms As the regulator Mr Bajpai stands at the heart of this and not everyone is convinced he is up to the job An Indian public-sector financial institution with its questionable attitudes to non-performing companies and unsophisticated risk assessment is not ideal preparation for the job of regulating a modern capital market says a foreign investment manager who requested anonymity But Mihir Doshi managing director of JM Morgan Stanley in Bombay says Mr Bajpai has ably guided LIC at a time when insurance was liberalised He's positioned LIC so that it can compete with foreign insurers He has credibility which is what markets want  Mr Bajpai seems genuinely excited by the opportunity to rebuild the agency and outlines four pillars for the new Sebi First he promises timely adequate and appropriate disclosure norms that allow investors to make informed investments Second he wants tougher corporate governance to ensure companies brokers and funds take better care of the pool of wealth Third he wants Sebi to have the authority to ensure that managers of wealth act in the interest of stakeholders Finally investors must be educated because investor education is the best form of investor protection he says New laws will strengthen Sebi's powers to search and punish Mr Bajpai's choice of the word pillars seems appropriate given that the scandals of the past year have exposed the shallow foundations of Sebi's policing authority He also advocates a continuing strengthening of pillars because he says markets change due to domestic as well as foreign forces such as the demand for tough accounting standards following the collapse of Enron the US power company Mr Bajpai has spent his early months in the job energetically courting markets and their makers This week he meted down punishment to CSFB a process started by his predecessor Mr Bajpai seems to have started as he intends to continue ,2
2002-06-27, Their very presence is meant to underscore how Africa has risen to the top of the agenda for the world's leading industrial nations But as four African leaders address the G8 leaders in Kananaskis their proposals for political and economic reform across the continent face scepticism from world leaders and much of the development community At the heart of the G8 leaders' working session today is the New Partnership for Africa's Development Nepad represented by the presidents of South Africa Nigeria Algeria and Senegal The partnership holds out a vision of increased aid and trade between the world's richest and poorest countries in exchange for better government and less corruption in Africa However the US has serious doubts that African leaders can deliver on their promise to promote good governance through peer review by other African nations The African leaders are expected to outline their specific mechanisms for peer review today in the face of widespread dismay at their inability to condemn human rights abuses and the elections in Zimbabwe which were widely condemned as unfair The G8 is expected to issue its formal response to those proposals at the same time The sense of scepticism really comes from the crisis in Zimbabwe where they had already agreed on the principles of peer review but didn't honour it in terms of coming out and questioning the fraudulent elections said a senior US official Even once you have something institutional in place will they have the capability to hold their peers accountable For the Bush administration the African leaders' proposals mirror similar conditions for US aid from the newly-created Millennium Challenge account worth around $5bn a year on top of existing development aid However the US is developing its own mechanism for reviewing whether African countries are improving their standards of government and fighting corruption A senior official said the US was determined to direct the new funds to those African countries that are very serious about good governance and about open trade Let's be honest there's 54 countries in Africa said the senior official Is this peer review mechanism going to actually say that there are certain countries that are not living up to the standard That's a hard issue that they really need to face because I think the political tradition in Africa is one of inclusiveness and collectivity But with 54 countries if you're really going to have these standards everyone can't be in the standard  Some former US and international officials agree that the African partnership proposal is worthy but has proved impractical to date A panel drawn together by the Institute for International Economics including Henry Kissinger the former secretary of state and Sir Leon Brittan the former European Union commissioner concluded that it deserved applause but that The G8 leaders must ask the Africans some tough questions about their commitment to the Nepad process and decide whether it represents a solid foundation for proceeding together  Some analysts have also questioned the records of the very African nations pushing hardest for good governance Stephen Morrison Africa director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said Even the founders of this don't look like particularly stellar performers on human rights and respecting democracies if you look at Egypt or Algeria two of the founding five countries or Nigeria's utter ineffectiveness in stopping corruption But it is the only concerted game in town in trying to find some framework to reverse Africa's marginality and there is a certain amount of enduring empathy and concern which is why the G8 has leaned so far forward on this  For the non-governmental organisations NGOs campaigning intensively at the fringes of the G8 summit the initiative is a diversion from the more pressing challenges facing the continent particularly basic healthcare and education Amboka Wameyo African policy officer at Action Aid a London-based group operating in 16 African countries said the African leaders had succeeded in moving into the international spotlight But she accused them of simply pandering to business interests Nepad has been instrumental in mobilising discussion about Africa but beyond that we have serious concerns including the fact that Nepad has been developed in a closed way and doesn't reflect the priorities of the African continent she said ,3
2002-06-15, After two weeks of steady shelling equity markets have run for cover with UK and European investors leading the way into the foxholes Since the start of June the FTSE 100 has dropped by 8 9 per cent the Eurotop 300 by 9 5 per cent and the S&P 500 by a more muted 6 2 per cent Yesterday's movements swept across sectors with investors selling through index futures and over the counter options rather than through selective stock sales Simultaneously bond yields fell as investors switched out of equities The clear inference must be that in yesterday's market conditions fundamentals were of little importance Some mechanical factors are at play With stock market indices back to or below levels reached in the aftermath of the World Trade Center attack some insurance companies and pension funds have had to adjust their asset mix Last September the UK's Financial Services Authority temporarily relaxed the resilience tests it uses to measure insurers' ability to withstand sharp market movements It has not done so this time around The test scenario now envisages the FTSE 100 falling below 3500 There are indications that this has obliged some funds to shift more of their portfolios out of equities and into bonds and real estate Other European insurers face similar solvency constraints Investment banks that sold portfolio protection to insurers have also had to sell the underlying stocks to hedge their exposure The supply and demand equation for equities is not helping The pipeline of initial public offerings may not be full enough to keep investment bankers happy but it is full enough to allow investors to pick and choose In the UK Yell and William Hill are clamouring for attention Enagas in Spain and Pirelli Real Estate in Italy are also in the offing But primary offerings are being squeezed by secondary stock sales Fund managers have been bombarded with accelerated bookbuilding exercises the Finnish government selling down its holdings in Fortum and Stora Enso Stora Enso disposing of shares in Billerud the Greek government reducing its stake in OTE Corporate Europe still needs to rebuild its balance sheet so more equity sales are in the offing In this climate why not wait for the summer sales This does not mean that the fundamentals have turned for the equity market Earnings yield ratios are generally supportive For the European market the 12-month forward earnings yield of 4 98 per cent now matches the yield on the 10-year Bund For the US valuations are rapidly becoming more reasonable although doubts about the transparency of corporate earnings remain The more extravagant expectations for this year's economic recovery have been disappointed But monetary policy has so far averted stagnation and despite weakening consumer confidence most signs still point to a recovery of some sort The next few months however are unlikely to be cheerful for investors ,2
1998-04-02, Alfred McAlpine the construction company said yesterday it was prepared to sell its US civil engineering and construction operations Oliver Whitehead chief executive said There is no 'for sale' sign hanging up over the companies but it is no secret they are not part of the long-term plan  He said McAlpine had already been approached by potential buyers for the businesses which have net assets of £68m The news highlights the disillusionment of some UK building industry companies with the highly competitive US market Last week Caradon said it would sell its underperforming US doors and windows businesses A week earlier John Laing announced it would move its US housebuilding interests to a joint venture company as a prelude to flotation Operating profits from the two McAlpine subsidiaries Blythe Construction and Becker Minerals slid from £3 67m to £2 85m in 1997 on a £2 61m fall in turnover to £98 8m Their operating margin fell to 2 9 per cent The decline was the result of tougher competition in North Carolina Blythe's home territory Mr Whitehead said plans by the state to spend $1 7bn £1bn on infrastructure in 1998 attracted lots of out-of state contractors and prices fell 20 per cent The strength of UK housebuilding allowed McAlpine to shrug off poor US results and more than double overall pre-tax profits last year to £20 8m Operating profits from the homes division rose from £9 1m to £22m on turnover 54 per cent higher at £287 7m Raine the housebuilder bought last June for £42 6m contributed £6 5m in profits before exceptionals The operating margin grew from 8 7 to 10 per cent Unit sales rose 58 per cent to 2674 the year-end landbank held 8400 plots with planning consent equivalent to 2{1/2} years' supply Overall turnover grew 11 per cent to £658 7m A final dividend of 4 5p makes a total of 7 5p 7p payable from earnings per share 6 8p higher at 16 8p Comment  The buoyant housing market has helped McAlpine confound claims that it paid too much for Raine The company expects another strong performance from the homes division this year while undertaking more projects on a partnership basis should lift margins and spread risks in construction and civil engineering Following a 5p rise to 176p the shares are on a forward p/e of 8 5 based on a 1998 pre-tax profits forecast of £33m from Credit Lyonnais Laing This looks cheap against a sector average of 11 ,2
2002-04-09, Hungary's political parties were yesterday preparing for a closely-fought second round in the general election after Sunday's unexpected first-round defeat for Prime Minister Viktor Orban's centre-right government Analysts now predicta narrow parliamentary majority for the opposition ex-communist Socialist party although pre-election polls had suggested a win for Mr Orban's party Fidesz The second round on April 21 will be a run-off between the best-placed candidates in constituencies where none won an absolute first-round majority The Socialists and liberal Free Democrats coalition partners in the 1994-98 government are now likely to withdraw some second-round candidates where this will help each other's candidates win It's very very likely that we are going to have a Socialist-Liberal government in the next four years said Krisztian Szabados of Political Capital a policy research and consulting institute Fidesz leaders yesterday pointed out that in the 1998 elections the Socialist party also led in the first round and then lost in the second However in 1998 Fidesz had allies in smaller parties which then withdrew candidates handing Fidesz the victory These have since either been absorbed into Fidesz or in the case of the agrarian Smallholders' party collapsed The Smallholders' vote 14 per cent in 1998 was 0 8 per cent on Sunday There is only a very minor chance of Fidesz reversing these trends said Mr Szabados Fidesz has no reserves of possible second-round voters  The Socialists took 42 per cent of party list votes against 41 1 per cent for Fidesz's centre-right alliance list The Free Democrats took 5 6 per cent Median an opinion polling agency was predicting 198 seats for the Socialists an absolute majority of five It put Fidesz's eventual tally at 167 and the Free Democrats' at 21 Gabor Kuncze the Free Democrat leader said yesterday that his negotiations about withdrawals were aimed at securing Socialist support for the Free Democrat programme However he declined to say whether the Free Democrats would form a coalition with the Socialists The previous coalition heavily criticised within the party hurt the party's popularity badly Fidesz meanwhile appeared confused by its unexpected setback Zoltan Pokorni party president said that since Fidesz had won in 13 of Hungary's 20 provincial counties it had convinced more than half of the country Its defeat was down to a poor result in Budapest We advise our supporters in the provinces to take part in the second round Mr Pokorni said Their will should not be thwarted by Budapest  The surprise results were partly a result of a record turnout of 70 per cent after voter interest was spurred by Fidesz's divisive nationalistic campaign  Budapest equity investors appeared to welcome the first round defeat of Fidesz Cheered by the pro-market campaign promises of the Socialists investors also pointed to the unstoppable bull run under a Socialist- led coalition between 1994-98 For the latest news visit www ft com/europe See World Stock Markets,3

2002-06-04, The Canadian dollar fell sharply on world markets yesterday after the sudden removal of Paul Martin the long-serving finance minister before quickly rebounding It fell below 65 US cents in overnight Asian trading but recovered in North America to close at 65 47 cents up 0 02 cents from Friday's close The Toronto stock exchange was lower throughout yesterday's session with the S&P/TSX composite index ending down 56 59 points at 7599 54 Analysts said the markets were taking the government turmoil in their stride partly because of the sound economic policies that Mr Martin had put in place since becoming finance minister in 1993 The Canadian dollar was also benefiting from broader US dollar weakness The Bank of Canada is expected to stick with its strategy of incremental monetary tightening when it makes its regular monetary policy statement today and lift rates by a quarter point Ken Warn Toronto Chretien's crisis Page 18,2
2002-04-05, Singapore Telecommunica-tions yesterday sought to justify what investors saw as an expensive price for an increased stake in PT Telkomsel Indonesia's largest mobile operator as it confirmed reports of the $469m cash deal SingTel shares fell to a record low on Wednesday in response to reports that the state-owned operator had increased its stake in Telkomsel from 22 3 per cent to 35 per cent by paying a higher 25 per cent premium than the initial stake it acquired last year for $602m from Dutch operator KPN Telekom Lee Hsien Yang SingTel president said the deal would include taking a 35 per cent stake in TelkomMobile which would add more spectrum to its Indonesian operations The additional spectrum from TelkomMobile is a key part of the deal he said SingTel purchased the stakes from PT Telkom Indonesia's biggest phone operator which will still be the majority owner after both cellular units are merged Telkomsel Indonesia's largest mobile phone operator had about 3 3m subscribers as of December nearly half of the local mobile market which grew by about 60 per cent last year It's a very good move for Telkom said Laksono Widodo analyst with ING Barings securities in Jakarta The purchase will give SingTel access to the lucrative GSM1800 licences in a country with strong growth potential Indonesia's mobile phone penetration at 3 1 per cent of the market could rise to nearly 9 per cent by 2005 according to many analysts However minority shareholders of SingTel have complained that the return on investment from the operator's recent spree of acquisitions in south-east Asia have failed to match acquisition costs SingTel shares yesterday closed up 2 Singapore cents at S$1 58 The acquisition can be funded from our internal resources and it will not be a strain on our balance sheet said Mr Lee ,2
2002-06-04, Most US and European governments and opinion leaders seem remarkably complacent about the inevitability of the recoveries beginning to take hold in their economies Such unqualified optimism is unjustified and the greatest threat to recovery may well be geo-political Indeed it is not difficult to imagine a serious economic contraction initiated by the current perilous situation A classic cyclical rebound augmented by the US's impressive productivity increases remains feasible But even in the US many indicators cast doubt on the strength of the upturn high energy prices record trade deficits unforeseen and substantial federal budget deficits mortgage and other consumer debt at record highs continuing questions of exuberant valuations in the equity markets trade disputes with Europe and Japan inter alia  The stimulus of added liquidity from mortgage refinancing tax cuts and interest rate cuts is now a mostly spent force While inflation and interest rates are likely to remain low the strength of the dollar that has until now offset the risks of large US trade deficits and has propped up valuations in US markets is open to question Outside the US the situation is even more worrying Japan has been stagnant or in recession for 12 years now the Japanese government remains ineffectual and many of the country's financial institutions are flirting with insolvency In Latin America Argentina Venezuela and Colombia teeter on the edge of political and economic catastrophe and Brazil's economy is only marginally more stable In western Europe there is huge political uncertainty indicated by the strong showings of aggressive far-right parties combined with a poor economic climate Year-on-year growth in the eurozone in 2000-2001 was only 0 6 per cent Parts of Asia are encouraging in particular China South Korea Hong Kong and Taiwan however they are not without political risk As these economies are substantially driven by exports to the US and Europe they are also threatened by a return to recession In such circumstances investors and political leaders try to identify catalysts that could push these fragile economies into more serious contractions There are three obvious candidates One is a series of Enron-like scandals in the US markets impossible to predict but unlikely A second is a significant terrorist act that undermines the functioning of financial markets or substantial sectors of the economy The third which western nations may be able to influence is the continued violence in the Middle East If pro-western governments in Egypt Saudi Arabia Jordan and even Pakistan are threatened by angry popular reactions to Israeli military activity two outcomes are likely the collapse of one or more of these regimes to be replaced by tribal anarchy or fundamentalist Islam or a determination by the leaders of these governments that to survive they must oppose vigorously and perhaps even engage militarily with Israel The lack of a co-ordinated response from the US and Europe has contributed to the explosiveness of the situation The most radical elements in the Arab world and in Israel all believe by virtue of the sympathy and support they receive from abroad that they can succeed in their goals It is imperative that governments in Europe and the US recognise that their self-interest and prosperity and in Europe social and political stability are closely linked to a swift reduction of tensions in Israel Palestine and in the Arab world European governments seem to be motivated in part by a desire to exercise a foreign policy independent of the US and in part by the destabilising effect of their substantial unassimilated Muslim populations The Bush administration seems to be having difficulty recognising that the unilateralism of its first months in office is less effective than the coalition-building that tentatively began after September 11 As a result the broad strategic goals of the Bush administration in the Middle East in particular with respect to the threat posed by Iraq are in jeopardy Domestic political pressures on oil suppliers to the US and Europe may become so intense that the oil weapon will be the only policy outlet that appears available Perhaps the greatest risk of an inadequately co-ordinated policy is the conflation in the minds of the Muslim world of the vicious anti-west zealotry and apocalyptic binary view of the world that gave rise to the atrocities of September 11 with the legitimate demands of the Palestinians The US and Europe need to develop a more coherently aligned Middle East policy designed to prevent further polarisation between western and Arab opinion and to make clear to the most radical Arab and Israeli elements that there is no gain in playing one side of the Atlantic off against the other The fragility of the world's economies makes this particularly urgent The writer is chairman of Perseus Books Group and of Perseus LLC a merchant bank based in New York and Washington,3
2002-06-19, From Mr Douglas McBean Sir The aim of achieving excellent governance in the UK corporate sector is not advanced by daft posturing such as the advice from the National Association of Pension Funds to investors to abstain on the re-election of Tesco's chief executive report June 14 Tesco shareholders have seen the value of their company increase by 250 per cent on Sir Terry Leahy's watch a considerable feat Effective corporate governance though must be more than the much-maligned tick-box annual exercise in this case that is just what the NAPF was advocating Tesco should be acknowledged for ensuring that new directors are appointed following best practice ie one-year contracts not castigated for a hangover from former times What would have been the effect of let us imagine the NAPF's advice being followed and a few shareholders against his re-election leading to him leaving the company Would a new CEO with Sir Terry's knowledge experience and record be easy to find I suggest not I wonder too what message the small percentage of voters that followed NAPF has sent to Tesco Will the board now press for a renegotiated contract Should Sir Terry change to a one-year contract and take 12 months' emoluments in compensation thereof what fiscal benefit is that to shareholders Surely we need to be motivating our business leaders not handing them cash on a plate for window dressing Or does the NAPF believe our company executives are philanthropists and should just give up contractual rights agreed on both sides Effective corporate governance does need guidelines and a code of best practice but that is just what it should be not prescriptive not enshrined in legislation and most certainly acknowledging that one size does not fit all Douglas McBean Director Probitas Partners Edinburgh EH3 6HA,3
2002-06-18, Venture capitalists may do the deals that change the corporate landscape but they're also responsible for some of the dullest advertising around The back-slapping ads that let you know that Suit Tie & Cufflinks had a key role in the management buyout of Widget Screw and Nut are an industry tradition However there are signs that some firms are becoming more imaginative Last week Candover launched a L500000 campaign with spoof recruitment ads below a revamped website and a warts-and-all documentary starring four chief executives of MBO teams backed by the company Apax too has been advertising in the financial press and others are planning to do so in the autumn It's a far cry from the now and again of just a few years ago Candover marketing director Helen Walsh says that although the new campaign sits alongside a PR programme advertising can improve the firm's chances of reaching entrepreneurs at an early stage It doesn't generate deals or deal flow It generates awareness which in turn generates deal flow she says And that can only be good news after the recent slowdown in the management buyout market According to figures from the British Venture Capital Association the value of management buyout deals was down 24 per cent in 2001 at L2520m The decline has made the private equity market even more competitive Even today there are many fewer good big businesses with good management teams than there are firms with large sums of money looking to buy these businesses says Chris Ambler co-founder of Candover's agency WARL However market watchers are hoping for a raft of deals in the autumn and early next year as cash-strapped companies are forced to sell off non-core businesses Advertising now should get on the sellers' and potential MBO teams' radar at a key moment Some remain sceptical that advertising has value in the private equity market Business doesn't come to us through mass marketing it comes through relationships and networks says Jeremy Greenhalgh director of Charterhouse Development Capital Ian Armitage chief executive of Hg Capital argues that communication channels such as direct mail PR corporate hospitality and face-to-face meetings are more effective Advertising is the least cost-effective because it's scatter gun  However Theresa Wise media and entertainment partner at Accenture argues that advertising does provide other benefits You are creating something that a number one brand can do she says It's a very hard act to follow  alastair ray@btinternet com,1
2002-04-19, Tens of thousands of parents employing traditional nannies as childcarers have been dealt a triple whammy by Gordon Brown's tax rises Across middle England and the home counties professional couples yesterday began counting the cost of what is an expensive but popular form of childcare for busy high earners Tax experts warned that the cost of employing a nanny in London would rise by more than £500 a year or £10 a week after the chancellor raised National Insurance by a penny For anyone hiring a nanny this is a triple whammy said Peter Cullimore of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation Even though the chancellor said there would be special arrangements for people working irregular hours if they hire nannies they will have to pay more  Mr Brown's decision not to extend the childcare tax credit to cover nannies means parents will not only have to pay the extra one per cent employers' NI contribution but fund the nanny's contribution too The REC urged the chancellor to reconsider By tradition most of the 120000 nannies employed in Britain receive a net wage where taxes and social security contributions are paid by the employer The extra payments come on top of the parents' own NI rises The chancellor was careful to extend the childcare tax credit worth up to £200 a week to approved childcarers But under government guidelines nannies are not included The government wants to ensure it only funds safe good quality childcare said a Treasury official Eligibility for the childcare tax credit is therefore limited to approved childcare In England this is primarily childcare registered with Ofsted and regulated through national standards for day care and child-minding Nannies are not regulated by Ofsted and therefore do not conform to the national standards  Parents employing nannies were angry and dismayed The government has us over a barrel because we're in the higher earning bracket said Georgina Nayler who lives in west London But we're going to have to find the extra money for my partner and I to continue working and to keep the nanny we trust  Ms Nayler 43 is a director of a charity Together she and her partner earn more than the £58000 a year the chancellor set as the ceiling for qualifying for the tax credit They had been paying their nanny £260 a week to look after their two children full-time I don't resent the extra contributions going into the NHS as long as we can see it spent decently What I do resent is getting no tax breaks We're not rolling in money but we earn too much to benefit from any of the credits the chancellor has introduced We get taxed taxed and taxed again she added Stephen Vahrman of Brighton-based Nannytax the payroll service calculated that parents paying a nanny the average central London net salary of £344 a week would incur an extra £10 a week costs In the regions parents faced an additional £6 a week on an average £236 net wage It is estimated that parents living in the capital have to set aside some £35000 of gross income to pay for a professional nanny ,3
2002-06-28, The US is not the only place where previously fast-growing communications companies have been humbled this week Vivendi Universal and France Telecom two companies that used to embody France's global ambitions are facing crises of investor confidence The mess at France Telecom could even embroil President Jacques Chirac's newly elected government But unlike Bernie Ebbers at WorldCom both Michel Bon of France Telecom and Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi remain in place for now at least Mr Messier survived a tense board meeting this week while Mr Bon endured a downgrade of France Telecom's {XEU}63bn £40 5bn debt to close to junk status He seems to be losing a battle to stave off a huge rescue rights issue involving the government the majority shareholder In stock market terms both companies are shadows of their bull-market selves In March 2000 when the telecoms and media bubble peaked France Telecom was France's largest company Worth {XEU}208bn it was just over twice the size of its nearest rival TotalFinaElf Vivendi Universal was the third largest its shares valued at {XEU}83bn Today France Telecom's {XEU}11bn market value is a tenth of the oil group's The 95 per cent fall in its share price has left it in 25th position in the CAC-40 index of leading French shares Vivendi Universal shares have meanwhile fallen 74 per cent from their peak More than {XEU}250bn of paper wealth has evaporated from the two companies The companies have also underperformed their peers France Telecom's shares have fallen two-thirds since their October 1997 initial public offering underperforming Deutsche Telekom by 33 per cent British Telecom by 55 per cent and Telecom Italia by 74 per cent Since its merger with Seagram in June 2000 Vivendi shares have fallen about 75 per cent thus underperforming even the troubled AOL Time Warner by 21 per cent Some French bankers now compare the ill-fated international expansions of both companies to the 1980s experience of Credit Lyonnais under Jean-Yves Haberer which acquired the film studio Metro-Goldwyn Mayer just as Vivendi owns Universal Studios Like Mr Bon and Mr Messier Mr Haberer was an enarque agraduate of the elite E cole Nationale d'Administration In America the biggest financial disasters tend to be the result of individual greed leading to corruption but in France they come about when you give very clever and ambitious technocrats the means to implement a vision says one Paris banker It happened with Haberer at Credit Lyonnais and it looks as if it could happen with Messier and Bon Their eyes were too big for their stomachs  Whereas few blame Mr Bon for the bubble that inflated his shares Mr Messier wrote a book subtitled Why fear the New Economy But even by the standards of their industries both let shareholders down by taking on debt burdens and off-balance-sheet commitments that proved unsustainable Both companies chalked up mammoth losses last year with Vivendi's {XEU}13 6bn deficit the largest in French history Yet the two men have on their side both French politics and the traditional reluctance of French boards to force out chairmen France is slowly unravelling itself away from cross-shareholdings and board seats Although foreign shareholders make up 40-45 per cent of the French market they have not yet used their muscle to change things says Guy Barker of Georgeson Shareholder a UK corporate governance consultancy Mr Bon has indicated he would resign if a rights issue which most analysts regard as inevitable sooner or later took place at the current share price of about {XEU}10 However Francis Mer the French finance minister has every incentive to delay such an issue as long as possible The government owns 56 per cent of France Telecom and must by law hold a majority of the shares But subscribing to a rights issue could jeopardise the government's plans for tax cuts reverse the trend towards privatisation and perhaps draw criticism from the European Commission Despite this some analysts believe that a rights issue cannot be long delayed The company's gearing its ratio of debt to equity is now more than 300 per cent Furthermore falling values of France Telecom's disposable assets and weaker cash generation from its core fixed-line business have put in doubt its debt reduction plan JP Morgan estimates that France Telecom could end up {XEU}10bn-{XEU}15bn short of its planned figure Moody's the rating agency downgraded France Telecom debt on Monday and shareholders fear that most value is seeping away to bondholders France Telecom bonds now yield 10-11 per cent and the average cost of carrying its borrowings is becoming punishing It has to refinance {XEU}15bn of debt by the end of next year The route from here is a binary one either France Telecom pursues a path towards equity issuance of {XEU}10bn-{XEU}15bn which is becoming rapidly complicated by the falling share price or it maintains the status quo Neither is attractive to shareholders say JP Morgan analysts Mr Bon responds that it would be wrong simply to ape BT Group in seeking a rescue rights issue Sometimes I feel investors are saying 'Why don't these stupid French hurry up and just do what BT did' But that would be a mistake for us at this level There is more than the BT answer to the debt question  At Vivendi Universal Mr Messier is trying to restore his credibility following a series of strategic flip-flops Some investors fear that a liquidity crisis lurks beneath the media group's opaque accounting Its board members are becoming more cautious about the legal risks of approving transactions they do not understand On Tuesday Bernard Arnault of LVMH became the fifth director to resign this year That made Mr Messier more vulnerable to US board members including members of the Bronfman family from whom he bought Seagram the Canadian company that owned Universal For the moment Mr Messier appears to have persuaded the remaining French board members to back him These include chief executives with problems of their own such as Henri Lachmann of Schneider Electric and Serge Tchuruk of Alcatel Few expect this to work indefinitely Unless the French board members really believe that he can de-leverage the group rapidly get the share price back up near {XEU}40 and restore his own credibility they are probably trying to find a way to avoid losing too much face by arranging a way for him to go quietly says one analyst Mr Messier has also exploited France's fear of globalisation His deliberate attack on the French cultural exception the system of subsidies for French film whipped up hostility to the Americanisation of Vivendi Universal and its Canal Plus pay- television unit which finances seven in 10 French movies This has made him unpopular but it has also reminded the French cultural establishment that however much it may dislike Mr Messier it would find Barry Diller who runs the US film and television operations even harder to swallow Sometimes it helps to be provocative says Mr Messier There is no way the French will allow an American to run Cegetel Vivendi's 44 per cent owned telecoms unit Canal Plus or Vivendi Environnement says a French media analyst at a US investment bank in London Politically the French board members would find it easier to spin off the group's US entertainment assets to the Americans and then find appropriate ways to negotiate an exit from the sensitive domestic assets  For the moment Mr Bon and Mr Messier are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the equity markets One analyst says To survive they need a real rebound in sector valuations a couple of quarters of good operating results and one or two big asset disposals Two out of three will not be enough ,2
2002-06-06, The oil majors represented more than a third of the market's losses yesterday after their share prices reacted to a build-up of US oil supplies The overnight data from the American Petroleum Institute showed an unexpectedly large rise in stocks of crude oil Tuesday's API figures showed an increase in crude oil of 6 3m barrels to 324 2m in the week to May 31 BP shrugged off encouragement from a Deutsche Bank buy note to fall 20 to 565p while Shell Transport fell 15 to 515p Between them the stocks were responsible for about 35 points off the FTSE 100 index Credit Agricole Indosuez Cheuvreux said the API figure represented a return to last year's level and European oil stocks valuations were not yet attractive enough to justify buying oils aggressively Its preferred players were BG ENI TotalFinaElf and BP The broker said the weak performance of the European majors since the start of the second quarter was due not only to oil price weakness but also to pressure on refining margins and a fall in the US dollar However analysts highlighted recent remarks from Saudi's oil minister that Opec oil output quotas would not be increased at this month's meeting AstraZeneca lost earlier gains in spite of news that Crestor its cholesterol treatment had received a conditional letter of approval from the US Food and Drug Administration Analysts said the letter should mean that the US agency will approve the drug soon but clarification regarding the drug's dosage could still prove to be a stumbling block There was also some concern that AstraZeneca refused to make any comment about the details in the letter AstraZeneca was asked to furnish the FDA with additional data on the drug's safety at higher doses in April Crestor is considered to be AstraZeneca's biggest new drug hope but some analysts have said it could fall well short of expected sales estimated at up to $5 6bn a year by 2008 if a higher dosage is not approved The shares ended the session down a net 56 at £29 50 Insurers weaker Insurers were weak as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter adopted a more cautious tack as part of a wider rethink of its valuations for the European insurance sector The broker maintained its in-line weighting on the European insurance industry in spite of its recent shares price outperformance but continued to have longer-term concerns regarding life insurance liabilities Morgan Stanley cut its recommendations for Prudential and Legal & General to underweight from the equal weight with price targets of 634p and 133p It warned that the likely need to give policyholders better terms from with-profit contracts incurred a cost and it seemed unlikely that independent financial advisers would be willing to give up their share of the pie Morgan Stanley also revisited its price targets for CGNU and Friends Provident with the targets cut to 567p and to 221p It said Prudential Legal & General and CGNU would survive and prosper but their stock prices did not reflect the economic reality of the harsher regulatory and investment environment Morgan Stanley also made adjustments to several price targets of European industry players Legal & General fell 4 to 147{1/4}p Prudential 15 to 651{1/2}p CGNU 18 to 621p and Friends Provident 8 to 167p South African Breweries was the best performer in the 100 index with a rise of 12 to 587{1/2}p in response to its $5bn purchase of Miller Brewing Goldman raised its 2003 earnings per share forecast by 8 per cent to 51 cents and its 2004 estimate by 21 per cent to 62 cents to reflect better-than-expected trading in South Africa and Europe a new rand/dollar assumption and expectations of the Miller deal completion It lifted its target price on the stock to 575p but reiterated its market performer rating The broker said the combination of SAB and Miller would reduce rand dependence to 24 per cent of combined 2004 earnings according to its forecasts It said the lower risk premium attached to Miller should mean a lower combined cost of capital for the newly enlarged group But it believed the key risk for SAB is of negative surprise to the Miller cash flow growth Cordiant Communications fell sharply after the advertising group denied it was in merger talks The stock dropped 6 to 93{1/2}p It has lost more than three-quarters of its market value since its peak of more than 400p in March 2000 One Sunday newspaper said Havas of France was about to launch a £700m bid for Cordiant but on Monday Havas said it was not in talks Cordiant shares have suffered from the industry-wide downturn in advertising after the US economy began to slow two years ago Reuters fell further below its historic 500p support level after a profits warning from Tibco Software its 51 4 per cent owned subsidiary Tibco said it expected to report a loss per share of 18 to 23 cents for the second quarter to May Preliminary results indicate revenue in a range of $63m to $65m The share price closed 18 off at 448{1/2}p Invensys rating cut Invensys dipped 4 to 102p after Teather & Greenwood cut its rating for the control systems and energy management group to sell from hold after recent full-year results The broker said the combination of a high valuation at nearly 12 times 2004 earnings and a weak economic picture present a poor risk/ reward ratio for the stock It added that Invensys' full-year figures released last week contained no surprises and although the company's restructuring and new strategy remained on track it saw little upside in the share price Xansa the business consultancy group was stronger in initial trading after completing negotiations to take over the running of BT's accounting division Old Mutual Securities moved its stance on Xansa to add from hold on a price target of 180p Xansa said its contract with BT would be worth £250m over seven years The deal first announced in October last year involves the transfer of about 570 employees from BT's Accounting and Financial Services unit The shares were 7{1/2} better at one stage but fell with the market to close 5 lower at 137{1/2}p MyTravel which was knocked heavily after a warning about future performance and a sharp fall in profits a couple of weeks ago recovered somewhat yesterday The shares which had been down more than 30 per cent since the May 21 figures rallied 9{1/2} to 161{1/2}p the best performance among the midcap stocks Regular equities updates at www ft com/equities,2
2002-06-21, Machines that dispense ice-cold fizzy drinks in all the colours of the rainbow have helped IMI the engineering group lift sales and reassure investors that the business is recovering from the worst effects of September 11 The machines appealing to consumers' taste for theatre exemplify the enthusiasm for new products of Martin Lamb the chief executive appointed last January to revive IMI's flagging fortunes IMI said volumes in its beverage dispense division had been buoyed by a £25m order for the equipment received late last year from a US customer The drinks unit had been badly hit by a slowdown in the US restaurant trade last year Trading was still depressed in three other divisions But a unit specialising in tough industrial valves was performing well and IMI said overall the group should make progress in the current year David Larkam of Old Mutual Securities said The update shows everything is on track at IMI at a time when people are concerned about deteriorating corporate earnings  Mr Lamb said he was pleased the shares up 2{1/2}p at 314{1/2}p yesterday had closed a ratings gap with other engineers But we need to show IMI is a growth story to command a premium  Comment  Some analysts appeared spooked by the technicolour iced drinks handed round by Mr Lamb at IMI's last results meeting Mr Lamb's salesmanship has proved more effective in presenting a positive and coherent view of a once out-of-favour business At the same time he is delivering on sensible promises such as moving swathes of manufacturing to low-cost economies The engineering sector has rallied strongly thanks to its cash-generative qualities But IMI up some 60 per cent since October has outperformed the sector average by more than 30 per cent Its prospective earnings multiple of 13 now mirrors the sector average If Mr Lamb worked in one of the fast-food restaurants which use his drinks dispensers his name badge would boast four stars Selling the pipes division for a good price would earn him a fifth ,2
1998-04-02, Was there a leftwing plot to overthrow the South African government Or was there a plot by rightwing whites to destabilise the government by concocting an intelligence report suggesting an imminent leftwing coup Having dismissed the first suggestion as fanciful President Nelson Mandela and his four-year-old government are now taking the second possibility a rightwing conspiracy much more seriously Yesterday Mr Mandela was presented with the findings of a hastily convened inquiry into the intelligence report which alleged a coup plot He is expected to disclose the inquiry's recommendations and take action on them in coming days If heads are to roll the most likely target is Georg Meiring head of the South African National Defence Force who passed on the allegations of a leftwing plot to Mr Mandela in February Pakamile Mankahlana Mr Mandela's spokesman yesterday described as totally flawed the way the report had been compiled It is impossible to take the so-called Meiring report seriously he said Government officials say it was obvious from an early stage that the leftwing plot theory was implausible and they attribute the allegations to disaffected whites who regret the end of white minority rule Among those said to be implicated in the report on a supposed left-wing plot are former ANC guerrillas including Siphiwe Nyanda the SANDF chief of staff who is likely to succeed Gen Meiring and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela the ex-wife of the president Mr Mandela insisted that the inquiry should investigate not the dubious contents of the report but how and why it was compiled But several questions remain unanswered Why did Mr Mandela sit on the report between February 5 and March 28 and then suddenly call for an inquiry of three senior judges to report on the matter in three days The government's explanation for this is that Mr Mandela had to act because the contents of the intelligence report were leaked to the press And what was the role of Robert McBride an ANC member who was convicted under the previous regime for a bomb attack in Durban but later reprieved and became head of the foreign ministry's Asia desk Mr McBride was one of those named in the intelligence report handed to Mandela The foreign ministry says he was not on government business when he was arrested in Mozambique allegedly for gun-running Only the South African and Mozambican authorities are likely to be able to cast light on the mysteries of Mr McBride and the alleged leftwing plot ,3
2002-06-29, Xerox's shares were hard-hit by the announcement of a larger-than-expected $6 4bn reversal of revenues from copier equipment sales over the past five years The copier group had to reduce its revenue by $1 9bn and its pre-tax income by $1 4bn for the 1997-2001 period as part of its April settlement of charges of improper accounting brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission Although the restatement was expected Xerox had a deadline of Monday to file the changed accounts with the SEC reports of the restatement added to concerns about US corporate malfeasance stoked by WorldCom's announcement on Tuesday of an apparent $3 8bn fraud in its accounts By midday in New York Xerox stock was down 15 per cent The group's bonds were also hit The magnitude of the misstatement is quite a bit bigger than we were expecting said Daniel Kunstler analyst with JP Morgan Chase However he added that the latest statement marked an end of the copier company's troubled saga rather than a new WorldCom-style scandal We are fairly done now with the Xerox melodrama he said Xerox underlined that the restatement covered revenues that would eventually all feed through to the company's accounts The SEC charge was that Xerox had brought forward revenues in order to improve its reported performance as its core operations declined in the late 1990s Xerox paid a fine of $10m in April but never admitted or denied any wrongdoing The SEC had estimated that Xerox would have to reverse more than $3bn of equipment sales revenue But Xerox now under different management and with a new chief financial officer Lawrence Zimmerman decided that it would take a more sweeping view because of the nature of its Latin American business which was at the epicentre of the accounting scandal Specifically the group decided to classify its Latin American leases as rental leases revenue from which is recognised over the period of the lease instead of sales leases for which part of the revenue can be recognised at the outset of the contract The $6 4bn reversal of revenue was offset by $5 1bn of revenue that has since been recognised and reported by the group The effect of the restatement on 2001 figures was to increase revenues to $17bn compared with $16 5bn reported and to decrease the loss per share from 43 to 12 cents Based on earlier reports of Xerox's position KPMG which audited the accounts for the period said that it stood by its work and the Xerox restatement defied economic reality With the accounting scandal behind it Xerox's overall financial position appears more secure Last week Xerox renegotiated its $7bn credit facility repaying $2 8bn of the revolving facility and pushing back the maturity date for most of the rest of the outstanding loans until April 30 2005 Xerox said it had already agreed with lenders that the loan covenants would adjust to take account of any restatement The filing of audited statements for 2001 and on Monday for the first quarter of 2002 means Xerox could tap the capital markets for the first time in 18 months ,2

2002-06-10, The Spanish stock market regulator is expected to approve the prospectus today for the sale of Enagas Gas Natural's pipeline network giving the go-ahead for Madrid's first initial public offering in more than a year The government which ordered Gas Natural to sell 65 per cent of the operator sees the divestment as a crucial step in liberalising the gas market and enticing more participation in the fastest-growing energy market in Europe Recent legislation has unbundled the gas tariffs establishing separate tolls for the transport and storage of gas across Enagas' network and distribution to final consumers by Gas Natural The regulatory changes which came a year behind schedule allow Gas Natural to meet the government's decree to sell the Enagas stake ahead of full liberalisation of the sector next year Analysts estimate the fair value of Enagas to be about {XEU}2bn $1 88bn excluding more than {XEU}1bn in debt However the banks preparing the sale have been reluctant to pin down a valuation outside of a wide range of between {XEU}1 6bn and {XEU}2 4bn Goldman Sachs is handling the international tranche of the offering while BBVA Santander Central Hispano and La Caixa have been assigned the Spanish placement Schroder Salomon Smith Barney is advising Gas Natural Between 35 and 40 per cent of the shares will be offered to retail investors with the remainder split between financial institutions and companies operating in the sector The handful of independent gas distributors and the big electricity companies especially are keen to gain some control over Enagas to ensure that their gas demand is met More than 30 proposals for gas-powered combined cycle electricity plants have been announced in Spain since the energy sector liberalisation began in 1997 The plants are more efficient and ecologically friendly than traditional energy sources However their reliance on gas is leading the electricity companies to take steps to protect supply The combined-cycle plants and increasing retail use only 35 per cent of the population currently has access to natural gas compared to about 65 per cent in Europe will drive demand ,2
2002-06-10, Vladimir Spidla leader of the Czech Social Democrats is often likened to Lionel Jospin the former French premier but he is said to relish the comparison He can probably afford to do so Unlike his role model Spidla looks likely to win next weekend's general election Opinion polls show that the social affairs minister has overtaken former premier Vaclav Klaus his rightwing opponent and centrist parties are queuing up to form a coalition with him An unashamedly old-fashioned socialist he is respected more for his diligence and honesty than for his charisma And while he lacks Klaus's presence or ease of manner on the campaign trail many Czechs seem to prefer his low-key style In their last TV debate yesterday Spidla quietly and clinically made his points ignoring Klaus's smirking condescension and came out on top But perhaps the real key to his success is that Spidla has made clear he will do everything to try to form a government without Klaus a stance that seems to have boosted his support among all those longing to see the former premier out of politics for good ,3
1998-04-04, Cunard one of the most famous names in the cruise shipping industry and owner of the luxury liner QE2 is to come into American ownership in a $500m £299m deal agreed last night Carnival Corporation a Miami-based cruise line and a group of Norwegian investors are to buy Cunard and the five ships in its fleet from Kvaerner the Norwegian shipbuilding and construction group Kvaerner said it expected to make an accounting gain of $35m on the sale which it expects to complete within six weeks Kvaerner acquired Cunard in 1996 as part of its £904m takeover of Trafalgar House the UK construction and shipping group and had been looking for a buyer or joint venture partner since then The $600m Kvaerner was seeking deterred many bidders cruise industry managers said The Cunard acquisition comes at a boom time for the cruise industry Many operators have placed orders for ever larger and more luxurious vessels About 5m Americans take a cruise each year compared with 500000 in 1970 while the UK cruise market has grown at between 12 and 15 per cent a year Carnival plans to merge Cunard with Seabourn Cruise Line in which it is equal partner with a Norwegian entrepreneur Atle Brynestad in a move that Carnival said would create the largest cruise company in the luxury segment of the market It would be two-thirds partner in the merged group This is part of Carnival's strategy to strengthen its position at the luxury end of the cruise business said Micky Arison Carnival chairman and chief executive The QE2 is the best known cruise ship in the world and commands a vast customer following from around the world  Carnival said it did not expect the purchase would dilute its earnings per share As part of the deal Carnival will build two cruise ships for the Cunard fleet at Kvaerner's Masa Yards in Finland Despite the QE2's reputation it is 30 years old and gained negative publicity for Cunard in 1994 when it sailed from a German yard after a refit with workmen still on board and many of its services not working Cunard suffered a £16 4m loss in 1995-96 the last year for which figures are available but Kvaerner said it had worked hard to improve its performance The Royal Viking Sun is the only modern vessel in the Cunard fleet with the Vistafjord Sea Goddess I and Sea Goddess II also relatively old vessels Carnival's cruise operations comprise Carnival Cruise Lines Holland America Line and Windstar Cruises while it also has stakes in Costa Cruises Seabourn and Airtours the UK company credited with opening up the cruise market to budget-conscious holidaymakers They sail a total of 37 ships in the Caribbean off Alaska and in European waters ,1

2002-06-20, General Motors the world's largest carmaker has played down the prospects of merging its European operations with Fiat Auto the loss-making arm of Italy's largest industrial group Rick Wagoner GM chief executive said the two companies were pushing ahead with their two-year-old alliance but had not discussed the possibility that Fiat could exercise a put option to sell 80 per cent of its car division to the US carmaker after 2004 Fiat is under pressure to reduce its net debt of {XEU}6bn $5 7bn through a combination of disposals and restructuring prompting claims by some analysts that it might have to withdraw from carmaking Fiat has so far denied it has any plans to sell out to GM which paid $2 4bn for 20 per cent of Fiat Auto two years ago Mr Wagoner said GM had not raised the issue with Fiat pointing out that it was mid-way through restructuring its own loss-making European operations mainly at its Adam Opel subsidiary in Germany involving a 25 per cent reduction in capacity The put is their call and even assuming that is out of the way could you get to the desired state when restructuring is needed in both companies or do you first get restructuring going in each Mr Wagoner asked Executing the plan we've got will help a lot he said Mr Wagoner confirmed that GMAC the consumer credit and financing arm of GM was considering a tie-up and possible equity stake in Fidis the financial services arm of Fiat The Italian group is considering selling 51 per cent of Fidis as part of its latest refinancing Three Italian banks participating in the refinancing Banca di Roma Intesa BCI and SanPaolo IMI have offered to acquire control of Fidis but GM has first call on that business under its Fiat alliance Mr Wagoner said GMAC is going to be looking at it We haven't come to a conclusion  We have really just begun to look at the data and it's going to take a while Other matters of funding costs need to be analysed to see if it's the best for both of us Mr Wagoner added He pointed out that the main challenge for GM itself was to rebuild its balance sheet strength and generate enough cash from its core auto business to offset mounting pension and healthcare liabilities  Fitch the ratings agency yesterday affirmed Fiat's senior unsecured debt at BBB and upgraded its outlook to stable from negative Fiat and its bankers are still awaiting an evaluation from Moody's which has threatened to downgrade some {XEU}10bn in long-term debt www ft com/autos,1

2002-06-17, EasyGroup the diverse holding company founded by Stelios Haji-Ioannou is restructuring its car rental operations ahead of a flotation expected to value the business at up to £250m Mr Haji-Ioannou who founded EasyCar two years ago said he was planning to adopt low-cost business practices modelled on the EasyJet airline to reduce overheads and improve margins at the car hire unit EasyCar is expected increasingly to move away from higher cost Mercedes cars the mainstay of its existing fleet to cheaper models from manufacturers such as Vauxhall and Renault The company is also abandoning standard industry practices on refuelling and cleaning cars offering cheaper rental rates to customers taking on that role Mr Haji-Ioannou said the new business model which has already been piloted at one of its central London outlets would be rolled out across its European network He added I have given the management about nine months to push through and in this time I want to expand the business from 19 sites to 40 locations  The strategy is intended to pave the way for a stock market flotation in November 2004 By that time the group hopes to be generating annual sales of £100m from a fleet of 20000 vehicles That target implies an aggressive expansion over the next 18 months given that current sales are running at about £25m on an annualised basis from a vehicle fleet of 6000 cars It is understood that the listing will be closely modelled on the flotation of EasyJet with only 25 per cent of the company initially offered to investors Mr Haji-Ioannou founder and chairman of EasyJet initially floated 27 87 per cent of the airline His stake in the carrier has since declined and is likely to fall from 26 7 per cent to 22 8 per cent following the completion of its takeover of Go EasyJet's low-cost rival EasyCar's expansion could prove a serious competitive threat to established car rental companies such as Avis and Hertz These groups have already been hit by intense price competition and a reduction in international customers which followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US As a result of EasyCar's new business strategy Mr Haji-Ioannou said the group would move to break-even more quickly reversing estimated losses of £7 5m in the financial year to September 30 2001 He said the group would move into profit during the year while targeting operating margins of about 10 per cent by the time of its flotation in late 2004 He predicted that the group by then could be valued on a price earnings multiple of between 20-25 times ,2

2002-04-12, The one black mark against Alan Giles the 47-year old HMV chief executive is that he is the man most closely associated with Waterstone's the book retailer whose trading deteriorated so badly in 1999 and 2000 that HMV's banking covenants were in danger of being breached writes Peter Smith Mr Giles who was passed over for the role of chief executive at WH Smith in 1997 landed the role of chief executive at HMV Media a business created six months later following the merger of EMI' music retailing and Dillons bookstores business with WH Smith's Waterstone's chain Under the HMV umbrella it has been a game of two halves for Waterstone's Its profits reached nearly £50m in 1998-99 only to fall to £36m the following year It was a nasty drop in a highly-leveraged structure that did not leave a lot of room for manoeuvre he said yesterday The problems stemmed from lost market share following the arrival of internet rivals such as Amazon It hit Waterstone's hard because it is a high-end range bookseller selling to a predominantly male upscale well-educated audience who of course are also early adopters of technology Mr Giles said Waterstone's problems were compounded because it was intergrating Dillons and expanding retail space in a low-growth more competitive market Mr Giles soon after appointed Brian McLaughlin as chief operating officer with overall responsibility for Waterstone's as well as HMV Mr McLaughlin 52 has spent most of his working life at HMV and was appointed managing director of HMV Europe the group's profits powerhouse in 1997 Waterstone's has since adopted a more centralised approach to the management of the 200 Waterstone's stores It has also mimicked marketing concepts employed by HMV His brief was to improve operations across the group with Waterstone's the initial priority Mr Giles said The trading recovery is in evidence at Waterstone's Profits over the important Christmas period rose to £22m £20m on sales of £141m £137m Like-for-like sales rose 5 2 per cent the sixth quarterly increase Together with Neil Bright finance director Brian McLaughlin and Alan Giles account for about 5 2 per cent of the 13 per cent stake held by HMV's senior management The value of that stake is unclear with one adviser saying the management stake was worth between £10m and £40m while another said it was £5m to £15m The highly-leveraged nature of the £803m original buy-out meant the ordinary equity of the business was only £10m of which management held a 13 per cent share After new money is raised and preference shares redeemed management's stake will drop to between 1 and 4 per cent or £10m-£40m according to one analyst who estimates the business will be worth £1bn ,2

2002-06-26, Gordon Brown the chancellor has promised to back the Bank of England in raising interest rates and has made it clear he would not be bounced into joining the euro by the recent fall in the pound In an interview with the Financial Times on the eve of his annual Mansion House address to the City tonight Mr Brown gave a strong signal that he expected the Bank would soon raise interest rates to prevent rising house prices and strong consumer demand from re-igniting inflation We will back the Bank of England in the coming months in the decisions that it makes he said He added that his public spending review next month would aim to stimulate productivity But he gave an assurance that defence and law and order which have faced the fiercest behind-the-scenes spending battles will not be ignored He also indicated that he did not think the pound's fall to a 32-month low against the euro had fundamentally changed the debate over euro entry Mr Brown set out to calm nerves in the financial markets saying he was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for growth in the UK and in the world economy this year and next But he showed concern about the strength of consumer demand including soaring house prices at a time when the world economy was reviving With this strengthening global recovery and domestic consumer demand already strong against a background of historically low interest rates the Bank of England will have tough choices to make in the coming months to ensure sustainable growth and the maintenance of stability he said The Treasury stressed that Mr Brown was not calling for interest rates to rise or trying to put pressure on the Bank Its monetary policy committee has full independence to set interest rates But the chancellor's words could intensify pressure on the committee for an early rate rise The weakness in stock markets has led analysts to think it may hold back from a move at next month's meeting Mr Brown refused to accept that the pound's recent decline from less than £0 61 to the euro in April to about £0 648 yesterday would make a difference to the Treasury's assessment of the five economic tests due by next June The important thing that I think the British people do understand is that these decisions have got to be made with a view to the long-term future of the economy he said Mr Brown said the spending review due next month would focus on steps to boost education training and scientific research But he suggested defence asylum and crime would not suffer by comparison It is bound to be the case in the global economy that foreign affairs defence and international development have a new role to play and therefore have an importance in the spending review  Keeping his balance Page 19 Editorial Comment Page 18 FT com subscribers can read the transcript at www ft com/brown,2
2002-06-28, HMV the music and book retailer which yesterday reported profits in line with its prospectus forecast paid out £31m in fees as part of its ill-fated flotation in May The shares which were priced near the bottom of the range at 192p at flotation subsequently fell a quarter to a low of 143{1/4}p Yesterday they rose 7p to 153p valuing the group at £618m The float was led by UBS Warburg and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney but HMV said the £31m also included fees for accountants lawyers and public relations HMV reported a 37 per cent rise in annual operating profits before exceptionals of £105 6m £77 1m on sales 7 per cent ahead at £1 65bn £1 54bn Alan Giles chief executive said HMV Europe which trades from 147 outlets had driven growth while there had been a recovery at Waterstone's Group like-for-like sales rose 6 4 per cent with Waterstone's 2 2 per cent ahead and HMV up 7 9 per cent HMV said sales of DVD and games which now account for 15 per cent of the group total had been strong Trading since the end of April had been erratic May was particularly strong for HMV Europe with an 11 3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales as it benefited from sales of Nintendo's GameCube and music releases from Eminem and Travis But in June HMV slowed to a 3 8 per cent sales rise while Waterstone's sales fell 1 7 per cent like-for-like In the US HMV is shrinking its portfolio which is now down to 10 outlets The group made a pre-tax profit of £48 6m £17 8m loss struck after £71m of finance charges in the year to April 27 There is no dividend Comment  Independent analysts had their first chance to quiz HMV yesterday and used it to question some accounting wrinkles including HMV's use of provisions already made for onerous US leases which had served to smooth profits These provisions boosted ebit by £3 2m last year although the benefit will drop to £1 7m this year Current trading is a slight worry though it could be a World Cup blip More encouraging was expansion at HMV Europe which now plans to open an additional 20-25 stores this year rather than 12 On current-year forecasts of £94m rising to £110m next the shares trade on p/e below 10 falling to just over 8 That is a discount to WH Smith on 11 times this year and a sector average excluding Marks and Spencer of 13 Having fallen much harder than the market in recent months HMV shows recovery appeal ,2
1998-04-03, A disappointing performance on exports is slowing Thailand's recovery from the economic crisis that struck after last July's devaluation of the baht Chuan Leekpai the prime Minister said in London yesterday Thailand's determined effort to restructure its banks and stabilise its economy has caused it to be held up by western creditors as a model Asian reformer and won Mr Chuan a hero's welcome on his recent visit to the US But yesterday the self-effacing democrat said Thailand still faced considerable challenges on the road to recovery Thai exports fell nearly 8 per cent in January compared with the same month of 1997 because of a severe shortage of liquidity facing local manufacturers The baht had now stabilised at a higher level and weak demand had kept inflation at present 9 5 per cent below the level predicted by the IMF Mr Chuan said But the government faced rising unemployment and social problems mitigated only partly by rising farm revenues as a result of higher rice prices The major problem we are facing with regard to exports is that of liquidity he added The banks are charging high interest rates and some banks do not have the funds to make loans  The US and Japan however had provided export credit and Thailand this week signed a $1bn £595m loan from the Asian Development Bank for that purpose Europe could institute similar measures Mr Chuan said He would ask European leaders at this week's Asia-Europe summit to facilitate the roll-over and rescheduling of Thailand's short-term debt Mr Chuan said he believed Japan's banking problems would not lead it to pull its investments out of the rest of Asia though he was concerned about its ability to absorb Asian exports because of its own weak economy There was also a continuing risk of loss of confidence spreading from Indonesia which required special handling The IMF had to recognise that Indonesia had unique problems with a large population spread over many islands Measures which have worked in other countries may not be the most suitable for Indonesia  The need to maintain food supplies to such a widely dispersed population required the existence of government monopolies he added Despite Thailand's weak exports Mr Chuan indicated it was still too early for a significant fall in interest rates for which business is increasingly pressing The IMF was prepared to allow a gradual reduction once the currency stabilised But it is not for the government to intervene It is up to the market mechanism ,3

2002-04-16, Alcatel shares surged yesterday after Europe's largest provider of telecommunications equipment quelled concerns about a profit warning by releasing details of its earnings ahead of schedule The French company due to publish first-quarter earnings on April 25 said preliminary figures showed a first-quarter net loss of about {XEU}850m $748m compared with a fourth-quarter loss of {XEU}1 5bn and a profit of {XEU}210m in the first quarter of 2001 the last time it reported a quarterly profit Separately Alcatel which has been divesting assets to help strengthen its balance sheet said it was selling its microelectronics division to STMicroelectronics Europe's largest semiconductor company for {XEU}390m in cash Alcatel shares gained 5 8 per cent to {XEU}15 27 leading a general rebound in the European technology sector Alcatel shares which have lost a fifth of their value this year came under further pressure last week when Nortel Networks its Canadian competitor warned that first-quarter revenues would be lower than anticipated Per Lindberg analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London described yesterday's share price recovery as a relief rally He added The market probably feared something like Marconi's Lucent's and Nortel's warnings but this was much tamer than that  Alcatel said revenues fell 32 per cent in the first quarter slightly more than anticipated Analysts said it highlighted the prolonged slump in demand and indicated that the rebound expected by Alcatel to start this half was still not visible Alcatel had a net operating cash flow of {XEU}300m in the first quarter allowing it to trim debt by a similar amount Its working capital requirements had fallen well below {XEU}6bn compared with {XEU}6 2bn at the end of last year The preliminary results showed that asset sales cost cuts and a squeeze on component purchases had allowed Alcatel to maintain margins in spite of the continued slowdown according to analysts Alcatel said part of its net loss reflected provisioning to cover unpaid contracts in its submarine cable business Alcatel recently disclosed that it would provision about {XEU}100m after supplying an undersea cable network in the Pacific to Flag Telecom which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week Meanwhile ST the Franco-Italian group said it would resell part of the Alcatel division it is buying to AMI Semiconductor for an unspecified amount Idaho-based AMIS will take over the mixed-signal business which accounts for about a third of the division's {XEU}350m of revenues ,2
2002-06-17, Poland may still be an economy in transition but as far as the markets are concerned it has long graduated from the emerging markets class The country which 10 years ago was known in capital markets for its Brady bond restructuring today is part of the eurozone convergence scene The prospect of the EU and the eurozone membership is the dominant theme that drives the pricing of Polish debt instruments according to Philip Poole chief emerging markets economist at ING in London Domestic politics and the issues of the Central Bank's independence are less important than negotiations between Poland and the EU on the remaining chapters As far as the markets are concerned Poland's accession to the EU and the Emu is aforegone conclusion Poland is expected to enter the EU in 2004 or 2005 and to join the single currency in 2007 As a result Poland's bonds are trading at tighter yield spreads than Italy's or Portugal's bonds traded before the introduction of the single currency However economists in Poland are less confident about their country's ability to meet the Maastricht criteria by 2007 Kasper Bartholdy chief emerging markets economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London says the markets have overshot and the risk of the accession process being delayed has not been factored in If Poland was judged out of the EU context it would not be trading at these levels he says Poland's external debt once a core of emerging market portfolios today mainly appeals to mainstream eurozone investors who are eager to pick up a few basis points in yield at a time when eurozone bond yields remain low The country's domestic debt which yields about 8 6 per cent on five-year bonds is of great interest to convergence funds As it moves closer to the EU interest rates presently at 9 per cent will have to come down thereby offering investors handsome returns on their investments The shift in investor base from emerging market investors to mainstream European institutions is the result of Poland's economic progress towards the EU as well as its active debt management Like many countries with restructured Brady debt Poland managed to change its debt profile by issuing international bonds in place of Brady bonds However in contrast to countries such as Bulgaria which simply offered investors to swap Brady bonds for new international bonds Poland has been buying Brady bonds in the market and issuing new debt By the end of last year Poland had bought back $3 3bn worth of Brady debt This has been a successful way of shifting an investor base because Poland was buying Brady bonds from emerging market investors and issuing new debt for convergence investors says Mr Poole Poland's bond markets have also been supported by the fast developing pension funds industry Part of the reason Poland's debt has been so stable over the past few years is that domestic pension funds have to hold the country's debt says Mr Bartholdy Moving away from dollar-denominated Brady bonds and into the euro-denominated international bonds is also important for attracting retail investors who normally do not buy complex instruments such as Brady bonds Widening its investor base should help Poland to refinance its external debt This is particularly important as the country approaches a peak period of external debt servicing payments due to rising amortisations on Paris Club debt says Mr Poole Poland must repay $20bn in principal on foreign currency debt which is equivalent to about 11 per cent of gross domestic product Refinancing these repayments will be the biggest challenge on the external debt front in the crucial convergence period he says However a shortage of higher yielding debt issuance in Europe should help Poland to tap the international capital markets There is also strong demand for Poland's equities both from international investors but particularly from domestic institutions But like in many other central and eastern European countries activity in the market has been limited by a small number of liquid stocks The market is still dominated by former state-owned companies such as TPSA the telecommunication company while new dynamic companies remain in private hands It is difficult to get exposure to the more dynamic part of Poland's economy through the stock market says Mr Poole Many foreign investors have sought exposure to Poland's corporate sector through venture capital funds Analysts hope that Poland's entry into the EU would help to encourage companies to list their shares on the European bourses ,2
2002-04-17, ExpressJet a regional airline carrier hopes to ride on the coat-tails of JetBlue's successful initial public offering when it makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow Texas-based ExpressJet a spin-off from Continental Airlines could attract strong investor interest after shares in JetBlue soared 67 per cent on their first day of trading ExpressJet hopes to raise as much as $416m by offering 26m shares priced at between $14 and $16 through Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney The deal had originally been set to float last September but was delayed because of the terrorist attacks The IPO was revived in February with its initial price target of $15-$17 lowered to $14-$16 but with its shares increased to 20m from 18 75m Salomon increased the number of shares again earlier this month to 26m However unlike JetBlue an independent company that used the proceeds from its IPO to expand its fleet of airlines ExpressJet will share its proceeds with Continental to repay its parent company's debt JetBlue's performance has certainly put more attention on it said Kyle Huske an analyst at IPO com It will try to gain momentum from JetBlue but whether it looks as enticing is questionable  Continental the fifth-biggest US carrier reported a net loss of $166m for the first quarter including special charges or a loss per share of $2 61 down from a net profit of $9m a year ago ExpressJet however posted a net income of $20m or $0 37 per share reflecting a 55 2 per cent increase from $12 9m net income in the first quarter of 2001 Ms Huske said This is a different type of offering than JetBlue which is a hot young company But the buzz is that it should still do pretty well ,2

1998-04-01, The confrontation between Greece's Socialist government and unions at Olympic Airways the loss-making state carrier deepened yesterday as airline workers demonstrated outside parliament in protest against draft legislation to cut costs The cost-cutting package which includes a three-year wage freeze longer working hours and a ban on overtime is intended to produce savings of Dr50bn $157m yearly over the next five years transport ministry officials said It is expected to result in some job losses as Olympic's workers will be required to sign individual agreements accepting the new working regulations The government resorted to legislative measures after talks between Olympic's management and unions broke down on Monday Olympic's unions called a three-hour work stoppage yesterday with backing from Greece's trade union confederation Transport ministry officials denied a report that Theodoros Tsakirides Olympic's chief executive had resigned after being harassed by militant protesters who stormed his office at the airline's headquarters The Socialists are committed to restructuring Olympic and three other loss-making state corporations which have accumulated heavy debts as part of the effort to qualify for membership of the European single currency by 2001 The government signalled yesterday that it would stand firm on public sector reform despite the dispute with Olympic's unions which have traditionally been strong supporters of Costas Simitis the prime minister and his moderate wing in the Panhellenic Socialist Movement Yannos Papantoniou economy minister said that similar legislative packages would be pushed through parliament if negotiations failed with unions at the Greek Post Office Hellenic Railways and the Athens bus company The three corporations have debts totalling more than Dr700bn Olympic was allowed to write off almost Dr500bn in debt in 1994 as part of a restructuring agreed with the EU However losses last year amounted to Dr6 5bn mainly because of salary increases averaging 20 per cent The government has threatened to shut down the airline if it fails to reach agreement with the 7000 workers on the restructuring and re-open it under a new charter If the crisis is prolonged Olympic will be in danger of losing control of profitable routes to the Greek islands this summer as domestic routes are due to be opened to international competition from July 1 ,3
2002-04-23, Even as credit conditions showed small signs of improvement global bond defaults hit a record $34bn in the first quarter indicating that many corporations are still struggling to rid themselves of heavy debts Telecommunications carriers continue to be most at risk with United Pan-Europe Communications Global Crossing McLeodUSA and Metromedia Fiber Network among the quarter's biggest defaulters according to Moody's Investors Service The default rate fell for the second consecutive month to 10 3 per cent in March but was still higher than expected The default rate although an important indicator of sentiment in the credit markets is mostly relevant to the high-yield or sub-investment grade sector For the investment-grade market the ratio of downgrades to upgrades is often more relevant and this also points to continued pressure on the credit outlook In the US there have been five downgrades of US companies to every upgrade in the year to date compared with a ratio of 2 9 to 1 last year according to Moody's In Europe the credit ratio rose to 20 5 from 1 7 in the first quarter of 2001 and an annual average of 4 4 according to Standard & Poor's The large numbers of downgrades must however be put in the context of a rapidly growing bond market especially in the US About $988bn of US bonds were downgraded in the 12 months ended March 2002 some 33 per cent of the $3000bn in outstanding rated corporate bonds In 2001 a similar 32 7 per cent of the market was downgraded Predicting when the ratio of downgrades to upgrades will reverse is difficult The ratio is a lagging indicator of economic recovery If Europe pulls out of recession in the second quarter you wouldn't expect downgrades to peak until the fourth quarter said Corinne Cunningham at Royal Bank of Scotland But although corporate earnings remain poor Moody's sees indicators that may help to lift the ratio by mid-year slower debt growth lower borrowing costs and debt refinancing The large gap between unfavourable and favourable outlook changes has also started to narrow In the second quarter there have been more favourable outlooks than unfavourable outlooks said John Puchalla senior economist at Moody's Gary Jenkinsat Barclays Capital also pointed to the increased incidence of positive event risk Yesterday's announcement by Ericsson of a SKr30bn share issue to boost its balance sheet was the latest example As far as the bond markets are concerned there are more positive than negative examples of event risk at the moment Mr Jenkins said ,2
2002-06-25, One of the first tasks of any new chief executive is to step out of the shadow of his predecessor For Burkhard Poschadel the German-born head of GAM the hedge fund specialist firm that has been quite a task His predecessor was Gilbert de Botton the group's erudite founder But Mr Poschadel a soft-spoken former academic and veteran of UBS the Swiss banking group that bought GAM three years ago says his appointment marked a break with the past He took over in 2000 after Mr de Botton who sold GAM to UBS for $675m died suddenly at the age of 65 Mr Botton had established GAM in 1983 with $1m of capital It quickly became known for its expertise in hedge funds and fund of hedge funds What remains is the business model but my style is very different from that of the founder Mr Poschadel says at GAM's London offices We are implementing a management structure that is no longer centred on one person  The new structure will be based on a seven-strong business committee including GAM's global divisional heads This team will report to the board of directors of GAM Holding a new Swiss holding company chaired by Hans de Gier who is also vice-chairman of UBS Mr Poschadel will be a member of the committee and the board His management reshuffle comes amid fierce competition within the global hedge fund industry Last month the UK's Man Group acquired Swiss rival RMF for $833m creating a company with almost $20bn of assets under management Mr Poschadel says GAM with its $17 6bn of assets will stay clear of overpriced acquisitions opting instead for organic growth The big question is who will be the Fidelity of the hedge fund world in five years' time he says Man and RMF are claiming this title and we will see a lot more of that  One of the battle grounds is the fast-growing market for fund of hedge funds a $100bn industry that Mr de Botton helped to create His idea was to persuade wealthy private clients to invest in funds that allocated money to top hedge fund managers In this way investors could spread their risk while reaching some of the finest stock-pickers This was an unfashionable idea since private clients were typically assigned a single fund manager But GAM's early entry to this market is paying off We have one of the longest track records in fund of hedge funds says Mr Poschadel and we have reached a size that allows us to reinvest revenues into the growth of our operation  Fund of hedge funds account for about 40 per cent of GAM's funds under management and play a vital part in its three business areas private client portfo lios institutional portfolios and mutual funds The stock market boom of the 1990s has led to an explosion in GAM's mutual fund business which accounts for almost half of its assets This says Mr Poschadel has created a need to rebalance the overall group His strategy is two-pronged First he is focusing on GAM's private client business which he expects to double to $9bn of funds under management by the end of 2004 He believes GAM will benefit from the emergence of a new generation enjoying the benefits of inherited wealth The new generation is even more sophisticated than the old one and is very open to our products including hedge funds he says Yet by returning to its private client roots GAM will be going head-to-head with the fund management businesses of traditional Swiss private banks which are locked in a bitter fight for market share This was illustrated by the merger this month of Lombard Odier and Darier Hentsch Mr Poschadel says GAM has no intention of entering private banking These banks are offering a comprehensive range of services whereas we want to remain a pure asset manager he says The firm already benefits from its relationship with UBS Private Banking whose clients account for a quarter of GAM's funds under management Mr Poschadel is confident that GAM will be able to retain its special status within UBS which recently integrated its collection of local fund management businesses including the UK-based Phillips & Drew under its UBS Global Asset Management brand What UBS bought two and a half years ago was not just $14bn of assets but a distinct business model and a brand he says If they were to integrate GAM it would destroy the business model  The second part of Mr Poschadel's strategy is to focus on the firm's institutional business which is expected to benefit from a growing interest in alternative investments amid poor equity returns Potential clients include pension funds in Switzerland the US and Canada with those in the UK expected as he puts it to put their toes into the water I think the perception that we have racy hedge fund products is wrong says Mr Poschadel Some of our fund of hedge funds have a lower volatility than the respective benchmarks  GAM prides itself on using rigorous screening methods including face-to-face interviews to pick and monitor its fund managers It invests in more than 100 different hedge funds with a third being replaced each year He concedes that industry-wide returns have been poor in the last two years One of the reasons was the lack of themes that managers could play on he says He believes that equity long/ short funds could still perform well in the medium term Yet for all his confidence in his strategies Mr Poschadel's mettle remains untested He may have left the shadow of his predecessor but he has yet to make a lasting difference to the business ,1
2002-06-12, With its capital base assured and a ring fence erected around the controversial financial guarantees on its property activities the first signs have emerged that Bankgesellschaft Berlin can start looking ahead after almost a year in which its future seemed behind it The threat of closure over Germany's ninth largest bank has been removed after a {XEU}2bn capital increase and the decision by politicians in the city state of Berlin Bankgesellschaft's 81 per cent owner to take on the injudicious guarantees it offered investors in much of its property portfolio Berlin's decision to underwrite last year's emergency capital increase allowed the bank to stay in business Its ring fencing enabled Bankgesellschaft to report a relatively modest {XEU}112m loss for last year rather than the {XEU}2bn shortfall that might have been recorded had the bank had to continue the massive provisions and writedowns which led to its {XEU}1 65bn loss in 2000 Meanwhile top management has been replaced with a new team committed to a turnaround while Bankgesellschaft's previously impenetrable organisational structure has been simplified The largely independent subsidiaries notably in real estate responsible for the lion's share of its problems have been brought under the main board's control A new much more modest business plan is being implemented with advice from Boston Consulting Group Former dreams of creating a financial powerhouse to rival Frankfurt's best have been replaced by a plan for a much smaller regional bank focusing on middle market commercial clients and retail banking Foreign subsidiaries are being sold representative offices closed and even the core branch network pruned The aim is to reduce annual administrative and personnel costs by {XEU}450m by 2005 largely by eliminating 4000 of the group's 16000 jobs If all goes to schedule Bankgesellschaft could be back in profit from 2004 according to Hans-Jorg Vetter its new chairman But even if some of the uncertainties surrounding the bank have been removed many remain In spite of its efforts to cut expenditure for example restructuring appears to be costing money at the moment Last year operating costs climbed more than 9 per cent to {XEU}1 83bn The consolidation programme is very ambitious and restructuring is not easy says Thilo Sarrazin Berlin's finance senator But we are on course in terms of cost reductions in the restructuring process  Commercially the business climate remains uncertain The entire banking sector has suffered from higher write-offs because of the economic slowdown With much of its activities concentrated in economically-depressed eastern Germany Bankgesellschaft has been particularly exposed Results for the first three months of this year showed an after-tax loss of {XEU}114m compared with a {XEU}28m shortfall in the same period last year Matters have been exacerbated by the demoralisation of its staff after the recent crises and the fact that bank officials admit they have adopted a much more cautious approach to new business than in the past The bank has enough capital now says Mr Sarrazin The question now is to ensure it is run more competently We are confident of that  He declines to comment on its operating activities which is up to management But he admits there is an altered credit policy when it comes to new business The biggest uncertainty of course concerns Bankgesellschaft's next owner Berlin put its stake in the bank formally up for sale in April after private discussions with a number of potential bidders Last month saw the admission of four bidders into the bank's so-called data room and Mr Sarrazin expects to be in a position to enter final talks with one or possibly two bidders by the end of July His hope is to conclude negotiations by October with a view to closing the deal early next year Almost taboo politically until a few months ago a sale has become much more likely now That is largely because of the changed mood of the city's leaders who now seem to regard the bank more as an encumbrance than the source of prestige and patronage it once represented among the main causes indeed of why it got into trouble in the first place ,2
2002-06-05, As fate would have it the first two new cars that cost-cutter Giancarlo Boschetti has introduced since becoming chief executive of Fiat Auto six months ago will probably never make money At this point we just want to bring back as much cash as possible with sales For their development what's spent is spent Mr Boschetti said yesterday as journalists inspected the Lancia Thesis a luxury saloon and the Lancia Phedra a luxury people-carrier at their launch in Turin Lancia's economics and many of its ills are symptomatic of Fiat Auto and its much larger Fiat and Alfa Romeo brands Even if cost-cutting at Fiat remains the group's toughest challenge efforts to revive Lancia will be closely watched Improving the brand's image and quality at home could help it regain some lustre abroad just as Fiat has managed to do with Alfa Romeo in recent years The decision to produce the Thesis and the Phedra were made while Mr Boschetti was still restructuring Iveco Fiat's truck division By last December when Fiat decided drastic changes were needed at the car division it was too late to cancel the Thesis and Phedra The curvaceous Thesis is meant to compete with BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's larger models but with projected sales of 25000 a year break-even is impossible Similarly about 6000 Phedras a year are expected to roll off an assembly line in France that produces similar vehicles for Peugeot Citroen and Fiat Such economics or lack of them have not been unusual at Fiat Indeed Lancia has never made money for the group since it saved the small but venerated brand from bankruptcy in 1969 Mr Boschetti however has been brought in to make sure such sentimentality is banished from the group In our plan there are no dreams just cost reductions And from what I've seen there is a hell of a lot of room for that he says During a frank presentation of Fiat Auto's ills with analysts three weeks ago and repeated to journalists yesterday Mr Boschetti outlined {XEU}600m $566m in cost savings this year alone and more next year in an effort to turn the unit around Fiat Auto he promised would break even next year even though most analysts are projecting an operating loss of up to {XEU}1bn this year Most of the improvement will come from the group's two larger car brands Fiat and Alfa Romeo But although Lancia produces only 135000 cars a year and sells mostly in Italy its problems are symptomatic of the group Fiat acquired Lancia when its executives considered themselves the national champions of Italian industry and labour and did not pay too much attention to the bottom line But a series of financial crises at Fiat meant it was unable to make the proper investments needed in Lancia and the marque's reputation began to evaporate with a succession of poorly designed and built cars The Thesis replaces the eight-year-old Kappa model whose lacklustre styling and numerous quality problems plagued it from its first day on the road People would go back to the dealer and not even want a replacement said Mauro Tedeschini editor of Quattroruote a leading Italy's motoring magazine Thesis almost started on the same wrong foot Unveiled last November the car was kept out of showrooms because engineers kept finding glitches in its complex electronic system The problem appears to have been solved though Lancia is promising first deliveries to arrive only in September ,2
2002-06-22, I guess that many of you owned several of the stocks that dropped out of the FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 in last week's quarterly reshuffle This is even though these stocks have usually been the worst performers for several months and hence drop out of the indices because they are no longer the 100 or next 250 largest companies in the UK I'm sure you owned them because those stocks were household names such as Logica ARM Telewest Marconi Psion Private investors are more likely to be net buyers of attention-grabbing stocks than are institutional investors according to new research  The list of most popular stocks traded via leading brokers includes these names Net traders continued to be lured by them even though the above five stocks alone have all fallen an average 60 per cent in three months Unfortunately it's not that private investors are being astute in buying such stocks There is scant evidence of detailed stock selection Attention-driven investors tend to be net buyers of the previous day's big losers that are in the news When Maria Bartiromo mentions a stock during the Midday Call on CNBC volume in the stock increases nearly 500 per cent on average  Private investors tend to be buying these stocks from institutional professional investors according to the research Well-informed institutional investors do not exhibit such attention-based buying Sadly for private investors those prone to engaging in attention-based buying do not benefit from doing so The research finds attention- grabbing stocks do not outperform the market nor do the high-profile stocks they buy outperform those they sell Investors should consider how they can avoid these stocks and improve their portfolio's performance If you own high profile poor performing stocks think about operating a system with automatic buy and sell signals so you circumvent attention-based buying For instance a new service by discount broker Hargreaves Lansdown called Midas generates automatic buy and sell signals when shares reach certain prices Quantigma which runs the service states the system has produced a 6 7 per cent net profit over the past year compared with a FTSE decline of 3 3 per cent Over the past four years the return would have been 60 per cent against a FTSE return of 13 per cent If you buy attention-grabbing stocks as a way of narrowing your search for investments after all there are 2000 stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange then consider instead becoming an expert on certain sectors and ignoring others For instance I rarely focus on biotechnology or pharmaceuticals for me it would mean too much additional research Although these poor performing stocks would have been a drag on any portfolio the answer to improved portfolio performance for the online trader is often right before them Try this simple experiment to see if you make a classic error associated with private investors List your stock portfolio holdings and their individual profit or losses to date Now write down next to each stock how long it has been in your portfolio Chances are you will have held the loss-making ones longer than the profitable ones  Private investors like to postpone the regret associated with realising a loss Analyse the portfolio data you already possess I calculate the average holding period for my profitable and my losing trades and then work out what would have happened if I held the loss- making trades for the same average period as I did the profitable ones Would I have been more profitable If so it may suggest a tendency to avoid taking losses Finally before you hit the buy button decide whether you would buy the stock if it were not in the news would you buy it on it's commercial strength alone Perhaps it is a sign of the times that in an age of instant fame manufactured 'pop stars' and others simply famous for being famous the stock market too mimics popular culture and the meaningless indeed costly attraction to fame becomes a reason to buy a stock alpesh@pathburner com  All that glitters the effect of attention and news on the buying behaviour of individual and institutional investors by Brad Barber University of California Davis and Terence Odean University of California Berkeley April 2002 draft http// faculty haas berkeley edu/ odean/papers/Attention/ All%20that %20Glitters%20 pdf  Market Efficiency in Real Time by Jeff Busse and Clifton Green 2002 forthcoming Journal of Financial Economics  Matt Grinblatt and Matti Keloharju What makes investors trade Journal of Finance 56 589-615 2001 My sites this week Broker's Client's Top 10 Buys and Sells Lists www schwab-europe com www etrade co uk Online Automatic Trading Systems UK www hl-midas co uk www mybroker co uk Software based systems UK and US www nirv com www equis com www tradestation com www synsoft co uk www indexia co uk,2
2002-06-06, Stephen Byers and the other ministers who lost their jobs last week could face an uphill struggle if they hope to land a lucrative board seat or consultancy analysis by the Financial Times suggests The rapidly growing band of MPs and peers who have left ministerial office since Labour came to power in 1997 includes fewer company directors than the Tory front bench Only five out of the 25 former cabinet or departmental Labour ministers who still sit in parliament have paid directorships compared with seven of the 26-strong shadow cabinet The chances of getting a highly paid job appear even worse Only three of the 25 declare regular employment paying more than £10000 a year in the latest registers of MPs' and peers' interests Excluding Lord Robertson the Nato secretary-general the rest of the 25 ex-ministers appear to have little or no regular outside work Not all are seeking other work however Many Labour MPs are content with their parliamentary salary and are uneasy about outside interests The only employment income declared by Chris Mullin the former international development minister is £1001-£5000 a year for a weekly column in the Sunderland Echo The apparent lack of an ex-ministerial gravy train reflects a fundamental change in the relationship between business and Westminster according to headhunters There's been a significant movement over the last 10 years away from having a politician on your board just because they're a politician said Stephen Bampfylde chairman of Saxton Bampfylde Hever the executive search company The world has moved on That skill set of having been a minister is not as attractive as it once was There are more sophisticated ways of getting political influence than just having a former minister on your board  Of the five former New Labour ministers who now hold company directorships three Jack Cunningham Baroness Jay and Peter Mandelson had a seat in the cabinet Some ministerial posts have stronger potential commercial value than others Chris Smith landed a £25001-£30000-a-year consultancy advising Disney on digital television only months after he was sacked as culture secretary a post that carried responsibility for the media sector Peter Mandelson has found a business market for his spin doctoring skills gaining a seat on the board of Clemmow Hornby Inge an advertising agency He also earns £10001-£15000 a year from a monthly column for GQ magazine Former ministers' links to industry have clear potential to generate controversy Jack Cunningham the former Cabinet Office minister came under fire last month when it emerged that he had worked for RBG Resources The metal trading company now in liquidation and under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office was a client of Mr Cunningham's political consult-ancy Brinkburn Associates Some former ministers manage to generate respectable portfolios of board appointments Baroness Jay a member of the new Labour committee that will vet party donations and former leader of the Lords is a non-executive director of British Telecommunications and of Independent News and Media She also has a consultancy contract with Amey Group Geoffrey Robinson the former paymaster-general has bounced back from the collapse of his company TransTec Mr Robinson is a non-executive director of Smart Technology Group a Midlands-based engineering company and of Torgram Developments a London waste management and consultancy company He remains a director of Coventry City Football Club But most ex-ministers have few reliable extra sources of income apart from fees for writing ,3

2002-06-11, The sale of John Murray the oldest independent publisher in Britain to Hodder Headline part of WH Smith resulted in much mourning last month Coming shortly after another independent publisher Harvill Press was absorbed by another media conglomerate Random House part of Bertelsmann countless commentators concluded that the sale of the 234-year-old publishing house home to literary greats such as Jane Austen and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle marked the death of independent publishing Independent middle-sized firms once considered the lifeblood of British publishing were in an impossible position concluded the analysts They lacked the flexibility of very small publishers but were too small to be players in the battles that define modern publishing they didn't have enough money to pay advances to attract authors and didn't have the clout to secure enough shelf space in shops for their books Everybody realises that small independent publishing is finite said chairman John Murray on the day of the sale We kept on being outbid by HarperCollins on books we wanted  But it's not all over yet Many of Britain's great independents may have merged sold out to giants like Random House and HarperCollins or gone bankrupt but there's one publishing house that resolutely refuses to do so Faber & Faber The Bloomsbury-based company which has published heavyweight writers including T S Eliot W H Auden William Golding Ted Hughes Philip Larkin and more recently Peter Carey Kazuo Ishiguro and Hanif Kureishi has operated independently for some 72 years and is convinced it can carry on being the master of its own destiny for the foreseeable future The firm's survival as an independent has been remarkable given that its literary achievements have never been matched by a great deal of financial or commercial literacy It hasn't traditionally been particularly good at promoting its writers it has suffered from bad internal systems and persistent IT problems and insiders admit there has long been an anti-money culture at the company with literary achievement always being prized above commercial considerations Indeed there is a widespread belief that Faber has only survived because of the royalties it receives from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats the show based on poems by T S Eliot and the longest-running musical in West End and Broadway history But things are changing Faber & Faber has for the past six months been run by a new chief executive who is determined to bring some business savvy to London's last great independent literary publishing house We need to create a company that values commercial ambition more highly says 37-year-old Stephen Page sitting in his smart office which with its sleek desk and sofa is more Terence Conran than Philip Larkin The cultural agenda here is extremely strong and the passion is authentic and we're not going to dilute that but we do need to become commercially successful as well as culturally successful  What Business being aligned alongside literary achievement at Faber Traditionally Faber writers have always been quick to protect the company from commercialisation In the 1980s Seamus Heaney famously reprimanded the marketing manager for saying that Faber was to poetry what Mills & Boon are to romance It bothered me that Faber T S Eliot's old firm was doing a striptease by marketing poetry as a product the poet said If you pursue the public in that way you're bound to lose your loyal readers   However Faber's writers and 65 staff together with assorted literary commentators have so far been entirely positive about Stephen Page's appointment This has a lot to do with his record Although his background is not in editorial but in sales and although he spent 15 months as sales and marketing director at HarperCollins UK part of the NewsCorp conglomerate the company he is most closely identified with is Fourth Estate a respected innovative independent which eventually sold out to HarperCollins in the summer of 2000 During his time at Fourth Estate Page earned himself a reputation as an inspired marketer pushing quality books that wouldn't normally sell many copies into the best-seller lists titles like Dava Sobel's Longitude Jean-Dominique Bauby's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and Simon Singh's Fermat's Last Theorem Nobody at Faber would mind if some of Fourth Estate's famous marketing panache rubbed off on the company The one thing that Faber writers need is better marketing says Erica Wagner The Times's literary editor and author of Ariel's Gift a book published by Faber exploring the powerful relationship between Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath both of whom were Faber writers I've had doubts about how they have marketed some of their authors in the past great writers like Tobias Hill and Paul Watkins come to mind It wouldn't have done them any damage if they had been presented in a less highbrow way In the past the aggressive marketing of books has been seen as a bit of a sin at Faber  And marketing will indeed be Page's priority He has spent his first few months trying to work out what needs changing and last month he appointed Noel Murphy formerly promotions manager at Waterstone's into the newly-created post of head of marketing If there's big vacuum at Faber it's marketing We haven't shouted loud enough about some of the things that Faber are really good at The overall plan is to publish a bit less fewer than the 200 new books a year we currently publish but market what we do publish better We need to put more energy and time and creativity into publishing the books that we have  The most striking element of this marketing revolution will be a change in the design of Faber's books Between the 1930s and 1960s when T S Eliot was on board as a literary editor the look of Faber's books was highly distinctive due to the firm's in-house designer Berthold Wolpe The design went through a flat period in the 1960s and 1970s but in 1982 Faber chairman Matthew Evans now Lord Evans commissioned design group Pentagram to revamp Faber's branding resulting in a highly distinctive classic look which gave its double-f logo prominence But Page believing that customers really do judge books by their covers argues that this distinctive design now puts off new readers and he has therefore decided to make Faber's 20-year relationship with Pentagram non-exclusive The first non-Pentagram- designed book Mark Urban's The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes is due out next month The Pentagram design was incredibly successful Faber has very high customer recognition probably second only to Penguin but there's a riot of good design in book shops and you really have to work hard to get people's attention Page says Each book has to go out and speak to the market it is for So we will use other designers apart from Pentagram where appropriate When it comes to our new authors and new books we really have to up the stake in terms of commercial design we are battling it out in a very tough marketplace and there a lot of readers out there for whom Faber's book design is currently a tad forbidding Maybe Faber hasn't reached as wide a readership as it could do  Elsewhere Page has plans to build the non-fiction division of Faber something that Fourth Estate managed to do very quickly when he was there Non-fiction is real target for us At the moment our non-fiction division turns over a quarter of what our fiction turns over The general fiction division is Faber's biggest division at the moment accounting for around half of the annual turnover Our goal must be to make the non-fiction division as big as the fiction division The market for non-fiction has broadened in recent years particularly in areas like history and science It has become sexy Lots of publishers have tried to imitate Fourth Estate's initial success in the area but I think that Faber because of its independence size and irreverence is in a better position than most to do it well  Page also plans to grow Faber's children's book division doubling it in size over a period of two to three years and wants the publisher to broaden the range of books it takes on I think we need to loosen up a bit people think we're a little bit stuffy a little bit Oxbridge but we're not that we're a publisher of quality writing So we need to have quality intelligent thrillers we need to have more quality intelligent women writers We need to carry on being selective but we could do with broadening our focus a bit  But equally there are many things that Page insists he will not change he says he will protect Faber's reputation for publishing only quality writing and will ensure that Faber continues to publish lots of drama film scripts and poetry In the short-term Page aims to get Faber making profits on a regular rather than occasional basis The latest figures will give him some hope although Faber lost L1 6m in the year ending March 2001 on turnover of L11 9m it is estimated that Faber will return to profit in the year to end March 2002 on a turnover of L12 7m Page stresses that Cats is not as important a revenue stream to Faber as people think the musical only contributed around 3 per cent of revenues in the year ending March 2002 People suggest that somehow Cats bankrolls Faber and that Faber is in some sense commercially negligent but it's not true In some years Cats has been the factor that influences whether we make money or not but that's all  Nevertheless the fact that Faber is no longer getting money from a London production of Cats the second highest grossing musical of all time closed in London last month means that there is added impetus to get Faber into financial order But whatever happens selling Faber is not an option says Page Just under 50 per cent of the firm's shares are owned by the Faber family's holding company and a similar percentage are owned by T S Eliot's 75-year- old widow

2002-06-14, Investors in Tyco International are preparing to help avert a financial crisis at the Bermuda-based conglomerate by supporting the initial public offering of its CIT financial services subsidiary Several large Tyco shareholders said yesterday they expected to place orders for CIT stock in an effort to ensure the success of the IPO which is designed to raise funds to ease its parent company's heavy debts CIT executives will today hold presentations in New York at the start of a three-week roadshow The company is planning to raise $5bn-$5 8bn from the IPO which is expected to be completed by July 1 Although many investors are wary of CIT Tyco shareholders are concerned that a failed IPO would further harm their Tyco stock which has lost almost 80 per cent of its value since the beginning of the year Tyco needs the proceeds of the IPO to reduce its debt burden and avoid possible bankruptcy People familiar with the matter said Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers joint bookrunners on the IPO are likely to target existing Tyco shareholders as they attempt to complete the offering Tyco shares jumped yesterday following the Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to allow the company to proceed with the CIT offering The shares closed up $3 65 or 35 per cent at $13 80 The rebound came as Tyco's caretaker chief executive called a halt to some of the troubled industrial group's more extravagant corporate indulgences by moving out of its prime Manhattan office and putting the company's five jets and one helicopter up for sale In a clear break with the swashbuckling era of former chief executive Dennis Koz-lowski who was indicted on charges of tax evasion last week lead director John Fort unveiled plans to consolidate office space and close several departments with the loss of about 115 jobs Mr Fort said Tyco would vacate its plush corporate office in mid-town Manhattan in favour of a more modest location on Fifth Avenue a few blocks from the $18 5m apartment the company purchased on Mr Kozlowski's behalf The company will also close or relocate other offices in London Luxembourg and New Hampshire High stakes Page 18 www ft com/tyco,2
2002-06-21, Amid all the hullabaloo around the re-opening of the market for initial public offerings in Europe recently one group of investors has been unusually quiet Leveraged buy-out specialists have watched the cancelled flotations and disappointing debuts as closely as anyone else But their silence has kept one of the most dramatic stories in the financial markets out of the public eye The European LBO market is suffering from a mismatch of historic proportions too much money invested with too few ways to generate a reasonable return The result is that with some notable exceptions LBO specialists are stuck in purgatory and there is little evidence to suggest they will escape soon Fuelled by growing interest in private equity in Europe in the late 1990s LBO investors are sitting on an enormous pile of cash Although the {XEU}40bn in funds that the European Venture Capital Association believes is waiting to be invested is far less than the $100bn in the US it is still large by historic standards There is a significant and increasing problem of fund overhang says Anu Gautam of Brask & Company a boutique investment bank Raising cash hasn't been the problem  There is little reason to believe that this is changing Candover Investments a UK buy-out group just raised {XEU}2 7bn for acquisitions in Europe We got a larger amount than we had expected says Simon Leefe investment director at Candover The group has already acquired Swissport the ground handling business of collapsed airline Swissair and Wellington Underwriting a UK insurance company this year Banks are still willing to put up debt financing albeit at lower earnings multiples With all this money to be invested the people that back LBOs are expecting results in short good returns on their money Private equity houses also need to justify the management fees they receive As a result there is a long line of LBO specialists hoping to get out of their investments This is not proving easy Traditionally there were three ways an investor could get out taking the company public selling it to trade buyer or passing it on to another financial buyer Trade sales have been the most common representing 136 out of 278 buy-outs in 2000 followed by financial sales according to data from the Centre for Management Buy-out Research Barclays Private Equity and Deloitte & Touche Last year the number of buy-out targets that went into receivership exceeded the number of trade sales for the first time in at least a decade The initial public offerings market just emerging from a two-year slumber is a less attractive exit option because institutional investors are increasingly conscious of the danger of over-paying in an economic slowdown Trade and financial sales suffer from the same problem Selling to a financial buyer also risks giving the appearance of antique dealers passing a table on to the next dealer for a higher price according to Tom Lamb of Barclays Private Equity The situation has affected the market in three ways First it has allowed good cash-generative companies to maintain relatively high valuations Because there is so much money sloshing around the private equity pool I don't think valuations will really come down unless the recession really bites says one investor It has also forced investors to be more patient Vendors have high price expectations private equity players have low price expectations It's taking months to complete deals as people's views of the world come together says Candover's Mr Leefe This applies not just to bids to invest in companies but to exit from them The standard three to five year term in which private equity investors looked to exit is turning into six to eight years in some cases Many in the LBO market believe this trend is here to stay Private equity investors are going to have to face the fact that they will need to keep businesses for longer and dress them up for sale better than in the past says Bob Ward a partner at Pricewaterhouse Coopers who advises private equity groups But all hope is not lost Although it has not been pretty a growing number of LBOs are exiting The Carlyle Group recently made the first exit from its {XEU}1bn European buy-out fund when it sold its stake in Le Figaro the newspaper company to Socpresse Industri Kapital took Alfa Laval the Swedish equipment and engineering group public in May Barclays Private Equity and 3i sold Go the low-cost airline to rival EasyJet and Apax is poised to exit from Yell the directories business Goldman Sachs sold Westminster Senior Living a nursing home group to 3i through an LBO Some observers believe these exits point the way to greater differentiation among buy-out specialists in Europe still a relatively young market What is going to happen which hasn't happened is that there will be a quality diversion between funds says Toby Boyle head of private equity in Europe for Henderson Private Capital ,2

2002-06-28, Accounting irregularities have been discovered at Kwik-Fit the car servicing business founded by Sir Tom Farmer and sold to Ford Motor Company of the US for $1 6bn £1bn three years ago The news is likely to delay Ford's plans to sell the business and further depress the sale price Ford had hoped to achieve at least £800m but potential bidders including UK private equity groups CVC Apax and Permira are understood to be negotiating a price of about £300m The decline in part reflects the decline in the European car repair market The irregularities come at a time when investors are uneasy about accounting practices after the collapse of Enron the energy trader and revelations at WorldCom the telecommunications group During due diligence for the auction Ford was warned by its auditor PwC that liabilities had been understated in Kwik-Fit's accounts by £3 4m In effect Kwik-Fit was receiving goods from suppliers but failing to account for the cost as invoices had not yet been sent This had the effect of boosting profits In a confidential document obtained by the Financial Times PwC Ford's auditor states Kwik-Fit Great Britain's senior finance team were posting inappropriate entries to the stock accrual accounts which served to reduce the liability for stock accruals  The document codenamed Project Silverstone goes on to say Based on the calculated stock accrual for goods received not invoiced management believe that Kwik-Fit Great Britain stock accrual at 31 December 2001 was understated by £3 4m  Ford asked PwC to prepare a report on the financial affairs of Kwik-Fit on December 7 last year By late January Kwik-Fit believed it had identified an understatement of liabilities by £1 5m and consequently asked PwC to prepare additional information Les Morton Kwik-Fit's director of internal audit assisted PwC in its investigation Ford declined to comment yesterday on whether the alleged accounting irregularities would disrupt the proposed sale However it said We continue to proceed with the sales process  Sir Tom founded Kwik-Fit in 1971 and the business quickly became a household name after its catchy television advertising campaign You can't get quicker than a Kwik-Fit fitter The chain employs 11500 people worldwide Last night Sir Tom was said to be unaware of the discovery or any allegations of financial misstatement He has severed all operational ties with Kwik-Fit pending completion of the disposal The sale could embarrass Goldman Sachs which advised Ford to buy Kwik-Fit Goldman declined to comment Additional reporting by Tim Burt Flagship failure Page 28,2
2002-04-22, The first round of France's closely fought presidential election last night looked set to be marred by an unprecedented level of abstention With two candidates long earmarked as the men most likely to contest the second round outgoing President Jacques Chirac on the right and premier Lionel Jospin on the left almost one in three voters opted yesterday to stay away from the polling booths For the first time under the Fifth Republic voters were going to the polls in the two-round contest to choose a head of state with a mandate reduced to five years from seven The other key novelty was the vote being held in co-ordination with general elections in June Political leaders of all main parties in the run-up to yesterday's vote said they hoped the outcome would not lead to another co-habitation But the decline in both Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin's popularity and the fragmentation of political parties made it harder to predict whether the electorate would chose a parliament of the same political colour as the president The high abstention rate among France's 40m electorate had been reflected in surveys of opinion throughout a campaign with 16 presidential candidates that had failed to generate enth-usiasm among the general public The main attention last night centred on two aspects of the first round the personal scores of Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin and the size of the vote for Jean-Marie Le Pen the leader of the far-right National Front and the sole person thought to be able to dislodge the two principal figures If Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin were to go through to the second round in two weeks time this would be a repeat of the 1995 presidential contest The prospect of seeing the 69-year-old president and the 64-year-old premier fight the same battle after a five co-habitation has been a big element in voter disaffection With Mr Chirac facing less of a challenge from candidates on the right in the first round analysts said any score below 18 per cent would leave him vulnerable in his bid to retain the presidency on May 5 On the left the seven minor candidates were expected to draw away support from Mr Jospin But analysts said any vote below 17 per cent would make it hard for him to recoup momentum for the run-off especially if Mr Chirac acquired a significantly larger share of the vote By early evening pollsters estimated the final turnout would be between 27 and 29 per cent This would be a significant increase on the 21 per cent abstention rate in 1995 If the pollsters predictions in the run-up to the vote prove accurate at least 60 per cent of all votes cast will go to the 14 minor candidates A French presidential election has never seen such a large field encouraging a first round vote from the heart with little indication of how people would show their allegiance in the decisive second round www ft com/france2002,3
2002-06-21, Moody's Investors Service yesterday raised the ratings for seven South Korean banks following an increase in the sovereign rating and reflecting what the US rating agency called significant restructuring at the banks The move follows its March upgrade of South Korea's sovereign rating by two notches to A3 and subsequent re-rating of four government-owned banks to the same level Moody's said The banks have undergone significant internal restructuring and reforms that have increased operational efficiencies and improved operating conditions Moreover balance sheets have been moderately repaired through the clearing of problem assets and recapitalisations  Korean banks especially compared to their Asian neighbours who similarly suffered huge rises in bad debts following the financial crisis of 1997 and 1998 have made big strides in cleaning up their balance sheets Consolidation has also helped reduce the number of banks although foreign banks have mostly dropped off the lists of prospective buyers largely due to an unwillingness to pay the prices sought by the government Investors' growing optimism on Korean banks has been reflected in the sector's bond spreads which have tightened from around 700 to 800 basis points over US Treasuries earlier this year to between 200 and 300 basis points However some concerns remain Standard & Poor's has been less aggressively optimistic retaining some non-investment grade weightings on some banks says Alison Murray regional bank analyst fixed income research at Merrill Lynch She says The banks have done a lot to clean up balance sheets and improve risk management systems but I do also agree there are still a lot of areas that do need to be addressed and a lot of these changes are a little untested  Chief among these are question marks over the extent to which banks are making lending decisions on a commercial basis Repeated bail-outs of Hynix the debt-ridden chipmaker by the banks suggest that poor lending decisions continue There are also concerns over the classification and provisioning of bad loans for example not all banks have taken conservative provisioning over their Hynix exposure Moody's itself cautions The challenges of fully commercialising the banking operations and creating strong independent risk management systems remain risk factors for these banks  The banks affected are mostly private banks but also include Korea First Bank which is controlled by Newbridge Capital of the US and state-owned SeoulBank which the government is now seeking to sell It aims to name a buyer from a six-strong shortlist next month ,1
2002-06-11, Parts of Merrill Lynch's $100m settlement with Eliot Spitzer New York attorney general were thrown into doubt yesterday because of concerns about the lack of compensation for investors who claim they lost money as a result of investing in stocks recommended by Merrill analysts State securities regulators in Missouri and South Dakota are considering backing out of the deal which could force Mr Spitzer and Merrill to renegotiate the financial terms of the agreement The overall structural terms of the deal including recent changes made by Merrill to its research oversight are not expected to be affected however We are continuing to review the matter said Douglas Ommen securities commissioner of Missouri We are concerned about the fact that there is no provision for investors  Officials from South Dakota did not return calls but the state is believed to have similar doubts Merrill last month agreed to make changes to its analyst research department and pay $100m to be divided between New York and the 49 other states The settlement was in response to charges brought by Mr Spitzer that the firm's research analysts had conflicts of interest with the investment banking side of the business New York State was expected to receive about $48m of the fine with the rest to be divided among the other states The agreement was controversial however because it did not include provisions for payments to investors Other state securities regulators expressed hopes yesterday that Missouri and South Dakota could be made to agree in the end but that was far from certain It is understood that Mr Spitzer's office has received assurances from 48 of the 50 states that they would back its agreement with Merrill However even if one state decided not to go along with the terms it could force a reworking of the financial terms It could also throw open the possibility that those states that do not follow Mr Spitzer may be able to launch their own claims against Merrill www ft com/banking,2
2002-06-10, The post-Enron shadow is stretching further into the world economy Among the sectors to suffer as a result of the collapse of the once high-flying US energy trader is the world power generation equipment industry which a year ago was benefiting from an extraordinary boom Last month the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released documents which indicated Enron and possibly other US energy traders such as Reliant Resources and Dynergy may have manipulated the 2000-01 Californian energy crisis through dubious trading activities that artificially pushed up electricity prices In other words illicit actions in the deregulated US energy industry may well have accentuated the indications in California and other western US states of power shortages The shortages were among the factors that stimulated a remarkable burst in orders from 1998 for power stations in the US that benefited much of the generation equipment industry The commodity produced by power generating equipment electricity is vital for economic growth But this year orders for power equipment in the US are expected to show a big fall to the dismay of the world's big generator machinery producers In 2000 more than 150GW 150000MW of equipment orders for power turbines were recorded around the world with roughly half of that figure coming from the US Last year equipment orders worldwide fell to about 120GW and this year the figure will be about 90GW with as little as 5GW to 10GW of this coming from the US according to industry forecasts Earl Nye chairman of TXU a Dallas-based energy company says the US power industry is in turmoil Looking back it is evident that the expansion in orders from 1998 to last year was an abnormality that could not be sustained he says With Enron bankrupt and other US energy traders having suffered sharp falls in their share prices confidence in the US electricity business is now at rock bottom The downturn in the industry in the US is also linked to the overall weaknesses in the US economy that have become evident over the past year exacerbated by September 11 The boom in activity in power generation in the US gave a boost to the world's three largest suppliers of electricity production equipment the US's General Electric GE Alstom of France and Siemens of Germany A fourth important player Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan has only a small amount of business in the US All four companies are part of a global power machinery industry with total revenues including service contracts and sales of spare parts of more than $100bn a year This year according to projections from Alstom Asia is likely to account for slightly over a third of the total orders Europe just under a quarter and South America one-sixth Given the poor outlook for orders all the main companies are increasingly relying on services such as maintenance and repair work on existing power stations as a way to stabilise revenues and profits The power divisions of General Electric Alstom and Siemens all gain at least 30 per cent of their power revenues from services and are likely to increase this in the next few years The company likely to be hardest hit by the fall-off in US orders is General Electric the industrial conglomerate that is by some way the biggest supplier of power machinery and services Last year GE's power systems division had sales of $202bn with an operating profit of $4 9bn The 24 per cent operating margin was a long way ahead of the comparable figures for Alstom and Siemens which had 4 per cent and 7 per cent respectively The division's heady growth since 1998 when it had sales of $8 5bn and an operating profit of $1 1bn has been an important factor behind the good financial performance over this period across GE as a whole But earnings for the division look likely to decline sharply in the light of the big fall off in orders this year and next in the US for gas turbines The latter are easily the most popular type of generating system in the US and in which in recent years General Electric has had a dominant world market share of about 50 to 60 per cent GE recently took the bold step of releasing its own projections for its power division showing that operating profits are likely to fall from $5 9bn this year to $4 4bn next year and $3 6bn in 2004 Of GE power systems' revenues last year about 40 per cent came from sales of gas turbines and related products Putting as brave a face as possible on the turn of events John Rice president of GE's power systems division says the company is pursuing potential growth areas for gas turbines outside the US The US market will have more manufacturing capacity than is required over the next few years But there are some encouraging growth prospects in other parts of the world Europe and South America he says Mr Rice promises especially a strong marketing push by the company in Europe In Europe our activity in power equipment has in the past tended to be understated and from now on I want it to be overstated he says Alstom the second biggest energy equipment company with sales last year in this field of E12bn to a large degree missed out on the gas turbine boom in the US This was a result initially of a lack of product offerings and then technical problems with a series of gas turbines sold by Alstom since 1999 which had previously been developed by ABB of Switzerland But Nick Salmon vice-president at Alstom points to the company's strengths in other parts of its equipment portfolio which he says is broader than that of the other big companies One example is low-power gas turbines of less than 100MW suited for providing electricity for factories and other industrial premises where Alstom is seeing growing opportunities Also Alstom is the world leader in steam turbines used either on their own to generate electricity using coal or oil as a fuel or in what is called a combined cycle plant as a second stage to a gas turbine Siemens' power equipment subsidiary last year had sales of E8 4bn It has recently stepped up its operations in the US as a result of its 1997 acquisition of the generating machinery business of Westinghouse It is now a strong number two to GE in gas turbines worldwide with a market share estimated at about 25 per cent that it would like to increase to 30 per cent according to Klaus Voges head of Siemens' power equipment operations While the fall off in orders in the US is to some degree a problem for Siemens the company sees encouraging prospects in parts of the world such as Vietnam and Taiwan in Asia as well as Spain and Italy in Europe As for profitability Mr Voges is sufficiently confident to say that this year the division will achieve a ratio of operating earnings to sales of above 10 per cent a good figure by the standards of other Siemens divisions GE Alstom and Siemens are all putting more effort into developing and selling machines for generating relatively small amounts of electricity which are seeing increasing use in so-called distributed power systems These are used in areas such as producing electricity for individual factories or groups of homes that are not linked to conventional electricity grids In this end of the market Caterpillar the US construction machine company is an important player Caterpillar's diesel and gas-driven engines for power generation provided it with revenues of $2 3bn last year more than 10 per cent of the company's total sales ,2
2002-06-22, Shares in Babcock Borsig dropped nearly 50 per cent yesterday as the German engineering group's financial woes intensified It confirmed it would be unable to pay workers unless talks with banks over {XEU}200m $193m in fresh financing were successful by Tuesday However observers say Babcock stands a good chance of winning backing from the banks I think the banks will be keen to support the company said Dirk Lohmann analyst at HSBC He said WestLB a long-term shareholder and board representative at Babcock was almost certain to help the company The company's latest troubles stem from losses blamed on economic weakness in Germany In March it also sold its stake in the profitable HDW shipyard to US investment fund One Equity Partners for about {XEU}350m as part of a restructuring Analysts say the current liquidity squeeze was predicted although its severity came as a surprise The collapse of Babcock a member of the M-Dax mid-cap index would be the latest in a string of high-profile bankruptcies ahead of Germany's elections in September It would also be the second within a month of a company on Germany's second share index Babcock shares were 49 per cent lower at {XEU}1 70 by late yesterday They were above {XEU}9 before the HDW sale news in March Even if insolvency can be staved off however the company's troubles will continue The sale of the HDW stake has been controversial as the world's largest maker of conventional submarines was widely seen as Babcock's crown jewel News of the disposal which reduces the group essentially to its loss-making power engineering units triggered a collapse in the share price in March The group is considering cutting its 22000-strong workforce by 1000 Including the extraordinary gains from the HDW sales Babcock's operating result is expected to just break even this financial year The company has acknowledged that this means a group loss of several million euros Market talk is that it could be as much as {XEU}500m Shareholders will decide at an extraordinary meeting in August what to do with the remaining 25 per cent stake in the shipyard Babcock's institutional shareholders are likely to support the sale as it boosts the cash-strapped company's coffers But the issue is strongly opposed by other shareholders notably Guy Wyser-Pratte the US corporate raider who owns 8 per cent of Babcock ,2

2002-04-30, The independence of the remaining British-owned regional electricity supply companies Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern is under threat amid a wave of takeovers and mergers The two companies are the only survivors of the 14 autonomous regional supply companies floated when the industry was privatised in the early 1990s Since then transactions worth almost £65bn including last week's agreed merger between the national electricity and gas transmission networks have been announced When Seeboard the supplier to south-east England owned by AEP of the US is sold this summer six companies three of them continental European and one from the US will control the original 14 suppliers It seems unlikely that Scottish Power which reports its results tomorrow and Scottish & Southern will be left undisturbed Either could be vulnerable to a takeover approach from the losers of the Seeboard auction say bankers The most likely predators are Electricite de France Eon of Germany and TXU of the US none of which have obtained the critical mass in terms of numbers of UK customers they would like All three along with Scottish & Southern have been short-listed by AEP However the appetite of foreign investors for UK power is mixed Although politicians and industry regulators have placed few obstacles in the way of foreign takeovers increased competition means lower prices and reduced returns for investors AEP is the latest of the early US investors to sell up At one time US companies owned eight of the 14 regional electricity companies By this summer only TXU owner of the Eastern and Norweb supply businesses will remain The two Scottish companies also need to increase their UK customer base but lack the deep pockets of their continental European rivals Conventional thinking among suppliers is that at least 5m customers are required to thrive in the rapidly consolidating UK energy market An alternative would be to arrange a no-premium merger between the two companies The retention of an even larger Scotland-based energy company would satisfy the sensitivities of voters north of the border an important consideration for Westminster politicians It would also create a national champion to rival EdF Eon TXU and Germany's RWE which this year agreed a £10bn deal to buy Innogy owner of Midlands Yorkshire and Northern regional supply businesses The Scottish companies have performed very differently recently Scottish Power's shares have fallen from a peak of 658p in December 1998 to close at 395p yesterday down 1p Ian Russell chief executive has come under fire for the poor performance of the company's accident-prone US energy business PacifiCorp bought for £3 8bn in 1998 Investors have also expressed dissatisfaction over the recent handling of the £2 05bn sale of its UK water business which will significantly reduce dividends from next year Scottish & Southern by contrast has seen its shares climb from 319{1/2}p at the beginning of 1997 to close at 675{1/2}p yesterday up 1{1/2}p It has been led by Jim Forbes chief executive a longstanding electricity industry executive with a reputation as an efficient manager Mr Forbes 55 surprised observers in March when he announced he would stand down this year One explanation was that he had taken the company as far as he felt it could go in the current climate This raises the question of who would take the top job should bankers attempt to broker a merger between the two companies with Scottish Power's chief executive currently struggling to win back investor confidence Either way it is difficult to see the Scottish companies remaining single If there is no Scottish merger Britain will be left with only one potential national champion Centrica to compete in Europe's emerging electricity and gas markets Centrica which trades as British Gas has opted not to buy a UK regional electricity supplier It has found it cheaper to develop this side of its business organically It now has 5 4m electricity and 13 4m gas customers Critics say Britain's determination to pursue free competition by preventing UK energy companies from developing dominant positions has delivered the industry into the hands of powerful foreign predators Should Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern decide not to join forces the chances are that one or both could go the same way ,1
2002-04-04, In the rapidly changing vocabulary of international economicdevelopment good government and localownership of policy have replaced structural adjustment and conditionality as jargon du jour The rationale behind this new language is that governments committed to good policies will better use development assistance than governments of kleptocrats True enough but this is not terribly useful if we are serious about helping the poor of the world since most of them live in countries that are miserably governed And countries that are well governed generally do well without development aid Most fundamentally appeals to corrupt officials to mend their ways are unlikely to trigger a conversion In fact it makes little sense to judge the success of aid policy only by the success of projects financed by aid The central problem in poorly governed countries is to allow room for people to make some money by engaging in productive activities Success of aid policy should be measured not by repayment of development bank loans few will be nor by the profitability of particular projects many are white elephants Rather aid should be viewed as the price of admission to the policy-making process and success should be judged by more modest criteria has the aid regime contributed to opportunities for people to work and invest productively If aid donors are able to do something as elementary as twisting the arm of policy-makers to stop harassing producers the transfers of aid may have worked far better than project results will ever show No country better illustrates the success of aid under such politically unpromising conditions than Bangladesh In Transparency International's latest corruption sweepstakes Bangladesh finished last in a field of 91 Bangladesh which an expatriate colleague of mine contemptuously described in the mid-1980s as a place where you can buy a minister for a carton of cigarettes now features corrupt practices on a much grander scale And yet the economy has grown at about 4 5 per cent a year since 1980 and about 5 per cent since 1990 Over the past 20 years fertility the average number of children per woman has dropped from 6 1 to 3 2 No single change in the economy is more responsible for this transformation than the development of the ready-made garment export industry From essentially nothing in 1977 when 19 companies formed a trade association the garment export sector has expanded to 2700 companies employing about 1 5m workers These are hard jobs with low pay and often dangerous working conditions Many children have been employed in the garment factories but most of the employees are young women who would otherwise most likely be married with very very few options The explosive growth of the garment industry is a direct product of foreign aid Bangladesh's first government under Mujibur Rahman the father of the country was deeply committed to the bureaucratic socialism characteristic of south Asia Every private investor had to demonstrate that his project was consistent with national plans Investment sanctioning was an important source of income for officials in the Department of Industry This was not a country where a good idea could easily be converted into a factory At the insistence of aid donors notably the World Bank Bangladesh created a list of free sectors In these industries a person with his own source of foreign exchange no questions asked could import machinery and simply begin to produce without foreign exchange authorisation with streamlined import licences and most importantly without an investment sanction None of the free sectors had notable economic activity when they were created Significantly their creation did not threaten functionaries' existing income streams What they did permit was rapid relatively undisturbed growth of new sectors through private exploitation of profitable opportunities The creation of a list of free sectors outweighs all the money squandered on bad projects in Bangladesh Aid donors can take a large piece of the credit for the transformations that flow from the explosive growth of the garment industry in Bangladesh Of course ultimately the workers and entrepreneurs of Bangladesh made it happen But aid-directed policy enabled entrepreneurs to invest productively and workers to find new opportunities So what are the lessons First aid should not be conditioned on the existence of good partner governments Second donors should insist on policy that relaxes government-imposed distortions Last aid policy should press for measures that create opportunities for productive activity but that do not challenge too directly the corrupt income of powerful officials Good policy under difficult conditions should be seen as the product of a successful aid programme rather than a precondition for it The writer is a senior fellow at The Century Foundation,3
2002-06-13, Bill Ford chairman of the company bearing his name is pushing through a quiet boardroom upheaval at the world's second largest manufacturer of motor vehicles At next month's board meeting in Dearborn the Detroit suburb dominated by Ford's world headquarters the directors will be presented with a new series of performance measures designed to track the group's $9bn restructuring Key managers involved in driving through capacity cutbacks plant closures and new product programmes will be invited to address the board directly openly discussing strategy rather than submitting formal reports Bill is trying to get much more informality into the board to talk about the real issues according to one official The directors are being exposed to more detail and analysis more awkward questions are being asked  In the Dearborn boardroom Mr Ford has even dispensed with the physical trappings of the old formality The pre-assigned seating that saw directors such as Sir John Bond of HSBC or Jorma Ollila of Nokia always in the same place has been abandoned It is says one executive a far cry from the dry tightly-controlled board atmosphere encouraged by Alex Trotman chairman for most of the 1990s and Jac Nasser the chief executive ousted last October Unlike them Bill is coming to this not as an executive who climbed his way through the company with a determination to defend himself at all costs says one Ford insider Bill also represents the biggest shareholder with a right to ask hard questions and demand more transparency  Given that Ford lost $5 45bn last year and saw its share price fall by almost half board members have interpreted Mr Ford's change of tone as a mandate to test the turnround strategy more aggressively At the last board meeting directors told Mr Ford and Sir Nick Scheele chief operating officer to come up with a series of measures to show whether Ford was achieving its restructuring objectives When they are presented at July's meeting these tests are expected to include a number of non-financial items such as management retention levels buying patterns among Ford customers quality levels and employee surveys Such measures will be presented and compared at every board meeting going forwards along with detailed breakdowns of the group's on-going trading results Those figures will be co-ordinated by Carl Reichardt executive vice-chairman and Allan Gilmour the former Ford vice-chairman who came out of retirement last month to become the group's new chief financial officer They are expected to tell the board that the company could out-perform its financial targets for this year exceeding the break-even forecast made by Mr Ford when he unveiled the group restructuring in January Mr Reichardt former chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo and Mr Gilmour are also expected to unveil proposals for tighter financial controls and discipline over Ford's capital expenditure purchasing and product development That effort according to one official will amount to blocking and tackling the financing functions more detailed forecasting and a withdrawal from non-automotive financing at the Ford Credit division We had 10 years of drift in the financial management at Ford but Bill regards Reichardt and Gilmour as two world class operators to address the problems according to one Dearborn insider Nevertheless it could be several months before the first tangible results of that renewed financial discipline begin to emerge Even then it could be undermined by aggressive price discounting by aresurgent General Motors on-going restructuring costs and unhelpful currency issues Whatever the outcome the evolutionary changes under way in Ford's boardroom suggest that Henry Ford's great-grandson intends to mark the group's centenary with a more open and transparent management style ,2
2002-06-27, The administrator of SAirGroup the bankrupt Swiss aviation group is stepping up pressure on PwC and KPMG SAirGroup's auditors to release their audit records of the group which collapsed late last year owing up to SFr38bn $25bn Karl Wuthrich SAirGroup's court-appointed administrator told a creditors' meeting in Zurich yesterday that the two accountancy groups had not yet felt able to grant the administrator access to their audit records which he needs as part of his investigation into last year's unexpected bankruptcy of Swissair The collapse of SAirGroup Swissair's parent was the most dramatic of a series of corporate upheavals in Switzerland which highlighted weak corporate governance lack of financial transparency and questionable accounting practices in several Swiss blue-chip groups Mr Wuthrich has been investigating a series of issues surrounding SAirGroup's accounting including its practice of not fully consolidating its holdings in heavily indebted foreign airlines and boosting its balance-sheet ratios and liquidity with a series of little-known equity swaps with banks PwC SAirGroup's long-time auditors had been replaced last year by KPMG after Mario Corti a former Nestle finance director was brought in to try and rescue SAirGroup parent of Swissair KPMG had carried out a thorough review of SAirGroup which led to a reduction in SAirGroup's end-2000 equity from SFr1 2bn to SFr716m a 30 per cent increase in the group's debt to SFr12 9bn and a SFr2 6bn increase in the total end-2000 balance sheet to SFr22 9bn The administrator has now instructed Ernst & Young a rival accounting firm to undertake an investigation into the responsibility borne by the governing and executive bodies of SAirGroup for its subsequent spectacular collapse Zurich prosecutors have already launched a criminal investigation into three former Swissair executives and have searched the houses and offices of several SAirGroup board members SAirGroup directors have argued that the group's complex accounting practices were fully agreed with its auditors ,2
2002-06-26, Germany's Ifo business climate index slipped back this month as labour market unrest and growing global uncertainty eroded confidence in the eurozone's biggest economy The figures put a brake on the euro which has risen to a two-year high against the dollar But German ministers played down the Ifo decline insisting the country's fragile recovery remained on track The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index based on a survey of more than 7000 companies fell to 91 3 in June from a revised 91 6 in May The decline was due almost entirely to a sharp deterioration in the expectations component of the index which fell from 106 2 to 104 9 Economists said the decline reflected growing concern about stock market weakness and the global economic outlook The survey's assessment of current business conditions improved from 77 7 in May to 78 3 although it still remains well below the levels of last year Gernot Nerb Ifo economist said the slight drop in the index was temporary and insisted it would resume its upward trend Germany's economic recovery had found a solid footing in the second quarter he said But economists said the dip in sentiment underlined the vulnerability of Germany's upturn and increased doubts about the strength of the eurozone recovery The uncertainty also increased the likelihood that the European Central Bank which meets next week would wait before raising rates on hold at 3 25 per cent since November The Ifo drop follows indications from Belgium and the Netherlands that business confidence in the eurozone has declined This may be a sign of a greater realism creeping into judgments about the business outlook   as the US slows in the second quarter said Nigel Anderson of RBS Financial Markets Analysts said there were also signs that the stronger euro was already beginning to dent export prospects the main driver of Germany's economic recovery There is a danger a further strengthening of the euro might put an end to the recovery before it has got started said Rainer Gunterman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein But Werner Muller economics minister said he was not concerned about the recent rise of the euro Only a fifth of German exports are invoiced in dollars he said Mr Muller insisted the economic upswing was gaining momentum forecasting German gross domestic product growth of more than 1 per cent this year against an official government forecast of 0 75 per cent  Professor Horst Siebert one of five wise men who advise Berlin said yesterday that the recent euro gains would not hit German exports and that the European Central Bank could keep rates on hold for now Reuters reports from Kiel A 10 per cent nominal appreciation I would not expect that to have a big impact on exports said Prof Siebert German exports are much more driven by growth developments in the world and what happens in the United States than by the foreign exchange rates ,2

2002-06-08, Tate & Lyle Tate & Lyle's shares bounced back yesterday on signs that the restructuring begun two years ago is beginning to deliver results A pre-tax profit of £159m compared with the previous year's post exceptionals loss of £190m represents a considerable turnround Net debt has fallen from 91 to 59 per cent of assets The problem businesses most notably Domino in the US have been sold and the shift to higher value carbohydrate ingredients is beginning to pay off From strength comes forth sweetness But the company still has a long way to go before it removes the bitter taste from the ill-considered expansion of the 1990s Investors recall the 1996 profit peak of £327m This year Tate & Lyle will not have to bear Domino's losses of more than £20m though £7m of central costs will have to be allocated elsewhere while the integration of Amylum should deliver a net saving of £10m The proposed sale of United Molasses could produce an exceptional profit of around £20m In the market place Cargill's acquisition of Cerestar should improve pricing discipline on both sides of the Atlantic A pre-tax profit of £200m this time will produce earnings per share of just over 28p The shares are supported by a dividend yield of 5 1 per cent while an enterprise value of 6 3 times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation is at the lower end of the food processing sector Tate & Lyle must show the recovery is sustainable to remove that discount ,2
2002-04-18, The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday raided Clubhaus the golf and country clubs operator that is attempting to restructure its L105m debt in a bid to avoid insolvency In a late announcement the Kent-based company yesterday said the DTI had notified it on Tuesday that two officers had been appointed to investigate the company under section 447 of the Companies Act 1985 This gives the DTI wide ranging powers to require a company to produce its records including searching the premises and seizing papers Clubhaus confirmed that DTI officials had been on its premises yesterday But Charlie Parker chief executive said he was unable to elaborate The DTI which does not normally comment on investigations said it was highly irregular for a company to put out a statement Mr Parker said that in light of the restructuring it was in Clubhaus's interest to keep everyone fully informed The restructuring which envisages bondholders gaining 80 per cent of the company's equity follows a controversial L75m asset revaluation in November that caused net liabilities to exceed shareholders' funds Eddy Shah a disgruntled shareholder is thought to have written to the DTI over his concerns of possible accounting irregularities and the role of auditors Deloitte & Touche at Clubhaus ,2
2002-06-19, Hamid Karzai Afghanistan's interim president yesterday asked the loya jirga to keep working an additional day in order to present his cabinet choices Mr Karzai's step yesterday gained him some much needed credibility in the eyes of jirga delegates many of whom have been accusing the interim administration of trying to exploit the time limit on the jirga to avoid discussing the cabinet the most sensitive issue of the Afghan peace process The jirga was originally expected to finish on Sunday Having made little progress since Mr Karzai's re-election last Thursday it has been under pressure to disband Mr Karzai said the delay in announcing the cabinet was due to the many hours he has spent negotiating with various groups over the past few days Fortunately we have many professionals in this country but few cabinet posts I should either increase the size of the cabinet or cut down on the number of professionals joked Mr Karzai to hoots of approving laughter in the jirga yesterday He said he would announce his cabinet to the jirga at 5pm Kabul time today Zalmay Khalilzad US special envoy to Kabul also was quoted as saying yesterday that jirga approval of at least the key posts in government was needed according to last December's Bonn peace accords Whoever said the approval of the loya jirga is not needed has spoken mistakenly On that we are perfectly clear  It was not clear however how the jirga would express its approval and whether this meant a formal vote Many Afghan groups would like to see greater ethnic and political balance in the cabinet which has been dominated since December by the ethnic Tajik-led Northern Alliance They have control of the most powerful ministries defence interior and foreign affairs ,3
2002-04-12, Drugs companies being investigated in connection with the biggest suspected fraud on the National Health Service could eventually face civil action from government authorities in an attempt to recover sums unofficially estimated at up to £400m On Wednesday business premises and homes across England Scotland and Wales were raided by police and Serious Fraud Office officers investigating an alleged fraud involving overcharging and possible price-fixing collusion in the supply of antibiotics and warfarin widely used drugs during the four years to December 2000 The companies are thought to have been looked at first about two years ago by the Department of Health's Counter-Fraud Service CFS with support from private investigators This followed sharp rises in the price of 190 generic drugs Additional alleged information about collusion between some of the companies is thought to have been provided to investigators by a whistleblower in at least one of the companies The case was referred to the Serious Fraud Office by the CFS with strong support from Alan Milburn the health secretary some six months ago when the potential scale of the fraud began to be seen There was a sense that this was not just another smaller fraud of the kind that the CFS had been dealing with till then It was big stuff said a person familiar with the investigation In one of the biggest operations mounted by the SFO investigators executed search warrants on several business and private premises on Wednesday morning using the element of surprise to avoid the feared destruction of possible evidence The six suppliers being investigated are Generics UK Kent Pharmaceuticals Regent GM Laboratories Goldhield Group Norton Healthcare and Ranbaxy UK Action to stem the suspected fraud was pushed at the highest levels of government as part of a government attack on anti-competitive behaviour and on waste and poor accountability within the NHS one investigator suggested Downing Street was informed shortly before Wednesday's raids Goldhield said late last night it would seek a relisting of its shares today It said it had never sold any penicillin-based antibiotics Sales to the NHS of warfarin-based drugs during the period under investigation totalled £6 9m Shares in Goldhield the only quoted company under investigation were suspended at the company's request on Wednesday after falling 36 per cent to 342 5p ,2
2002-04-13, Liquidity is fuel for stock markets and UK shareholders are set to receive a large injection of it in the second quarter After bruising falls in the UK telecommunications sector this week the market needs all the help it can get A case can be made that part of this tide of available cash will be put to work in equities but it is tougher to argue that the telecommunications sector will see much of it Where is the money coming from Fund managers' cash balances are near to benchmark levels but the market's liquidity dynamics are about to change There is a marked seasonal pattern to dividend payments with 35 per cent of UK dividends paid in April and May Credit Suisse First Boston estimates that in 2002 this amounts to more than £7bn in April and £9bn in May Share buy-backs worth £2 9bn have also been completed so far this year a further addition to market liquidity Merger and acquisition activity is a further positive factor for shareholder cash flows and while well below peak levels it is recovering CSFB calculates that M&A proceeds will total £16bn in the first half of this year Share issues reduce available liquidity and ICI and HBOS have tapped the market for £800m and £1 1bn respectively this year But the net effect is positive We estimate a net return of £41bn to UK shareholders in the first-half of this year 2 8 per cent of the FTSE-All Share market capitalisation says Kevin Gardiner of CSFB This is before considering bond flows Semi-annual bond coupon payments are centred on June while sterling bond redemptions for June total £25bn But will this fresh liquidity flow into the equity market The prospect of lower future equity returns has renewed the asset allocation debate on the relative attractiveness of bonds versus equities With the technology bubble and its subsequent spectacular collapse still fresh in the memory it is tough to believe the world is a less volatile place But Legal & General Investment Management points out that from a macroeconomic viewpoint there has been a marked decline in the volatility of both real growth rates and inflation since 1970 The level of inflation is also much lower reflecting the success of inflation-targeting policy by independent central banks An assumption of lower nominal equity returns in a less volatile low-inflation world appears reasonable The expected return on UK equities in the future should average around 8 per cent per annum says Andrew Clare of Legal & General Investment Management However there is a distinct difference between arguing that the 13 per cent average real returns from equities seen in the 1980s and 1990s will not be repeated and arguing that bonds offer a better investment While low by the standards of the last two decades this expected 8 per cent return is still 2 25 percentage points a year more than Legal & General expects to earn from gilts Not a great outperformance in any one year but the impact of compounding on returns over a longer investment horizon is significant It is more difficult to build a case that technology and telecommunications stocks will be the recipients of fresh cash The next couple of weeks will provide clarification on whether the improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals is starting to feed through into increased corporate profitability Investors will have to digest US first-quarter earnings results from Nokia and key performance indicators from Vodafone The omens are not good IBM'sprofit warning this week has set nerves jangling since it operates in every sector of the computing market from semiconductors to computer services Cisco the networking group fell 8 per cent on Tuesday as nervous investors sold stock on rumours of an imminent profit warning Vodafone has seen its shares drop more than 15 per cent this week after analysts questioned the company's growth prospects The difficulties have been compounded by speculation that it is set to write off large chunks of the goodwill on its books after its acquisition programme Goodwill write-downs do not affect a cashflow analysis of the company but there is an impact on sentiment Vodafone might as well run up a banner proclaiming We paid way too much for these assets With technology and telecommunications stocks still rated for growth and scant signs of earnings recovery optimistic sentiment has been left as the main support for valuations We have yet to see the corporate numbers but it is clear that the market is afraid performance will fall short of expectations yet again particularly in the telecommunications arena Events this week show how quickly positive sentiment can evaporate You buy stocks that you expect will be upgraded not ones that you anticipate may be downgraded CSFB which analyses corporate earnings momentum sees potential in cyclical services such as transport entertainment and leisure and advertising At the end of last year the sector was heavily out of favour four out of five earnings revisions in cyclical services were downgrades As the economic upswing has gathered pace the revisions are more evenly balanced between upgrades and downgrades If you are looking for earnings growth be careful which so-called growth stocks you buy ,2

2002-06-03, Not so slick Opec is hardly the most transparent organisation even on regular cartel business And when it comes to selecting a successor to Ali Rodriguez recalled to Venezuela to run the oil ministry as head of its secretariat in Vienna matters become positively murky But while there is no odds-on candidate for the job likely to be filled at the June 26 Opec oil ministers' meeting in Vienna the word is that Saudi Arabia will again put forward its Opec governor Suleiman Jasir al-Herbish and that this time he will win Winning means securing unanimous approval not always easy among ex-belligerents Indeed three warring Opec members managed to cancel each other out in 2000 Then when the Saudis put up al-Herbish Iran countered with its Opec governor and Iraq volunteered its United Nations' ambassador The only person they could eventually agree on was Rodriguez After two non-Middle Easterners Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria currently Opec's president was Rodriguez's predecessor as secretary-general it is probably time for a Gulf candidate The main case against selecting a Saudi is that it would underline the dominance of Saudi Arabia Opec's biggest producer This is partly why the Saudis have not had the secretary generalship since 1967 But maybe they have tired of being the power behind the throne or in their case the throne behind the power ,3

2002-06-10, HSBC the UK bank is preparing to establish a new hedge fund business within its fund management division in a bid to become a global force in alternative investments HSBC Alternative Investments currently awaiting regulatory approval by the Financial Services Authority is to spearhead the bank's attack into the lucrative hedge fund market Alain Dromer chief executive of HSBC Asset Management said the move was part of the bank's plan to turn round its underachieving fund management operation Its stated ambition is to triple funds under management over the next five years from $138bn to $400bn £274bn Mr Dromer said HSBCs strategic plan for fund management includes expansion in China and India where it is close to getting regulatory approval as an onshore fund manager and the US The bank may also wrap the fund management business of its German subsidiary HSBC Trinkhaus & Burkhardt into HSBC Asset Management which is headquartered in London Overnight this would lift funds under management by $25bn or 18 per cent HSBC currently runs three hedge funds with a total of $500m of funds under management Mr Dromer said We have ambitious plans to develop this We think that if we can offer a hedge fund with the HSBC brand that is an attractive proposition  Some investment houses run hedge funds as a way of retaining their top fund managers who are encouraged to stay because of the prospect of taking a chunk of the profitable hedge fund business But this is not HSBCs rationale because it plans to offer a diversified range of hedge funds including market neutral global macro event-driven and merger arbitrage and will therefore need to hire staff from other institutions We will recruit teams of people and most of these teams will come from outside Mr Dromer said suggesting a hiring spree But he added that from time to time these teams may come from inside as well He said it was not too late to make a concerted effort to enter the hedge fund market There will be a lot of Darwinian selection because not everything in the hedge fund industry is of superb quality We will have a place consistent with our brand and profile ,1
2002-06-10, Italian capital The trouble with Italian capitalism is that it doesn't have enough capital Fiat's financial difficulties are only the latest example of an Italian company driven to extremes by its shortage of cash Telecom Italia remains a running example of the conflicts that arise when a reference shareholder wants to exert control without paying for it The acquisition of the Fondiaria insurance company by the family- controlled SAI group is another case where cash constraints have forced the group into financial contortions So why does a system which so badly needs to attract capital go to such lengths to abuse the investors who could provide that capital The standard method of exploiting minority shareholders in a merger is to undervalue their shares That has happened with SAI/Fondiaria adjusting for a warrant Fondiaria shareholders are being offered the equivalent of one SAI share for every 3 66 Fondiaria against a market average of less than 13 over the last year In the case of Italenergia's merger with Edison however the abuse is more ingeniously achieved by overvaluing the target's shares Italenergia a consortium set up by Fiat EdF and some financial partners owns 92 per cent of the ordinary shares of Edison and has debt of {XEU}5 6bn The more its Edison shares are worth the more Italenergia net of debt is worth and so the more favourable to the consortium partners the merger ratio At the market price of {XEU}2 40 per Edison share prevailing before the merger plans were announced Italenergia would have ended up with 56 per cent of the ordinary shares of the combined company But at the {XEU}3 58 per share valuation dreamed up for the purpose of the merger it winds up with 82 per cent of the ordinaries To add insult to injury the merged company then proposes to reduce its gearing by selling up to {XEU}1bn of new equity presumably to the same minority Edison investors it has just fleeced Despite the Draghi reforms of 1998 insider control often through the elaborate pyramid structures typified by Telecom Italia remains widespread On average the five largest shareholders of the bigger companies control 87 per cent of the shares according to the OECD and more than half of all listed companies are controlled by a single owner The government and Bank of Italy set a poor example with their protectionism As for Consob the stock market regulator's spirit may be willing but its flesh is weak All this has deterred outside investors from supplying the equity capital Italy so needs It will continue to do so for as long as minority shareholders can be abused with impunity ,2
2002-06-22, Dollar weakness pushed the euro above $0 97 to a 26-month high and helped the yen to a seven-month high on Friday after comments by Japan appeared to lessen the likelihood of intervention to weaken the yen The euro reached a high of $0 9722 against the dollar more than an 8 per cent gain on the year and a rise of more than 12 per cent from the euro's $0 8582 low late in January But it was a story of dollar weakness rather than euro strength The euro is playing catch-up with the yen's gains against the dollar here said Paul Bednarczyk currency strategist at 4Cast the economic consultancy Otherwise it's the same old story Wall Street looked higher but turned shaky again  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 5 per cent weaker by the middle of New York trading and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1 2 per cent Analysts warned triple witching the expiration of stock index options and futures could make equity trading more volatile than usual prompting dollar selling by jittery investors The market is focusing on the weakness in the US stock market and they are going to push it to the limit said Will Rugg currency analyst at Standard & Poor's Gains for the yen prompted the dollar's move lower after Masajuro Shiokawa Japan's finance minister said it was natural for exchange rates to move up and down and if the authorities worried too much over such moves they would lose sight of the overall economic picture The dollar fell as far as Y120 83 against the yen The comments were considerably less interventionist than recent remarks by finance ministry officials who have warned almost daily that Japan continued to monitor the market very closely and would take appropriate action if moves were too severe The Bank of Japan intervened four times last month to stem the yen's climb Shiokawa's comments gave the market the impression the authorities have thrown in the towel on intervention for the moment said Kamal Sharma currencies strategist at Commerzbank It looks as if they recognise this move is based on dollar weakness rather than yen strength  Ever wary traders suggested the BoJ could be attempting to lull the market into a false sense of security encouraging investors to build up short dollar positions in the hope that eventual intervention would have a greater impact US weakness overnight helped sterling to break above $1 50 against the dollar for the first time since January 2001 reaching a high of $1 5017 in early European trade ,2
2002-04-19, Sales of diesel cars have accelerated far beyond government and industry expectations because of new tax rules aimed at promoting the use of greener cars More than half of all new orders being placed for company cars are for diesels according to some of the biggest fleet specialists Extra incentives announced by Gordon Brown on Wednesday in addition to existing company car tax and vehicle excise duty rules are certain to hasten the trend industry analysts said yesterday Well over 500000 new diesel cars are expected to take to Britain's roads this year Diesels are about 25 per cent more economical than their petrol-powered equivalents as well as emitting 25 per cent less carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas associated with global warming The upsurge has resulted in a 50 per cent jump in diesel sales to company and private motorists over the past 12 months overshadowing a more widely-expected downsizing by motorists to smaller more economical petrol cars In the company car sector fleet and leasing specialists say the surge in diesel sales began in September when company car drivers started to become aware of the implications of the new company car tax regime which was announced last year but only became effective this month It imposes additional income tax penalties of up to £3000 a year on high-mileage executives driving large-capacity petrol cars with high carbon dioxide emissions The main carrot for private buyers has been last year's introduction of vehicle excise duty bands based on a car's emissions of carbon dioxide These reduced duty payable on the lowest carbon dioxide-emitters to £100 little more than half that payable by high emitters In Wednesday's Budget Mr Brown announced a lower duty of £60 for the cleanest small cars many of which are also powered by diesel and reduced duty on alternative environmentally friendly fuels such as low-sulphur biodiesel Citroen's diesel sales rose by 101 per cent last year and by a further 57 per cent in this year's first quarter Its C3 small hatchback which is about to be launched has an official overall fuel consumption of 67 miles per gallon and is expected to maintain the expansion However the government has lingering doubts about the health aspects of hydrocarbon particulates emitted by diesels ,2
1998-04-04, Argos GUS's bid for Argos has not developed into the rout that initially seemed likely Whereas it once appeared possible that GUS might escape without raising its 570p per share offer that option is no longer tenable So much is clear from the share price which closed yesterday at 655p The new profit forecast and revised retail strategy show that Argos's core business is not the dud concept some believe The Littlewoods tie-up meanwhile has reminded the market that GUS is not the only entry point to home-shopping The £431m return of capital is simply an added sweetener So what is Argos worth to GUS Assume 35{1/2}p earnings this year attach a multiple similar to Dixons add in a dividend and the share ex-bid is probably worth around 570p To that must be added the potential value of the home-shopping business and a control premium Perhaps Lord Wolfson GUS's chairman could get away offering less than the market price say 630p But is it worth the risk of being too cute After all Argos is of considerable strategic value to GUS it provides the means for transforming GUS's declining home-shopping business into a viable direct mail-order offer That is a price worth paying up for especially if the alternative strengthens its main competitor Littlewoods Lord Wolfson will not want to overpay but nor is this a time for false economies ,2

2002-06-19, The Financial Services Authority confirmed yesterday it was monitoring the life assurance sector following recent falls in the stock market The City watchdog has been watching the life assurers' solvency levels In an interview yesterday with BBC News 24 Sir Howard Davies FSA chairman was asked how loudly the alarm bells were ringing for the sector I can hear them he said This is the first time Sir Howard has publicly acknowledged his concerns following the recent sharp fall in equity markets where insurers hold billions of pounds of investments Sir Howard this year warned it was important for the long-term health of the insurance industry and clients that its capital base was strengthened The FSA last year twice relaxed its resilience test following concerns that insurers would be heavy sellers of shares in order to bolster their financial position Following the September 11 attacks on the US and the resulting fall in global markets the FSA said several UK life assurers were trading close to their regulatory solvency margin However the regulator emphasised these margins were set very high and therefore did not mean any companies were close to commercial insolvency Sir Howard also expressed concern about risky home loans some people were taking out ,2
2002-06-21, From Dr Simon J Evenett Sir Guy de Jonquie`res and Frances Williams paint an overly pessimistic picture of the state of negotiations in Geneva Stalled in Geneva June 19 For some time even successful multilateral trade negotiations have been near death experiences with brinkmanship and last-minute deals keeping everyone on tenterhooks Given this regrettable record and with many nations' capitals providing few signals to their negotiators in Geneva it is no wonder that the latter have been preserving their options What is disappointing is the widespread unwillingness in Geneva to go beyond making sweeping claims about market access and the so-called Singapore issues It would be much more useful to know what permutations of specific proposals stand a good chance of enhancing the economic performance of World Trade Organisation members For example it is highly unlikely that the effect of liberalising each protected agricultural good is the same Can we identify those where reforms in the Group of Seven nations would enhance developing economies' market access and at the same time have less impact on farming employment Furthermore how much of the trade and environment agenda can be accomplished by reducing barriers to environmentally related goods and services Last can we identify a potential mix of disciplines on incentives to foreign investors that induces WTO members to step back from their ruinous competition to lure multinational corporations the principal consequence of which is to transfer funds from overstretched national treasuries to the shareholders of these companies This last question is all the more telling given the growing body of economic research that shows that the knock-on benefits from such investments tends to be very small Exploratory discussions along these lines are more likely to result in a successful outcome at the Cancun ministerial than the current shouting matches Simon J Evenett Director of Economic Research World Trade Institute 3012 Bern Switzerland,3
2002-04-23, The blank look on the face of Jacques Chirac on Sunday night said it all He was as surprised and shocked as everyone else when he learned he would face Jean-Marie Le Pen leader of the extreme right National Front in the run-off election for president on May 5 Mr Chirac and his advisers had counted on a straight right-left contest against Lionel Jospin the outgoing Socialist premier Mr Chirac seems almost certain to come out on top in the choice between his moderate right platform and the nationalist rhetoric of the 73- year-old former paratrooper To stop a man branded a fascist becoming head of state in continental Europe's second largest democracy the Socialists at least are likely to vote for Mr Chirac Initial polls suggest Mr Chirac could obtain well over 75 per cent of the votes But the prospect of such a big victory assuring a second term in office for the incumbent president is deceptive The 69-year-old Mr Chirac will win for lack of a better choice and to prevent what is seen as an affront to France it will be a vote against Mr Le Pen and for many out of respect for the institution of France's head of state the pinnacle of the country's political system Mr Chirac's score on Sunday was 19 9 per cent of the votes cast the weakest performance by an incumbent president seeking re-election during the Fifth Republic If measured against the 40m registered voters and the relatively low turnout he was backed by just under 14 per cent of the total electorate His main aim during the second round campaign will be to stand above the fray playing the role of benign statesman and appealing across the ideological divide But Mr Le Pen will do his best to bring him off his perch The two men detest each other and Mr Le Pen relishes the prospect of throwing all the muck he can at Mr Chirac This means that the issue of corruption at Paris city hall while Mr Chirac was mayor will be dragged up So too will the president's denials of having tried to forge deals with the National Front in the past Thus Mr Chirac could be re-elected without the necessary moral authority and personal credibility The only way Mr Chirac can reassert himself will be via the triumph of his rightwing allies in the June parliamentary elections The electorate would then be seen to have endorsed a strong mandate for him to control both the executive and legislature To win the general election will require a big show of unity among the mainstream parties of the right principally Mr Chirac's own Gaullist RPR the centrist UDF and the Liberals These parties have been shaped round individuals rather than policies and remain jealously guarded fiefdoms Efforts to bring these parties together to back Mr Chirac's presidential re-election foundered because too many thought it dangerous to tie their fate to a party of the president But with the Chirac re-election now almost out of the way the need to present a unified front to fight a difficult parliamentary general election could just be the catalyst However the moderate right will have to work hard to redefine itself It is still caught between old-fashioned Gaullist nationalism and the search for a platform that balances tax cuts and greater private initiative alongside a strong public sector Equally the election result on Sunday was a serious defeat for the moderate left headed by Mr Jospin and the Socialists now must rethink their identity It remains the sole party with a large-scale countrywide organisation Under Mr Jospin's premiership the party steered a pragmatic course accepting France's biggest recent privatisation programme alongside interventionist measures such as the 35-hour week Yet Mr Jospin like the bulk of the party was inspired by ideas rooted in an essentially Marxist view of society This led to an uncomfortable accommodation with the market-orientated policies imposed by Brussels and the eurozone stability pact Whenever in doubt Mr Jospin tilted to the left to ensure the support of the Communists But with the collapse of the Communist vote on Sunday as loyalties shifted further to the left among some 10 per cent of the electorate the Socialists have to decide whether their future lies in being a party of the centre-left in the social democrat mould or one aligned further to the left and against the European mainstream The abstentions and protest votes a sizeable portion of Mr Le Pen's score suggest the mainstream politicians have lost contact with the electorate The surprise outcome was a cry of alarm from an electorate looking for direction and latching on to the most seductive siren songs or simply punishing those in power But without an overhaul and some new political blood the parties themselves will become more fragile and their coalitions more brittle in government A strong presidency can knock heads together provided the head of state controls the national assembly But should a revenge vote bring the left back to power in the June general elections another co-habitation can only mean weak government with contested legitimacy between presidency and parliament ,3
1998-04-01, From Mr Bryan Cassidy MEP Sir Reflecting on last week's European Commission and European Monetary Institute reports on which countries qualify for monetary union your editorial The limits of thrift and the excellent analysis by Peter Martin Europe boldly goes March 28-29 quite rightly stress the demographic timebomb ticking away in those countries such as France and Germany with heavy burdens of unfunded pay as you go pensions The European Commission conspicuously omitted to mention it The EMI country analyses discreetly draw attention to it however Indeed they single out for praise the countries which already have or are moving towards a high level of private pension provision the UK Finland Ireland and the Netherlands But there are two other pension problems likely to aggravate the situation especially in Germany One is the excessively long period of 10 years before an employee's pension is vested a great inhibitor to job mobility The other is the practice of German companies using their employees' pension funds to bolster their balance sheets -a practice that gives an entirely false impression of the soundness of many German companies as well as being unfair to their workers Neither of these problems is referred to either in the European Commission document on monetary union or surprisingly in that of the EMI ,3

2002-06-27, Americans struggling with layoffs and shrinking company retirement plans may soon have to face another nasty consequence of the economic downturn rising income taxes States around the country are fighting huge budget shortfalls As salaries have been cut and layoffs have mounted tax revenues a key source of state income have dropped sharply Virtually every state has seen a significant drop in their revenues says Scott Pattison executive director of the National Association of State Budget Offices Nasbo Since fiscal 2002 budgets were enacted last year at least 40 states have had to come to terms with budget shortfalls of nearly $40bn Mr Pattison said Especially large falls have occurred in revenue from corporate taxes because of lower corporate profits In California for example the surge in the Nasdaq index and the soaring values of the state's high-tech companies in 1999 and 2000 created an unprecedented surge in state tax revenues from capital gains and stock option income In 2000 California received more than $200bn in income related to capital gains and stock options up from $25bn in 1994 But as the stock market fell in 2001 and as the US economy's slump was worsened by the terrorist attacks on September 11 the state suffered its most precipitous decline in revenue since the second world war US states with the exception of Vermont are required to balance their budgets To meet their shortfalls they have come up with a variety of measures to raise money including raising taxes on cigarettes and motor vehicles Michigan which is facing a $1bn budget deficit has ordered a hiring freeze and across-the-board spending cuts and is also expected to draw on its budget reserve funds to balance its operations A Senate bill has also been introduced asking for billions for states in emergency relief State governors a number of whom are up for re-election this year have mostly shied away from taking the politically dangerous step of raising personal income taxes However this option is being broached with Oregon proposing a temporary income tax rate increase and Tennessee considering implementing income taxes for the first time Advocacy group and credit analysts say that a rise in income taxes is likely with the measures taken by states thus far providing only a temporary fix to longer-term problems Jean Ross executive director of research and advocacy at the California Budget Group says the magnitude of the state's current gap coupled with the reliance on one-time measures to bridge the gap is likely to result in substantial deficits of $7bn-$10bn in future years California's reliance on revenues from tobacco bonds and spending cuts to address its $23 6bn deficit postpones the date by which the state attains long-term budget stability says Moody's Investors Service which downgraded the state's credit rating in November The credit quality of several other states is expected to continue weakening especially if the US stock market fails to rebound and the economy remains weak States enduring both substantial revenue shortfalls and expenditure excesses include Illinois Arizona Massachusetts Michigan and New Jersey There is also a lag between the recovery of the economy and healthier state budgets of 12 to 18 months says Nasbo The next two fiscal years are expected to be especially difficult said Mr Pattison He added that only in 2005 could states expect some relief ,2

1998-04-03, Australia's deputy prime minister and trade minister Tim Fischer yesterday vowed to pursue the elimination of farm subsidies and agriculture trade tariffs in Europe and Japan although he admitted he faced solid resistance from the two regions Mr Fischer who was addressing farming representative and ministers from the 15-member Cairns Group of agriculture exporters in Sydney said the group was preparing robust arguments for the end of protectionism We want to see an end to the sort of subsidies where no matter how many thousands of litres of olive oil are being produced the EU is saying to farmers 'You are allowed to produce as many hectares as you want' he said Pointing to his own government's abolition of sugar imports tariffs since the last meeting of World Trade Organisation ministers in Singapore he said Europe would eventually have to go the same way  His comments follow this week's EU agreement to call for a millennium round of global trade negotiations at next month's WTO ministerial meeting in Geneva The Cairns bloc formed to lobby against farm subsidies export credits and trade barriers is pushing for reforms in agriculture in line with advances in other areas of trade The EU has historically argued for exemptions in primary industries Dean Kleckner head of the American Farm Bureau Federation and a guest speaker told delegates he expected to see significant reforms in global agricultural trade within five to 10 years The Cairns Group named after the venue of its first meeting in 1986 includes Argentina Australia Brazil Canada Chile Colombia Fiji Indonesia Malaysia New Zealand Paraguay Philippines South Africa Thailand and Uruguay It represents 550m people and around 20 per cent of global agricultural exports ,3

2002-04-08, Gordon Brown must avoid increasing the growth rate of spending on public services and cut taxes on business by £2bn the Confederation of British Industry says In its annual Budget submission today the CBI calls for absolutely no further ratcheting up of total spending to avoid the need for any further tax increases It accepts that the chancellor is likely to announce further public spending increases on health education transport and crime But it concludes This possibility is of great concern to business  Revealing worries that the Mr Brown will seek to disguise tax increases by targeting the corporate sector Digby Jones the CBI's director-general said business should not be seen as a soft touch He added It is wrong to see raising business taxes as a less painful alternative to politically unpopular individual tax increases  Mr Jones linked recent falls in corporate profitability to past tax increases on business income The CBI estimates that these have cumulatively cost companies £29bn since 1997 The increasing tax burden is eating into the ability of firms to fund expansion create wealth and sustain more and better-paid jobs Mr Jones said The employers' organisation has welcomed the early announcement of two Budget measures last month Tax exemptions for the disposal of substantial shareholdings and tax relief for the costs of intangible assets are worth £500m a year for big business Mr Brown also confirmed he would introduce a research and development tax credit but details of its generosity were kept under wraps This tax credit has long been desired by large UK companies The CBI says that noticeable results would not be achieved cheaply a revenue cost of around £1bn would seem to be required On top of £2bn tax cuts in next week's Budget the CBI is pressing the chancellor for similarly large tax cuts in the following four Budgets Specific requests are for a tax credit to help smaller companies train employees an extension of discounts on the climate change levy lower stamp duty on business property transactions a reduction in excise duties on alcohol and lower value added tax on tourist accommodation The list of taxation suggestions would greatly exceed the CBI's suggestion that tax cuts in this Budget should total £2bn Yesterday the CBI said its immediate priorities were a generous research and development tax credit a training tax credit and lower vat for hotels bed and breakfasts and campsites Digby Jones's view Page 23 www ft com/budget2002,3

2002-06-21, Levi Strauss the struggling jeans maker insisted yesterday it was at an inflection point in its turnround despite falling sales and heavy second-quarter losses after restructuring charges The San Francisco-based company one of the world's biggest clothing manufacturers reported a net loss of $80 9m after one-off charges of $171m relating mainly to eight factory closures in the US and Scotland Before the charges second-quarter net income fell 65 per cent from $43m to $15m Net sales fell 12 per cent from $1 04bn to $924m or 11 per cent at constant exchange rates continuing the decline that began in the late 1990s The privately-owned Levi under chief executive Phil Marineau has been trying to reverse market share losses after consumers started deserting its jeans and opting for fresher youth brands It has cut costs and reduced its manufacturing base overhauled its product range and adopted a more segmented marketing approach adding high-fashion hand-crafted jeans and its redesigned Engineered products It is launching a low-price entry-level jeans range at {XEU}45 $42 a pair in Europe where it says it is facing tough price competition Levi is pinning its hopes on the revamped product range to be rolled out through the second half of this year and next spring to stabilise its sales by the year-end Excitement from the retailers is very strong That is the first part of the equation said Bill Chiasson chief financial officer But consumers still have to vote with their wallets  He said Levi still expected full-year earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation to be 11-13 per cent of sales and its gross margin to be 40-42 per cent within their previously stated target ranges ,2
2002-06-08, With the Queen's Golden Jubilee the thoughts of this online trader have turned to gold Well it is not just the Jubilee but also the five-year high in gold prices and the potential war in the Indian sub-continent Deciding whether to be exposed to gold prices is not the most important step After all pundits have been advocating exposure for years Rather it is deciding how whether to buy the metal a fund futures spread betting or mining stocks On this and how to use the web for it the pundits are quiet It has been eight years since I traded gold futures back when I was a Congressional intern Of course in 1994 the same time I stumbled across the web I should have been buying Amazon and AOL stock not trading gold Buying gold should have less to do with whether you think the price will rise and more to do with the benefits of diversification for your portfolio During major stock market recessions by holding gold you would have outperformed pure share investors For instance in the periods 1929-1934 1968-1974 2000-2002 the S&P 500 fell around 63 per cent 34 per cent and 26 per cent respectively However the price of gold rose 69 per cent 347 per cent and 9 per cent in turn Even if you bought leading companies Coca-Cola and Disney in 1972 you would not have shown a positive return until 1985 whereas gold spot prices went from $44 to $341 per troy ounce over the same period So far this year the US precious metals sector is up 63 per cent the Dow is flat The value of gold is not its unique properties or its glimmer in jewellery but that it is negatively correlated that is it does not move in tandem with most other asset classes The economic forces that determine the price of gold often push in the opposite direction to the factors driving the price of other asset classes When long-term bonds decline there is a tendency for gold to go up When equities fall there is an even greater tendency for the gold price to rise Indeed gold is more negatively correlated to stocks than any other asset class typically used as portfolio diversifiers such as foreign stocks real estate bonds small-cap stocks and emerging market stocks With most asset classes studies show higher correlations when markets decline the so-called 'contagion-effect' where markets fall in tandem implying that the benefit of the safety net of diversification is lost when it is needed most Not so with gold it retains its diversification benefits even under volatile falling markets Moreover if the dollar devalues the price of gold in terms of dollars should rise As such it represents a hedge against the dollar and offers protection if like me you hold dollar denominated investments The message appears to be buy gold and gold stocks while the dollar is strong and the dollar price of gold is historically low The dollar is currently declining as foreign capital looks for investments elsewhere causing the dollar-denominated price of gold to rise Online investors need to consider the best way of gaining these diversification benefits The problem with using funds is that they can vary from the conservative to the daring from those mainly holding bullion to those trading derivatives Thankfully some specialist websites provide the type of data which was previously near impossible for the private investor to obtain Mining shares are the obvious way to link into the price of gold But if I want to tap into gold for its diversification effects I do not necessarily want to be exposed to the management skills of any one particular company Consequently gold mining companies are not of particular interest correlated though they are to the price of gold Similarly gold is not particularly attractive for its short-term trading opportunities if we want to have the diversification benefits the metal offers So trading in gold futures options and spread bets is strictly for those less concerned about diversification For the golden benefits to a portfolio I prefer direct investment in the metal coins such as the Krugerrand and the Canadian maple leaf They are easily acquired and tradable without the complications of other direct investments in gold Most private investors would only be recommended by financial advisers depending on personal circumstances to hold around 6 per cent of their total long-term holdings in gold There is one further unique property of gold if you like continuity its staying power Gold will still be here in 100 years only one company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains in the Dow from one hundred years ago General Electric alpesh@pathburner com,2
2002-06-10, The notion of pension fund surpluses conjures up riches for employees Small wonder that they are the object of so much litigation The often-asked question of 'who owns the surplus' as one lawyer wrote is one of the most misguided inquiries since the search for the philosopher's stone  But that does not deter the litigation Last month one of the longest running cases involving a British Airways' pension scheme that was closed to new members as long ago as 1984 reached its climax in London's Court of Appeal And as so often happens in such closely contested cases both sides claimed victory George Bell chairman of the Association of British Airways Pensioners says the ruling was a victory for members of the pension scheme But if you talk to Hugh Arthur head of the pensions business at Macfarlanes the City law firm that acted for the trustees in the case he will tell you that the trustees won Mr Bell's retort is blunt The trustees would say that wouldn't they The ownership of the surplus has assumed new prominence as companies investors and employees have realised the significance of a pension fund with a surplus or deficit We appreciate that this is a complex topic that most investors and analysts would prefer to ignore Morgan Stanley the US investment bank said in a report published last month But as we have seen recently with the bankruptcy of several US companies that had a cash funding call for their pensions the risks of ignorance are high  Paul Myners former chairman of Gartmore Investment Management the US-owned fund manager noted in his government-commissioned review that the current lack of clarity about ownership of any surplus assets is damaging One of the problems surrounding the pension surplus relates to definition Mr Arthur says It is only on winding-up when all the scale entitlements have been satisfied that a definite surplus can be said to have crystallised  Until then he suggests the surplus does not exist There is no pot of money But this is disputed by some pensioners among them the members of the British Airways scheme The controversial case revolved around the interpretation of a clause in the scheme's trust deed This dealt with how the trustees should parcel out any disposable surplus in the pension fund The Court of Appeal ruled that any disposable surplus could not be returned to British Airways nor could it be divided up and shared among the pensioners The decision in Mr Arthur's view was a further development of the courts' awareness of the need to see a surplus other than as a piggy-bank that can be dished out to the company or to the pensioners Mr Bell takes a different view What it has done is give the trustees clear guidance on what to do when there is a disposable surplus he says The Court of Appeal's judgment is in many ways neutral which is why both sides claim to have come out as winners Mr Arthur says The trustees won because the right of the trustees to act prudently to make further reserves out of any surplus has been upheld  But he acknowledges that this was not an unreserved victory The pensioners won in the sense that the theoretical right of British Airways to take a refund on the basis of the current rules has been prevented  The Court of Appeal judgment says that the situation in which the whole of a surplus can be said to be permanent is likely to be exceptional and may only occur when the fund is close to dissolution In effect it ruled that no pension fund surplus can be considered permanent enough to warrant its removal during the life of the fund Only at the winding-up of the fund could the surplus be shared out in some way This does not of course mean that part of a surplus might not be used to enhance members' benefits In theory says Mr Bell if there is a surplus in future unless the trustees come up with a very good reason for reserves then they are going to have a surplus to dispose of and it would have to be disposed of as benefits for the members of the fund  Pension funds tend to differ depending on the provisions of each scheme but the principle of the British Airways case is likely to hold good There have been suggestions that the European Union might want to legislate on the ownership of surpluses But Mr Arthur believes that the case is a warning shot across their bows It demonstrates to the EU how misguided it would be to do that  For Mr Arthur there are fundamentals here that make no sense to second-guess In defining ownership of a surplus he says you are denying the actuarial and legal fact of life that the surplus is only what is left after every beneficiary has been bought out and the longer people live the more the trustees need to be prudent  The controversy is unlikely to die down In a recent survey conducted by Lane Clark & Peacock the UK actuarial consultancy 25 of the 47 FTSE 100 companies who published their accounts using the new FRS17 reporting standard revealed that they boasted a pension surplus Overall the pension funds' aggregate position showed a £5bn surplus with BP Amoco BAA Associated British Foods and Rio Tinto enjoying some of the largest surpluses In Europe according to Morgan Stanley BP Amoco's surplus was topped by those of Novartis and Royal Dutch Shell whose surpluses exceeded {XEU}4 5bn at the end of 2001 These kind of numbers can only prompt employees as well as the investing public to ask a few questions about ownership of the pension surplus ,2
2002-06-28, CNH the Fiat-controlled industrial equipment maker expects to break even in 2002 after cutting its net debt from $5 6bn to $4bn over the past year CNH has weathered bleak conditions in its core agricultural and construction machinery markets but has been weighed by the debt burden from the $4 5bn cash acquisition of US-based Case by Fiat's New Holland business three years ago The merged business was renamed CNH The Chicago-based company is midway through a financial restructuring which has seen Fiat exchange $1 3bn of CNH debt for equity CNH raised a further $200m with the placement of 50m new shares By supporting the capital restructuring Fiat appears to consider the chances of rapid financial recovery at CNH higher than at its loss- making Fiat Auto car division Coupled with the cost savings and efficiencies from the industrial restructuring the re-organisation of CNH was expected to reduce the total debt-to-equity ratio from 75 per cent last year to 54 per cent in 2002 The target was to further reduce the ratio to 40 per cent Our real problem has been the financial structure of the company and our debt which was not generated by operations but by the acquisition cost of Case said Paolo Monferino CNH's chief executive Mr Monferino said the company had already exceeded its original savings targets When we put the companies together we planned to achieve $600m in synergies and efficiencies by 2004 We have already achieved $430m well ahead of schedule and more than expected he said The latest target is to achieve $850m of savings by the end of the restructuring and integration process Mr Monferino defended the logic of acquiring Case but conceded that the price had been high At the time the industry was at the top of its cycle and the stock market and merger and acquisition activity were booming The company with sales of $9 7bn last year has been rationalising its manufacturing system and developing common product platforms for its two global brands New Holland and Case It has so far closed or sold 16 of its 60 plants Five more will be closed by 2004 with the loss of an additional 1000 jobs The company had already shed 8500 jobs since the merger ,2
1998-04-01, Shares in Chiroscience the UK biotechnology company jumped 23 per cent yesterday after it announced Zeneca the pharmaceuticals company would commercialise its anaesthetic Chirocaine Both companies said the deal should bring in £200m in revenues for Chiroscience but John Padfield Chiroscience's chief executive said this figure was deliberately conservative As part of the deal Zeneca the UK's third largest pharmaceuticals company will pay £15m for 3 17 per cent of the company in newly issued shares That investment values the shares at 425p each compared with yesterday's closing price of 323{1/2}p Analysts have long expected the deal and the share price rise confirms Chiroscience's position as one of the UK's top three biotechnology companies by market value behind British Biotech and Shire Pharmaceuticals Chiroscience floated in 1992 at 150p a share Chirocaine is likely to be launched in its first European markets this year Chiroscience plans to submit it for US regulatory approval this month with the launch there likely next year The deal is the latest in a series by Chiroscience Last month it signed a collaboration agreement with US company Bristol-Myers Squibb and last year it agreed a similar contract with US drugs company Schering-Plough Chirocaine is a long-acting local anaesthetic that is a purified version of an old drug bupivacaine that is sold under the trade name Marcaine Bupivacaine is a mixture of two molecules that are chemically identical but physically are mirror images of each other Use of bupivacaine is limited by side-effects that are associated with one of the mirror images and have been linked with 90 deaths since it was launched in the 1970s Chirocaine is the other mirror image so the two companies believe it will both replace bupivacaine and allow new uses so far prevented through fear of side-effects Bupivacaine's patents have expired but those protecting Chirocaine last until 2014 It is likely to be used mostly in surgery and in pain relief during childbirth ,2

2002-06-13, Stanley Fink chief executive of Man Group has become one of highest paid executives in the FTSE 100 index after receiving a hefty £3 2m pay package last year Mr Fink received a £2 75m cash bonus and basic salary and benefits of £469000 for the 12 months to March 31 putting the 44-year-old in the premier pay league His cash pay-out exceeds the £3 07m salary and bonus paid last year to Lord Browne chief executive of oil major BP a company with a market capitalisation 41 times larger than Man Group However Man said that the pay-out reflected a year of sharp growth by the hedge fund manager high returns to shareholders and the beating of demanding performance targets Harvey McGrath chairman said Man had a culture of paying relatively low basic pay but high bonuses if performance targets were met Over the year to March 31 the shares rose by 43 5 per cent propelling the former commodities broker into the FTSE 100 It was the second highest riser in the index last year Mr McGrath said the cash bonus had been triggered by significant growth in underlying earnings per share Man lifted underlying earnings per share last year by 50 per cent raising the compound growth rate over the last four years to 46 per cent Mr McGrath defined underlying earnings as net fund management fees and net brokerage income It did not include the more volatile performance fees Man received for the management of its funds He said that Man's return on equity of 33 per cent last year had also beaten targets by a significant margin In addition the group was on track to meet its target set in March 2001 of doubling assets under management Last year assets under management rose from £6 7bn to £10 7bn Since selling the last of its agricultural commodities business in late 1999 the company established in 1783 has changed its name from ED&F Man and aggressively moved into the booming hedge fund market Last month it announced plans to buy RMF its Swiss rival and become the world's largest hedge fund group Mr McGrath said Mr Fink's peers who had set up their own hedge fund business would expect to receive rewards many times that of the Man chief executive ,2
2002-06-05, Private affairs Geneva's private bankers have always felt themselves to be a cut above UBS and Credit Suisse The latter have shareholders to pay for their mistakes and would presumably scoff at the idea that keeping the family name going was more important than doing deals to boost the bottom line Nevertheless after Wall Street's Goldman Sachs and London's Cazenove threw in the towel as private partnerships Geneva's private banks looked like the last bastions of an outdated business model That is not how it appeared this week in Geneva where Lombard Odier and Darier Hentsch announced they were merging after 200 years apart Darier Hentsch the weaker of the two could easily have sold itself to one of the wealthy foreign predators circling Switzerland's private banking industry Pierre de Weck an ex-UBS top honcho who heads Deutsche Bank's private banking operations is certainly on the prowl One of his relations is a Lombard Odier partner But de Weck comes from a Catholic family and Geneva's banks pride themselves on their Protestant tradition So poor old Deutsche Bank may have to content itself with a long-overdue bid for Zurich's Bank Vontobel ,1
2002-04-27, Perhaps in sympathy with their master the burly bodyguards of Jean-Marie Le Pen leader of the extreme-right National Front have their communication devices plugged into their right ears Since his surprise performance last Sunday winning his way to a run-off in the French presidential election against the incumbent Jacques Chirac Mr Le Pen has needed extra protection Wherever this former paratrooper goes he provokes a hostile reception and on the streets of cities throughout France thousands have protested daily against his xenophobic views Even in a television studio Mr Le Pen must be given a fair crack of the media whip there is a slight frisson when Christine Ockrent one of France's most experienced programme presenters shakes his hand It is as if she is supping with the devil Mr Le Pen relishes his role as a symbol of protest And when the establishment attacks him the well-prepared Mr Le Pen is only too pleased Ironically it is when commentators pick through the the details of the National Front's programme details which are on the face of it less offensive to the majority that Mr Le Pen seems less comfortable The interview gets underway challenging him about having achieved exactly the opposite of what he hoped getting Mr Chirac re-elected and himself demonised as a destroyer of democracy Not at all retorts Mr Le Pen The destroyer is Jacques Chirac the heir of Charles de Gaulle who has done most to destroy de Gaulle's work advantage my adversary is Jacques Chirac  And what about his programme Does he not want to pull out of Europe I've got nothing against Europe he says But the tirade begins all the same Europe represents nothing but weaknesses    France should leave Europe so long as it limits French independence  But this means withdrawing from the euro Yes and a return to the franc  Does this mean tearing up the Treaty of Rome Not really  What does he want then Mr Le Pen rattles into the theme of the historical error of creating Europe    creating an empire when empires were failing How would he avoid a run on the currency and inflation Norway and Switzerland are doing very well! But surely France and French companies are linked to a system of world trade Mr Le Pen replies with a defence of national industries of protecting French jobs against cheap imports Is this not autarchy No France has to fight the negative effects of gloablisation Yes French interests may overlap with those of Europe but there is no need to set up inefficient Maginot lines How will the economy pay for the tax cuts he proposes Cut wasteful state spending There is FFr800bn £74bn of wastage  But is he not seeking to spend more on defence and the security forces Of course I will eliminate income tax and inheritance tax  But the less well-off for whom you speak do not pay income tax in France Unanswered Mr Le Pen then expands on how in France people don't work enough and on the need for free enterprise behind protected borders France has a acquired a Sovietoid economy he complains The Socialists are only proposing to share penury  But your opponent is of the right   Mr Le Pen sees the future for the French economy in forging closer ties with French-speaking countries where the glory of France shines We don't want to sink into the European magma   which leads on to Asia Minor and then Bangladesh  Time runs out with Mr Le Pen having never once studied his notes Throughout he has hardly paused his barrel chest seemingly filled with a never-ending supply of robust phrases and with the details conveniently stripped out He smiles as if relieved he has not lost his famous temper ,3
1998-04-03, The government should act to prevent a crisis in British science by increasing public funding of research according to two separate reports published yesterday A report from Save British Science the leading scientists' pressure group said the government needed to double public spending on research and development over the next 10 years to help the UK catch up with other countries' R&D efforts The Save British Science report was backed by big industrial research spenders Glaxo Wellcome and Pfizer the pharmaceutical companies and British Telecommunications The second report from the Commons science and technology committee concluded There is an overwhelming case for a substantial real-terms increase in government expenditure on research  But the MPs focused on the immediate crisis in university research The infrastructure for academic science in the UK was crumbling they said and we recommend that this issue be treated with the utmost priority in the comprehensive spending review  The committee urged the government to allocate £420m of new money to rebuilding the academic infrastructure over the next three years Without substantial and sustained public investment the government will be putting the nation's future prosperity and quality of life at risk it said Save British Science took a wider view Its report launched at the Royal Society in front of senior university and industrial researchers pointed out public investment in civil R&D had fallen from 0 72 per cent of gross domestic product in 1981 to 0 43 per cent The UK was 16th out of 18 comparable countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development The group said a doubling of public spending on R&D over the next 10 years was not an ambitious objective it is a necessary one The increase from about £2 6bn a year now to £5 2bn in 2008 would enable the UK to catch up with where many other nations are now and match the further advances in public funding now seriously contemplated in the US and elsewhere  The US National Research Investment Act which calls for a doubling of federal support of science over 10 years is making progress in Congress with bipartisan support said John Mulvey director of Save British Science President Bill Clinton's proposed 1999 budget adds 8 per cent to basic research spending ,3

2002-06-19, The dust has been gathering on the acquisition chequebook at Computer Associates just one of many fundamental changes that Sanjay Kumar has brought to one of the world's largest software companies in less than two years Mr Kumar is chief executive and president of CA he assumed the role in August 2000 when co-founder Charles Wang stepped down from the job after 25 years to become chairman For most of its life CA has been known as an aggressive acquirer of dozens of software companies But since Mr Kumar took the helm the focus has been on reorganisation the introduction of a new business model and internal growth and handling a number of external challenges These have included the impact of an economic downturn recently-announced inquiries by the Securities Exchange Commission SEC and US Attorney's Office into CA's accounting practices and last year's fractious proxy battle with Sam Wyly a Texas billionaire that threatened to unseat Mr Kumar Mr Wang and the incumbent board of directors In a recent interview however 38-year-old Mr Kumar did not duck questions on any of these issues and acknowledged the many changes he has helped bring to the company He started by talking about CA's move away from its traditionally growth-by-acquisition strategy We have been a big acquirer historically it has been two years and two months since we have done any large deals he said jokingly comparing CA's historical penchant for acquisition with the need that a heavy drinker has for an evening nightcap It's like we've gone two years and two months without a drink we have gone dry Our focus has really been on internal growth  Mr Kumar adds however that a future acquisition is not totally out of the question merely unlikely at the moment You can never rule out an acquisition when you are a public company but we have so much focus on customer services right now that it wouldn't make sense to make acquisition short of a real strategic one to upset that  Meanwhile he says the introduction of a new business model in October 2000 one which allows the company to sell its software on the basis of a renewable month-to-month contract for its services rather than a single one-time license has made it easier to move forward in hard times The reason is that customers do not have to commit to a huge cost before implementing a CA solution They can also implement solutions in stages and buy components of the solution in a modular fashion In addition the company has simplified its brands with just seven main umbrella brands to cover its entire business Unicenter for infrastructure management BrightStor for storage management eTrust for security management CleverPath for portal and business intelligence AllFusion for application life cycle management Advantage for data management and application development and Jasmine for object-oriented database technology Where the opportunity does exist during the downturn is in the area of getting a faster and more definite return on results explains Mr Kumar This is an environment where decision times have been lengthened due to the economy and customers are feeling a bit of pain from technology decisions they have made over the past few years So we are saying that this is an alternative to spending six months evaluating a product and then another three months agonising over it In the past the industry would all go in there and ask for long term deals and that is a decision with permanence Our new business model says we afford flexibility customers can buy it a month at a time and we only recognise revenue a month at a time And if it doesn't work customers can just throw us out That approach has been very successful that has been the sweet spot  Ironically the company says it has been this new approach to recognising revenue that has also drawn the attention of the SEC and the US Attorney's Office On April 12 Computer Associates said it was continuing to co-operate fully with the preliminary inquiry and that it continues to believe that its accounting for revenues from multi-year software-licensing agreements which it had consistently applied since the early 1980s was proper The company further stated that recognising such revenue up front was not only required by GAAP generally accepted accounting principles but also consistent with the practice of most software companies even today Mr Kumar echoed these comments and suggested further that the current post-Enron climate among investors regulators and Wall Street commentators makes it difficult to concentrate on building value for shareholders He said that worries of class action lawsuits can cause executives in some companies to be fearful of talking in detail about their operations The problem today in a very litigious society in the US is that we have got to the point where we are not allowing business people to describe and talk about their business Mr Kumar adds Given the extremes of shareholder litigation what companies are doing is simply relying on disclosure of black and white numbers Investors want to have a conversation with you in the annual report but if you don't have a zillion accountants and lawyers to go through the document they are going to have your head We are missing the big picture There needs to be a greater emphasis on the right to be able to talk about the risks of the business without it coming back to haunt you Right now every single word that one utters can come back to haunt them I'm not sure that environment is healthy  If Mr Kumar sounds feisty it's probably in part due to the warm-up he and chairman Charles Wang had last year in their proxy fight with Mr Wyly who wanted to replace Mr Wang and Mr Kumar along with the entire existing CA board of directors with candidates of his choosing Mr Wang and Mr Kumar both took a high-profile role in the proxy battle with Mr Wyly with Mr Wang offering some perspective given the many other battles he has fought in running the company for almost a quarter of a century Each battle is new because your enemy or foe is different and the weapons used are different Mr Wang said Mr Kumar concedes however that the company did learn something from the proxy battle It clearly brought the company together his attacks as an attempt to vilify us really galvanised the team he says ,1
2002-04-24, The courtroom battle over Hewlett-Packard's $19bn bid for Compaq Computer began in dramatic fashion yesterday as Carly Fiorina chief executive took the stand to deny accusations that her company lied to investors ahead of last month's shareholder vote Attorneys for Walter Hewlett the HP director whose lawsuit could still derail the deal began the day with strong assertions that seemed to back up claims that HP knowingly made false statements to shareholders about the progress of HP's integration efforts The Hewlett camp also argued it had powerful although circumstantial evidence indicating that HP in effect bribed Deutsche Asset Management at the last minute into voting 17m shares in favour of the deal even though it had already indicated it would vote against the merger A preliminary vote count showed that HP shareholders on March 19 backed the company's merger bid by a slim 45m share margin or about 3 per cent of votes cast Mr Hewlett's camp has indicated it would review and challenge the results a process that could be completed by next week While the allegations about Deutsche Bank were initially seen to be the most explosive claims in Mr Hewlett's lawsuit the Hewlett side spent much of the first day in court trying to demonstrate that internal HP documents showed the company's integration efforts were not achieving the targets HP had provided in public documents and presentations Stephen Neal a lawyer for Mr Hewlett told the court that a small group of HP and Compaq executives received regular updates on the integration teams' efforts to plan the merger ,1
2002-06-13, The cost of consigning the Consignia name to history could top £1m it emerged yesterday ahead of the announcement of plans to rename itself Royal Mail The main cost of the move to call itself Royal Mail is expected to be altering the Consignia signs on all its 3000 buildings to meet company law requirements The Consignia name was adopted when the Post Office Group received plc status in March 2001 But it became one of the most ridiculed corporate rebrandings in recent memory and synonimous with the financial crisis engulfing the company Consignia stressed the change to the Royal Mail name which would take place in months not weeks would be done at as little cost as possible Vans and uniforms are already branded as either Royal Mail or Parcelforce The company spent £2m when it became Consignia of which £500000 was the cost of the name change Stocks of items with the Consignia name on them will be used up probably by the end of the year before new ones are ordered with the Royal Mail label We think we can do this in a way that generally places the minimum burden on the company Consignia said It is likely to lose its website under the rebranding with the information going to the Royal Mail site Critics of the Consignia name welcomed the proposed change Billy Hayes general secretary of the Communication Workers' Union said If a decision is taken to get rid of the ludicrous Consignia title the union will be pleased to see the back of it  The rebranding plans will be detailed today by Allan Leighton chairman as he announces losses for the year of £1 1bn and 17000 job cuts John Roberts chief executive is expected to outline his future at the company with the government set to begin the search for his successor Mr Leighton the driving force behind dropping the Consignia name who has combined his role at the company with 10 other directorships yesterday resigned as a non-executive director of Scottish Power He currently spends two days a week at Consignia although expectations are growing that he may devote more of his time to the company  The CWU could ballot more than 200000 postal workers on industrial action in protest at plans to outsource support services including cleaners' jobs writes Press Association The dispute involves plans to outsource Consignia's facilities services business Romec which is responsible for maintenance of the company's 3000 buildings The plan would save Consignia £60m a year but the union fears it could be the start of more privatisation ,2

2002-06-10, Rupert Murdoch has agreed to pay {XEU}1 5bn £970m to take over Vivendi Universal's Telepiu` pay-TV unit in a deal that could see News Corporation become the sole pay-TV operator in Italy The agreement however hinges upon News Corp finding other investors a move that would reduce its stake in the venture to 50 per cent It must also be approved by Italian and possibly European Union antitrust regulators I'd say there's a 75 per cent chance the deal goes through but it depends on finding investors and on the regulators said a person familiar with the memorandum of understanding between the two groups News Corp already owns 50 per cent of Stream Telepiu`'s rival in Italy According to people familiar with the talks Telecom Italia which owns the other 50 per cent of Stream will agree to increase its stake in the combined group if News Corp's bid is successful The accord ends months of bitter talks and threatened legal action between Mr Murdoch and Jean-Marie Messier chief executive of Vivendi as both their Italian operations pile up massive losses Vivendi's Telepiu` and News Corp's Stream last year lost an estimated {XEU}750m combined and are on track for a similar loss this year Vivendi last winter agreed to acquire Stream from News Corp but last month cancelled the deal when Italy's antitrust authority imposed conditions that the French company said would make it difficult to make a profit News Corp at first threatened to sue Vivendi for pulling out of the deal but decided it could accept the antitrust's conditions and make a profit from the combined pay-TV units Under pressure from ratings agencies to slash its borrowings Vivendi said the Telepiu` transaction would reduce its {XEU}17 1bn debt by {XEU}1 2bn But the deal also marks another setback for the embattled Mr Messier who had hoped to create a pan-European pay-TV platform using Telepiu` Italy's market leader and Canal Plus of France Canal Plus last year lost {XEU}500m at the operating free cashflow level News Corp will pay {XEU}650m in cash if the deal is completed probably during the last quarter of this year It will also assume {XEU}550m in debt and pay off a {XEU}300m loan in five years' time that Vivendi made to Telepiu` Analysts estimate that for the venture to break even News Corp would need between 3 5m-4m customers That compares with the 2 35m that Stream and Telepiu` have combined Part of the difficulty will be to convince pirate customers of the pay-TV platforms to pay for the service www ft com/telecoms,1

2002-04-19, The Bucharest Stock Exchange's BET index is close to a record high after a few weeks of hectic trading pushed it close to its 1997 peak It closed yesterday at 978 55 up 2 6 per cent but analysts expect it to top the 1040 level by the end of next week The 1997 boom came among much optimism after the election of a reformist centre-right government But their ambitions and those of the stock exchange and country were stymied by infighting in the ruling coalition and corruption The boom quickly petered out and the country experienced three years of recession According to Dragos Neacsu chairman of Raiffeisen Capital Investment and a Bucharest Stock Exchange board member the recent rise is sustainable It is not just a sudden jump Through 2001 and so far in 2002 the index's rate of increase has been rising at a rate superior to the region and Western Europe  Mr Neacsu says a mixture of Romanian and international factors has prompted the rise He believes recent changes in legislation and capital markets' regulations led to investor interest The new regulations gave increased protection to minority shareholders This was an area of discontent previously he says Prior changes in regulations also made it easier for companies to delist This led to a cleaning process because the companies that remain had the potential for attracting funds says Mr Neacsu He also believes that a number of government successes have led to the recent boom Inflation for March was the lowest since the fall of communism Also the government recently signed a letter with the IMF that contained precise deadlines for a list of painful reform measures and a timetable This basically means that the government is going to be monitored on a monthly basis for the next six months he said Mr Neacsu believes this will allow foreign investors to check if the government is serious about reform According to Dragos Cabat president of the Romanian association of investment professionals the hope that foreign investors will enter the Romanian capital markets is partly behind the peak The index will continue to go up but this has not been caused by foreign investors It is mostly opportunism in domestic investors expecting foreign inflows he says He also believes that the herd instinct among investors is fuelling the boom Some stocks are good stocks and are picking up deserved attention from investors while others that are not as deserving are picking up because of the market trend he says Mr Cabat believes the recent sharp rises in the BET index are over and will be replaced by more modest rises The boom will consolidate the increase will continue but at a lower percentage than recently  Phelim McAleer,2

2002-06-19, At least seven rival private equity firms have approached Madison Dearborn Partners seeking to join the US private equity firm in its {XEU}3 7bn £2 4bn takeover of Jefferson Smurfit the Irish packaging group Blackstone and Texas Pacific Group the US private equity firms are thought to be among those interested in joining Madison Dearborn's offer one of the largest ever for an Irish company The interest from the firms is preliminary and no in-depth talks have taken place with Madison Dearborn or with Smurfit management But industry observers expect Madison Dearborn to take on partners because most private equity firms are cautious about any fund being too concentrated in one investment Some of the firm's investors have also expressed an interest in putting additional money into the investment The firm may wait until after the transaction is closed The Chicago-based private equity firm will spend up to {XEU}750m £484m of its $8bn £5 4bn fund on the acquisition if shareholders approve it The firm will raise the rest in debt Jefferson Smurfit management are being offered the chance to buy up to {XEU}75m of the equity The management that are buying into the equity includes Michael Smurfit chairman and chief executive Gary McGann chief operating officer and chief executive designate Anthony Smurfit chief executive of the European group and chief operating officer designate and Ian Curley chief financial officer They will be able to invite up to 200 more managers to join them The transaction comes at a time when there are few attractive takeover candidates and many private equity firms are flush with cash that they need to invest lest their investors ask for it back Some firms have lost money on the telecoms and technology sector and could find the profitability and relative stability of an old economy business such as paper and packaging attractive A rival offer from another firm is unlikely While Jefferson Smurfit may have been undervalued the price is 38 per cent higher than the day before it said it had received a takeover approach that could lead to an offer Madison Dearborn is also considered to be one of the private equity industry's specialists in paper and packaging so industry experts say a rival is likely to defer to them on valuation Madison Dearborn's other industry investments include Bay State Paper a manufacturer of recycled containerboard Buckeye Technologies which makes speciality cellulose pulps and Packaging Corporation of America a maker of containerboard and corrugated cardboard Other investments are PaperExchange com an internet-based marketplace for the paper industry and Riverwood Holding the world's largest manufacturer of coated unbleached paperboard used in drink cartons Lex Page 24,1

2002-06-14, European Union countries yesterday backed plans for joint management of external borders in an effort to stem illegal immigration signalling a tougher approach towards developing countries A week before the EU's Seville summit interior ministers urged countries that are the source of illegal migrants to stamp out people-trafficking and warned of an immediate political reaction if they failed to do so However ministers backed away from proposing economic sanctions as a punishment for non-cooperation We cannot convince these countries to take back immigrants through sanctions said Nicolas Sarkozy French interior minister We cannot give out the message that rich countries will punish poor countries  Illegal immigration will top the agenda at Seville as EU leaders attempt to regain the initiative after a number of anti-immigration politicians have secured stunning election successes Previous summits have made similar pushes without success But David Blunkett home secretary said he detected a real will to get this sorted out Britain Spain and Italy have led the latest campaign for tough new measures including the suggestion from Tony Blair prime minister that the EU should use its economic and financial clout to put pressure on countries that are unwilling to help the EU The European Commission hopes the Seville summit will give renewed impetus to the drive to create a common asylum and immigration policy for the EU which has become bogged down by national sensitivities The rate of work has been slow and we need to speed things up after Seville said Antonio Vitorino justice and home affairs commissioner Yesterday's move came just over a month after the Commission called for the creation of a European border guard corps Some countries such as Britain oppose an EU force but back pooling resources and sharing the financial burden Ministers set out a list of measures non-EU countries should take to clamp down on illegal migration They pledged to respond firmly to countries that did not co-operate Rhetoric put to the test Page 7 Editorial comment Page 18 www ft com/europe,3
2002-06-07, Nortel Networks was last night on the verge of pricing an $800m offering of shares and convertible securities after a week that saw the networking company's share price tumble to levels not seen in almost two decades The fact that Nortel was proceeding with the issue amid the current Wall Street gloom suggested the company was increasingly desperate to shore up its cash reserves to help it outlast the prolonged downturn in telecommunications spending Shares in Nortel which started the week at $2 21 have been hammered by short sellers over the past few days in anticipation of the pending offering Nortel shares sank another 12 per cent yesterday to close at $1 41 in New York Some company watchers suggested the offering would dilute Nortel's 3 2bn share base by an additional 450m-500m shares Critics have argued that Nortel made a crucial mistake by delaying the offering in hopes the market would rebound Instead the outlook for telecoms spending has only become worse in the recent months with a rebound not expected until late 2003 or 2004 As a result Nortel's slumping share price has made the issue all the more dilutive as the company has to issue more shares in order to raise the same amount of financing The Canadian company has $4 8bn in debt and UBS Warburg recently forecast that Nortel would need to raise at least $1 6bn to remain properly funded through 2003 People familiar with the situation said the offering was due to be priced later on Thursday and that the common stock issue was twice oversubscribed while the convertible offering was three times oversubscribed ,2
2002-06-04, When Dennis Kozlowski took control of Tyco Laboratories in 1993 the company was a mid-market manufacturer with annual sales of $3bn The company he resigned from yesterday just six months short of his 10th anniversary as chairman and chief executive is unrecognisable in all but name from the one he inherited Perhaps more than any conglomerate of the past decade Tyco was a company moulded in one man's vision It is almost inconceivable that in its current form it could outlast its creator Indeed Mr Kozlowski's departure will probably only serve to hasten a break-up that already seemed inevitable Even before he informed Tyco's board late last week that he was facing a criminal investigation Mr Kozlowski's dream of creating a company that could rival General Electric in size and global reach was already in tatters Mr Kozlowski had admitted this as far back as January when he unveiled a radical plan to break up Tyco into four parts The sudden change in strategy which caught investors completely off- guard was a response to what Mr Kozlowski saw as the unfair discount which the market attached to Tyco's steady record of earnings growth But the timing of the move which coincided with a crisis of corporate credibility in the wake of the collapse of Enron could hardly have been worse Within weeks Tyco's share price had halved and the company was forced to draw down almost $14bn in emergency credit lines It was not until April however that Mr Kozlowski's little remaining credibility on Wall Street completely evaporated He performed a complete strategic U-turn by abandoning the break-up plan and scrapping the planned sale of Tyco's plastics businesses Instead Tyco would solve its debt problems by selling its entire stake in its CIT financial unit in an initial public offering Ever since most investors have taken the view that Mr Kozlowski's days were numbered But Mr Kozlowski insisted he was staying And few expected Tyco's board which is largely packed with former Tyco executives and entrepreneurs who have made their fortunes selling their businesses to Mr Kozlowski to challenge him As recently as last week when rumours of Mr Kozlowski's impending departure were posted on an internet gossip site it denied he was leaving It was only on Friday when Mr Kozlowski informed the board that he was facing a criminal investigation that the board finally concluded he had to go A little less than a decade after he handed over to Mr Kozlowski John Fort the former chief executive finds himself in charge of a company facing a formidable challenge Although Mr Fort is clearly only acting as a stop-gap until a new chief executive can be found it could take several months before Tyco is able to find someone willing to take on the reins of such a troubled company In the meantime Mr Fort must oversee the initial public offering of CIT which had been scheduled to be completed by the end of this month The process is likely to be brutal Wall Street investors are fully aware that Tyco needs the cash proceeds from the IPO now likely to be about $5bn to relieve the pressure on its balance sheet What is more any delays to the IPO could lead to a further decline in the performance of CIT which has been cut off from the commercial paper markets since February Without the ability to issue commercial paper which it relies on to refinance the leasing obligations it takes on CIT's business will slowly wither Tyco yesterday insisted that the IPO process remained on track It also attempted to reassure investors by reaffirming its previous earnings guidance Yet the loss of Mr Kozlowski is bound to raise questions about the performance of the rest of the business The first question is whether Mr Kozlowski's trusted lieutenants who include Mark Swartz chief financial officer and the heads of Tyco's divisions will stick around much longer The company's competitors especially in already troubled industries such as electronics will also make the most of the continued turmoil at Tyco Jittery suppliers and customers are likely to be further rattled raising the risk of additional business disruptions Jeffrey Sprague an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney wrote yesterday In the longer term the question remains whether Tyco once one of the most feared corporate predators in the world will itself become a takeover target Investment bankers yesterday argued that some of the company's businesses including its ADT fire and security division and its healthcare operations might make attractive acquisition targets However given the persistent questions about Tyco's acquisition-fuelled growth and aggressive accounting policies buyers are likely to be extremely wary Whatever the outcome one conclusion seems clear Mr Kozlowski oversaw the rise of a bull market company and ever since the boom ended Tyco's days have been numbered In a few years' time little if anything is likely to be left of his creation ,1

2002-04-24, Renault the French carmaker will this week appoint Carlos Ghosn Nissan chief executive to its board and seek shareholder approval for a corporate governance shake-up The appointment of Mr Ghosn clears the way for the potential succession to Louis Schweitzer Renault's veteran chairman Mr Schweitzer intends to retire in 2005 Mr Ghosn has told colleagues he plans to spend another three years at Nissan As part of the boardroom overhaul Renault will also cut the number of French government representatives on the board publish more details on executive pay and reduce the tenure of board directors from six to four years The changes due to be endorsed at the carmaker's general meeting on Friday follow an extension of the Renault-Nissan alliance Nissan has taken a 13 5 per cent holding in the French carmaker while Renault has raised its stake in the Japanese group from 36 8 per cent to 44 4 per cent That move prompted the French government to cut its Renault shareholding to 27 1 per cent last month down from 43 8 per cent at the end of 2001 Shareholders will be told on Friday that one of the French government's three board-members will make way for Mr Ghosn who will become the first director with a four-year mandate Existing Renault directors on six-year terms will move to shorter contracts or stand down when their current tenures expire The company is also due to appoint the first two non-executive directors to a new secretive foundation set up to protect Renault or Nissan from a hostile bid or creeping takeover by another carmaker Morris Tabaksblat chairman of Reed Elsevier the Anglo-Dutch publisher and Pierre Bilger chief executive of Alsthom the French power and transport equipment company will become members of the foundation The aim of the foundation is to separate control of Renault-Nissan's alliance operations from either parent company in the event of another carmaker taking a minority stake in either the French or Japanese group Officials said the proposals aimed to increase transparency at Renault while also complying with new rules on issues such as executive pay They played down prospects of Renault making a further trading statement on Friday beyond the cautious outlook issued in February when it reported annual operating profits down from {XEU}1 84bn $1 6bn to {XEU}473m Industry analysts welcomed the prospective boardroom changes and the arrival of Mr Ghosn Renault's former chief operating officer As Nissan president he has overseen a dramatic turnround at the Japanese carmaker Analysts pointed out that Nissan's buoyant share price meant Renault's stake in the company was now worth {XEU}17bn Renault itself however is capitalised at just {XEU}14 6bn ,2
2002-04-13, The US and European Com-mission yesterday unveiled plans aimed at preventing the sort of bilateral trade skirmishes caused by new regulations that have blighted transatlantic ties The new guidelines on regulatory co-operation which follow 2{1/2} years of negotiations will boost dialogue between the two at an early stage of the regulatory process attempt to show up any unintended effects of new laws publicise proposed rules and search for alternatives in cases where problems look likely to arise Although they are non-binding and do not cover regulations on agricultural products the guidelines were welcomed by both sides as a big contribution to efforts to ease the transatlantic trade relationship at a time when it is being severely tested by a dispute over steel The EU and US are each other's largest trading partner Co-operation between our regulators is therefore of particular importance said Erkki Liikanen the EU enterprise commissioner Increased co-operation   will facilitate trade in goods and minimise trade frictions  A number of tricky disputes have been triggered by different regulatory approaches in Europe and the US as each side has sought to exclude products from its marketplace The guidelines aim to compare the criteria used in selecting priorities for rule-making Brussels and Washington have differed widely on this subject in recent years since the Europeans began paying greater heed to what it perceives as health threats and animal welfare issues The recent dispute over EU plans to exclude US aircraft fitted with noise muffling devices resulted from the use of different technical standards By the same token the EU has experienced difficulties in selling pleasure boats in the US because of American technical requirements Each individual case may not look exciting on its own but when they accumulate you get problems Mr Liikanen said We hope with this new approach that we can avoid this sort of thing  The guidelines were negotiated under the so-called Transatlantic Economic Partnership a US-EU trade initiative launched in 1998 to improve bilateral trade co-operation They come as Pascal Lamy EU trade commissioner seeks to strengthen links with the US by instructing his staff to draft proposals for closer collaboration on projects such as a transatlantic open skies policy ,3
2002-06-21, General Electric's annual meeting in April began as it always begins with an invocation from a pastor We give you thanks for the many ways you have blessed this world-renowned corporation  It ended as it always ends with the chairman flying to Augusta Georgia for golf with selected directors and clients But this year's gathering in Waukesha Wisconsin was different For the first time in two decades the chairman was not Jack Welch who retired last September but his successor 46-year-old Jeffrey Immelt More important Mr Immelt was piloting GE through a combination of adverse circumstances and bad publicity that Mr Welch had not experienced for 10 years The new GE chief has had to deal with more than just the expected close attention to anew leader's performance He has had to face a near-perfect storm On his second full day in the job terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon Just as stocks were beginning to recover Enron collapsed focusing investor scrutiny on the growth record accounting practices and liquidity of other companies that had become icons during the bull market especially GE At the same time some of the biggest engines of the group's long-term growth notably GE Power Systems were beginning to stutter How Mr Immelt and GE have handled the crisis says much about the strengths of the group and its management But GE has not yet answered some of the fundamental questions about the future direction of the world's most valuable company which has seen its share price halve since its peak of $60 in August 2000 In particular can the old methods tried but not necessarily tested under Jack Welch's leadership continue to work in a period of slower economic growth and tougher attention to the inner workings of GE's accounts and operations Mr Immelt believes they can Indeed he and his senior managers think history has proved that going back to basics is the key to GE's continued success We've been through tough times before Lots of them he told shareholders in April And when we've hit those rough patches one thing always happens we always come out a stronger and better company This time will be no different  The same message has gone down the line to hundreds of senior managers In one of a series of interviews the FT has conducted with top GE executives in recent weeks Jim Campbell chief executive of GE Appliances the group's consumer appliance division said Jeff has told the business leaders and I've told my people that there's a lot of questions    but what this comes down to is we have to perform and we have to deliver the numbers that as a company we committed to  This may be easier said than done because GE is increasingly like a large shark it must keep moving and keep eating or perish Nani Beccalli the Italian executive who is the new head of GE in Europe says Our size means it is not very easy to achieve our growth targets intrinsically because you bump your head against the market share so we have to grow into new areas by acquisition  In order to continue growing GE will have to make bigger and bigger acquisitions Since the European Commission blocked GE's $43bn bid for Honeywell last year Mr Wright says the group is not out elephant- hunting But medium-sized deals that might transform the performance of a smaller company have a minimal impact on the bottom line growth of GE The percentage contribution to net income from the previous year's acquisitions has declined in each of the past three years GE's industrial side also needs to seek out acquisitions to offset lingering concerns about the proportion of earnings coming from GE Capital the financial division Obviously we would like the industrial side to grow faster says Jim Parke GE Capital's chief financial officer We would like to be a smaller proportion of overall earnings  This year should see a stronger contribution from acquisitions given that GE Capital ended 2001 with a flurry of purchases but some worry that reliance on deals will encourage further investor scepticism given the recent demise of high-profile deal-makers such as Bernie Ebbers at WorldCom and Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco Immelt is committed to growing that way and yet acquisitions are now such a discredited concept says one analyst Without deals and with economic recovery still uncertain GE is thrown back onto productivity improvements such as digitisation and cost-cutting But productivity improvements can only lead you so far once you squeeze the lemon you cannot do it again says Mr Beccalli and companies that deal with GE confirm the group has increased the pressure The company shows a clarity of direction and an ability to implement processes to make sure promises are delivered And they never give up says Rick Haythornthwaite chief executive of Invensys the UK controls and engineering group that is a GE competitor supplier and customer We've been through the wringer in the last couple of years more than usual adds Tim Duncan project engineer with Dynamic a manufacturer that supplies components for GE's transportation division The managing director of one British components manufacturer which deals almost exclusively with GE in Europe says It has become even more noticeable recently that the bills always get paid later and later towards the end of a financial quarter  On Wall Street the main concern is not how GE performs in 2002 Mr Immelt said last month that he expected little improvement in the economy in the second half of this year Instead all eyes are on 2003 That is when net profit from the power systems division really begins to fall away Mr Immelt claimed in May that early cycle indicators from cyclical businesses such as the NBC TV network and the plastics division show strong signs of recovery the aircraft engines division hard-hit following September 11 is reporting a pick-up in the sale of spare parts as more passengers return to the skies But investors will want more hard evidence when GE announces second-quarter results next month that these operations can bridge the gap left by dwindling profit from power systems next year Senior GE managers concede that although the group has seen economic cycles come and go since its formation in 1892 the challenge is particularly tough and the climate hostile this time Jeff's got a balancing act here of trying to get his income up in the face of some very adverse domestic and global circumstances says Robert Wright a GE vice-chairman and one of Mr Immelt's closest lieutenants Talking about the erosion of investor confidence following the spate of corporate collapses and scandals he adds This kind of corporate problem is really quite unusual    and the issue is impacting GE as it is other businesses  Arguably just as GE is larger than other companies it is worth $300bn and generates revenue of more than $125bn annually so the impact has been greater In the face of adversity Mr Immelt's instinct has been to produce more information about the company We can't change the overall global circumstances or the perception that exists in the US markets so we're taking the only option open to us to try to reinforce with bondholders and investors and rating agencies what our view of the performance is says Mr Wright Sometimes we get frustrated    So we go back to try and do it again and again in a different way We don't spend very much time bemoaning the situation  If the stock remains becalmed at its current level of about $30 investors may not be as philosophical Additional reporting by Peter Marsh,2
2002-04-16, Prices paid by manufact-urers for materials and fuel rose last month at the fastest pace in a year and a half prompting speculation that the Bank of England will delay raising interest rates However survey evidence suggested that Britons kept up their shopping spree threatening the Bank's ability to give succour to producers while keeping a rein on consumers Prices paid by manufacturers rose by 2 2 per cent in March according to the Office for National Statistics Prices were still 2 5 per cent down on the year but the annual decline was much less than February's rate of 7 4 per cent Costs were pushed up by the soaring price of oil fuelled by the continuing crisis in the Middle East The news suggests that manufacturers have pulled themselves out of a recession only to be hit immediately by a new crisis Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics said the rise in prices was a further squeeze on margins at a crucial stage of the budding industrial recovery But manufacturers responded to the increase in their costs by raising the prices they charge domestic customers by only 0 1 percentage points less even than February's tiny rise of 0 2 percentage points John Butler economist at HSBC said the tiny increase suggested manufacturers are unable to pass on even a global oil price shock That indicated added Mr Butler that retailers now have the pricing power at the expense of manufacturers British manufacturers have long complained that the persistent strength of sterling has made them uncompetitive even in their home market preventing them from raising prices Last year's global downturn made matters still worse by plunging the sector into recession The combination of low margins and falling demand pushed profitability down to a nine-year low Manufacturers are desperate to restore margins to provide the cash for long-term investment A sharp rise in oil prices usually prompts fears of higher interest rates but manufacturers' inability to pass the cost on has helped limit the rise in retail prices the Bank's yardstick for measuring inflationary pressure Some analysts had forecast an interest rate rise as soon as next month but many think the Bank will wait for clearer signs that manufacturing has found its feet before acting However the British Retail Consortium said the value of retail sales rose last month on a like-for-like basis at a six-year high of 7 5 per cent Sales of clothing and do-it-yourself products were particularly strong The BRC said inflationary pressure remained low but the Bank's monetary policy committee members have worried repeatedly in recent months about the British consumer's willingness to finance spending through borrowing taking advantage of low interest rates Manufacturers have tried to cut costs by cutting jobs Manufacturing productivity rose at its fastest pace in a year and a half last month according to a survey by Lloyds TSB and the Institute of Management Services www ft com/ukeconomy,2
1998-04-01, Further weakness in the underlying oil price following the latest pronouncement by Opec sent BP the UK major most exposed to oil prices sharply lower The shares fell 15 to 862p and the slide was responsible for much of the overall market weakness early on A joint agreement between Opec and non-Opec countries which will lead to cuts in global production of 1 5m barrels a day prompted Brent crude to fall more than 50 cents at one stage There was some disappointment that the cuts were not higher and John Toalster at SG Securities said the initiative lacked credibility But the slide was principally a testament to the tried and tested market technique of buying on rumour and selling on fact However analysts added that with the first quarter out of the way the market now had hard numbers to work into profit models Michael Mayer of Schroder & Co in New York predicts that first-quarter earnings will be 45 per cent below the levels seen a year ago UK brokers were slightly less pessimistic One said the majors would be shielded by improved refining margins and a lower tax charge Nevertheless they acknowledged that a fall of 32 per cent in the oil price since the first quarter last year and 14 per cent since the previous quarter is bound to weigh on earnings Talk of a tie-up between Asda and Next refused to die and sent both stocks higher Next heavily marked down last week following a profits warning received an additional boost from director share buying David Jones chief executive bought 100000 shares at 540p and the company added that the Next employee share option plan trust had purchased 1 25m at 546p Finally SG Securities published a buy recommendation arguing that recent weakness created a good long-term buying opportunity in a quality stock Next gained 29 to 579p Asda improved 7 to 202{1/2}p ,2

2002-06-07, Silvio Berlusconi Italy's prime minister yesterday took what may be the biggest gamble since he became premier by launching a {XEU}4 6bn $4 3bn project to build a bridge linking Sicily to the Italian peninsula Unveiling one of the largest construction projects planned in western Europe in recent years Mr Berlusconi and Pietro Lunardi infrastructure minister promised that the bridge which will be three times longer than San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge would be completed by 2010 For the last 30 years building a bridge across the Messina strait has been repeatedly mooted by Italian governments only to be abandoned after technical and political difficulties The failure to build the ponte sullo stretto has become an icon of Italy's inability to modernise its road and rail infrastructure Italy's centre-left opposition was highly sceptical about yesterday's announcement noting that it came days before the second round of local elections some of which are taking place in Sicily and Calabria This announcement has been timed with the elections in mind and it remains to be seen whether anything will actually happen said a spokesman for Francesco Rutelli opposition leader However Mr Berlusconi made an unusually firm commitment saying  This time we're going to do it I promise you  Mr Lunardi underlined the commitment by stating that the first stone would be laid in 2004 or early 2005 The bridge will be done At this point nothing is missing he said There's the political will and the technology is in place Work can begin  Mr Lunardi said construction was to be financed by a partnership between the public and private sectors with the government providing half of the total costs Plans published by the government underline the technical difficulty of building the bridge a project that is aimed at boosting the southern Italian economy and could create some 10000 jobs The bridge will be two miles long and 200ft wide and have 12 lanes carrying cars trucks and trains The bridge's towers will soar 1230ft above sea level However the project also poses big political challenges Since the second world war many ventures have been driven by kickbacks for politicians The south has also become renowned for the failure to complete projects ,3

2002-04-11, Only a few years ago Mexican presidents could do almost whatever they wanted Plenty of them managed to get away with robbery Now they need to ask permission before they can even leave the country President Vicente Fox had a nice trip planned for next week moving in the space of 48 hours from San Francisco through Seattle to Vancouver and Calgary He even planned to have a private dinner with Bill Gates Microsoft's co-founder But all the opposition parties in the Senate decided to block the trip A constitutional provision passed by Mexico's revolutionaries in 1917 but never before used requires the president to gain the permission of Congress before leaving the country Fox's foreign secretary called the decision an act of political revenge while the president went on television on Tuesday night to denounce the decision saying that it was against the interests of Mexico It is unlikely that peasants in Chiapas are distressed that he will now not be able to dine with the world's richest man but Fox was also planning to make vigorous attacks on the recent anti-immigrant rights ruling by the US Supreme Court Carefully positioned to take place in areas where the Hispanic vote can be pivotal this might have made quite a difference in the eyes of many ordinary Mexicans However Fox had no choice but to accept the Senate's decision Mexico's constitution has all along had much the same emphasis on the separation of powers as the US constitution It was simply that the domination of Mexican politics by the Institutional Revolutionary Party PRI which held power uninterrupted from the revolution until Fox's victory two years ago meant that presidents could ignore checks and balances The PRI controlled all the branches of power Now in opposition the PRI is enjoying itself reviving checks and balances which even the US Congress could scarcely imagine No doubt some Republican senators would have loved to ground Bill Clinton for example but it never happened Indeed rid of the one-party state it turns out that Mexican senators can be far more obstructive of presidential ambitions than their US counterparts They were all elected at the same time in 2000 and will all remain in office until 2006 when the president must depart He is stuck with them Fox can complain over their heads to the Mexican people but it will do no good Mexico's strict term limits mean that none of the senators can run for office again anyway so they have no need to listen to their own electors As far as the Institutional Revolutionaries are concerned it certainly looks like an act of political revenge and little else PRI senators including Manuel Bartlett and Humberto Roque Villanueva both of whom were once candidates for the party's presidential nomination in 2000 were photographed laughing and grinning as the result of the decision to ground Fox was announced Other senators said that Fox was an incessant traveller who should spend more time dealing with problems in Mexico Roberto Madrazo the pragmatic former governor of Tabasco who was elected to lead the party a month ago amid allegations of electoral fraud had called for the PRI to offer a constructive opposition and to work with the president Grounding him seems unlikely to achieve that result ,3

2002-04-26, Growth in the eurozonewill continue to lag behind the US this year and the European Central Bank will have no need to raise interest rates soon the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has said In its latest twice-yearly Economic Outlook the OECD the Paris-based group of industrialised countries predicted growth in its member countries of 1 8 per cent this year up from 1 per cent last year The upward revision almost doubling the OECD's previous forecast made late last year is in line with the general trend as reflected in the latest forecasts from the International Monetary Fund The pattern of growth is expected to be uneven however with the US displaying a much stronger recovery than the eurozone or Japan The OECD expects the US to grow by 2 5 per cent this year while the eurozone grows by 1 4 per cent and the Japanese economy contracts by 0 7 per cent In part the inferior performance of the eurozone is explained by a worse long-term growth rate of potential output which the OECD estimates at around 2 25 per cent compared with about 3 5 per cent for the US But the OECD also expects a slower cyclical upturn in the eurozone with unemploy-ment not starting to fall until late in the year Futures market rates suggest the ECB is likely to raise its main interest rate within the next six months but the OECD suggested that those expectations may be premature Ignazio Visco the OECD's chief economist said There is enough slack in the eurozone labour market that in the medium term the inflation rate will be below 2 per cent If this is so there is no reason to raise interest rates now  Mr Visco said there were risks to the global recovery including concerns over equity prices and corporate earnings the high levels of household debt in many countries and the huge and growing current account deficit But he played down the possible impact of the most immediate threat a rise in oil prices The OECD's model suggests that if oil prices average $35 a barrel over the next 18 months rather than its central assumption of $25 growth in the US will be just 0 2 percentage points lower The OECD's assessment of the economic effects of the September 11 attacks was that they were not negligible but not large Mr Visco said Developing economies seemed to have been the most affected The United Nations also yesterday revised upward its predictions for world growth estimating that global gross domestic product would grow by 1 8 per cent in 2002 and 3 2 per cent in 2003 up from 1 4 per cent in 2001 It forecast developing countries' growth rates at 3 5 in 2002 and 4 9 per cent 2003 compared with 2 4 per cent in 2001 Developing economies are not likely to benefit from the US-led recovery until the second half of 2002 hampering efforts to reduce world poverty UN economists said ,2
2002-06-06, Bad year for Swiss banks The amount of money managed by Swiss banks the world leaders in servicing the offshore banking needs of wealthy individuals fell 8 5 per cent to SFr3400bn {XEU}2320bn $2110bn £1445bn last year according to the Swiss National Bank Some 55 9 per cent of the money is managed for foreign individuals and the decline primarily reflected the weakness of world equity markets However the fall in assets under management combined with a 15 per cent drop in commission income and a 29 per cent drop in trading profits meant that 2001 was the worst year for Swiss banks since 1996 The figures suggest that UBS and Credit Suisse the country's two biggest banks have been more successful than the smaller banks in defending their private banking market share William Hall Zurich,2

2002-06-20, France Telecom yesterday reached an agreement with 17 banks on the restructuring of MobilCom's debt paving the way for the French telecommunications group to take over its German partner People familiar with the agreement said it would allow Orange France Telecom's subsidiary shortly to launch an all-paper offer of around {XEU}10 per share for the 71 5 per cent in MobilCom it does not own valuing the German mobile operator at {XEU}652 87m $624m After weeks of brinkmanship on all sides MobilCom's lending banks have agreed to swap their {XEU}4 7bn loan to MobilCom for a security convertible into France Telecom shares This will cover 90 per cent of the loan {XEU}4 2bn and have a strike price of at least {XEU}45 France Telecom shares closed down 8 per cent yesterday at {XEU}15 a huge discount to the convertible's strike price While the banks including Merrill Lynch Deutsche Bank ABN Amro and Societe Generale may eventually have to write off a large proportion of their loans as a result of the agreement the threat of an imminent MobilCom insolvency is now lifted Because the security is perpetual in maturity and has a deferred coupon payment the French group expects ratings agencies will consider it as hybrid equity and view the structure as equivalent to a deferred rights issue The transaction is structured to allow France Telecom to take over MobilCom which has total debts of {XEU}6bn-7bn without being forced to consolidate the German group's debt to its {XEU}60 7bn debt pile Meanwhile the conversion price for the security will ensure that only 19m France Telecom new shares are issued on conversion This will dilute the French state's 55 per cent stake in the operator which must remain above 50 per cent by law to 51 per cent Yesterday's deal however is conditional on the re-negotiation by France Telecom of another {XEU}2 1bn in MobilCom liabilities in the form of vendor facilities granted by Nokia and Ericsson the telecom equipment manufacturers to the German operator The debt restructuring deal with the banks will also become void if Orange does not secure the 49 per cent stake in MobilCom held by Gerhard Schmid its founder and chief executive While Orange's offer would represent a 20 per cent premium over MobilCom's share price of {XEU}8 30 in late trading yesterday it is far below the {XEU}17 to {XEU}18 per-share people close to Mr Schmid have said he would accept Mr Schmid who has been locked in a bitter dispute with France Telecom said in March he would resign if the French group bought him out for {XEU}22 per share But his position was later undermined by revelations that he had violated German securities law by paying his wife a fee for using her shares to underpin a stock option programme without informing his financial director or drawing a written contract France Telecom is expected to insist that Mr Schmid repay {XEU}68m related to the illegal transaction www ft com/telecoms,1
2002-04-22, Graduates will leave university this year with debts of £10000 up nearly £7000 on 1999 according to a survey published today This year's college leavers are the first to feel the full impact of tuition fees the abolition of grants and the borrowing available through cheap student loans The average debt forecast represents the first estimate of the burden students will take into their first job if the system remains unchanged The survey by NatWest the bank comes as the government prepares to announce changes to student support in this summer's spending review for 2003-06 The prime minister has ordered changes after encountering anger over the present system introduced in 1997 during canvassing for last year's general election The survey provides some support for the government's view that debt does not deter applications to colleges Starting salaries in London and East Anglia were found to be between £20000 and £25000 against an average of £13422 While monthly repayments of student debts are set to be about £200 more than nine out of 10 said they had never considered dropping out of higher education Ministers are unlikely to reintroduce grants or abolish fees but are expected to improve payments to the least well-off students The survey which spoke to about 1000 undergraduates also provides evidence that students are getting used to the new system Only 25 per cent of graduates in 2002 thought about not going to university because of tuition fees That figure compares with more than half in 2001 For the majority university is still seen as a worthwhile investment and nine out of 10 graduates in this year's survey are adamant that debt did not put them off finishing their course said Ann Marie Blake head of NatWest student and graduate banking About 45 per cent of students said they would prefer to stay with the current system of cheap loans rather than introducing a radical change for example a new graduate tax system However the government is considering charging commercial rates on such loans ,2

1998-04-01, The Sabanci family one of Turkey's leading business dynasties has raised $123m through the sale to international investors of a 3 5 per cent stake in the family-controlled Akbank The shares in the form of ADSs were sold to mainly UK and US institutions according to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter global co-ordinator of the issue The sale is the first of several Turkish bank offerings expected this year The government is planning to sell a stake in Isbank in the next few months that could raise up to $800m Each ADS represents 200 ordinary Akbank shares and was priced at $14 or TL17000 an ordinary share This is a discount of just over 4 per cent on the closing price of the shares on Monday Morgan Stanley said An over-allotment of 15 per cent of the size of the deal may also be exercised At the selling price Akbank has a market capitalisation of $3 5bn and is the largest bank in Turkey in terms of equity capital The sale reduces the Sabanci family's stake in Akbank to about 44 per cent and increases the free float in the bank's share capital to 19 per cent  Solidere the Lebanese company rebuilding Beirut's business district is contemplating a second issue of global depositary receipts according to bankers The offering likely to be launched in coming weeks would be priced at $14 to $15 a GDR and raise roughly $100m In 1996 the company issued $77m of GDRs which are currently trading in a $14 to $14 50 range ,2
2002-06-21, Goldman Sachs added to Wall Street's gloom yesterday by revealing it had cut 10 per cent of its workforce since last year and acknowledging that its backlog of deals had declined The investment bank also reported a fall in profits to $563m in the three months to May a drop of 2 per cent compared with last year or nearly 37 per cent from its bull-market peak in 2000 Goldman was cautious about the prospects for mergers and acquisition work saying the crisis of confidence that followed Enron's collapse was keeping executives from pulling the trigger on deals When you look at CEOs there is a very big inward focus said David Viniar Goldman's chief financial officer They are much more focused on making sure their house is clean  On the brighter side Goldman's earnings were 7 per cent higher than in the first quarter when it suffered a large loss trying to sell a block of shares in a company analysts have identified as Vivendi the French media and utilities group Goldman did particularly well last quarter trading debt It reported $1 14bn in revenues from what it calls FICC fixed income currencies and commodities up 21 per cent from last year Goldman managed the gains despite a fall in commodities revenues Investment banking revenues were $762m down 4 per cent from last year Advisory revenues rose 33 per cent to $428m Underwriting income fell 29 per cent to $334m Goldman also booked a $125m investment loss Mr Viniar said it suffered losses on holdings in telecoms and technology companies most of them private Mr Viniar said Goldman's overall backlog of investment banking work based on its estimates of revenues from deals in house declined slightly last quarter That indicated a drop in M&A because as Mr Viniar noted equity filings have been on the rise Goldman put its head count at 21145 a decline of 2349 jobs or 10 per cent of the total since August of last year Goldman cut 991 or 4 per cent of those jobs in its second quarter Mr Viniar indicated more job cuts could be made depending on the pace of activity on Wall Street Goldman's ratio of compensation expenses to revenues remained 50 per cent as in the previous quarter It cut non-compensation expenses by 11 per cent from last year ,2
2002-06-28, Harvey Pitt has struck back The SEC chairman filed a suit and delivered a harangue to corporate America within 24 hours of the first revelations that WorldCom had massively misled regulators He was at least in part moving quickly to stamp out criticism of his leadership that has been mounting on Capitol Hill in recent weeks Most of the lashings have come at the hands of Democrats who have repeatedly accused the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of moving too slowly on accounting fraud and reform and of being too close to audit firms and large corporations many of whom he represented as a private securities lawyer He is not doing the job in my opinion said Senator Tom Daschle the Democratic leader His cosy relationship with the industry is one that has been raised on many many occasions and whether or not he has the credibility to be the independent regulator he needs to be is up to him He needs to show his independence and his aggressiveness and to date he has not done so  More troubling for Mr Pitt is that some of the toughest criticism in the wake of the WorldCom debacle has come from his own party Well-respected Senator John McCain the top Republican on the powerful Commerce committee which has been investigating Enron's collapse angrily questioned Mr Pitt's handling of the wave of corporate scandals charging there was an absolute void at the top of the SEC With such criticism reaching boiling point in Washington Mr Pitt used his announcement of the lawsuit and his demand that the US's 1000 largest companies submit new certified statements attesting to the accuracy of their financial statements as an opportunity to hit back at his political critics I will not stoop to the level of those who seek to attack the diligent agency for political revenge he said at a news conference The system needs repair We are repairing it I have no interest in blaming anyone for the system I have inherited  Defenders of Mr Pitt said much of the criticism was ill-founded noting he has only been in his post for 10 months and had a sterling reputation as a meticulous and even-handed securities lawyer while in private practice They also note that as an attorney who worked closely with industry prior to joining the SEC he is unusually well positioned to take on the business community with the credibility needed to enact tough reforms The criticism of this chairman has been misplaced said Jacob Frenkel a former senior counsel in the SEC's enforcement division He has inherited an enforcement environment that must react to the excesses and abuses perpetrated under a regulatory scheme that was in place for years and decades before he became chairman  Indeed both Mr Pitt and officials in the Bush administration have attempted to put some blame on the Clinton presidency Mr Pitt himself has made the reference obliquely saying The problems we've inherited reflect the irrational exuberance of the 1990s and the longest sustained bull market in history  He also criticised the fair disclosure rules implemented by Arthur Levitt his Clinton-era predecessor regulations designed to stop analysts and institutions from being handed important corporate information before small investors Mr Pitt said the rules called Reg FD were a poor solution to a significant problem adding that while he had no intention of repealing them he would make them irrelevant by superimposing different regulations on disclosure Other members of the Bush administration have been more direct in their criticism of the policies of the previous administration Lawrence Lindsey President George W Bush's top White House economic adviser called the 1990s a time of financial excess The Bush administration's characterisation of the 1990s as a period of excess mirrors rhetoric used by then-Governor Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential campaign when he accused the Reagan and Bush administrations of governing over a decade of greed in the 1980s Mr Pitt has also partially blamed the agency's inability to keep up with the pace of scandal on a lack of resources at the SEC The General Accounting Office last month found that funding and personnel resources at the agency were so thin that it could only review 16 per cent of annual corporate filings last year or about half of its stated goal of 30-35 per cent Indeed Mr Pitt's trumpeting of the close ties the SEC has been forging with the Department of Justice and US attorney offices regional branches of the DoJ are in part born of necessity The SEC must lean on the DoJ since the agency simply cannot cope with the number of investigations it has running at the moment The SEC would not comment on the caseload of its enforcement division but people in Washington estimate that the agency has now opened at least 1800 investigations It closed one of those yesterday when it brought an action against a Dutch branch of auditor Ernst & Young The branch the SEC said had a consultancy relationship with a client Baan that impaired the independence of its audits The branch paid $400000 without admitting or denying wrongdoing Overseas ventures as well as the many hundreds at home are expensive for the SEC Mr Pitt has been promised more money and the House of Representatives this week approved by 422 to four a huge increase in the SEC's budget raising it from $438m to $776m The Bush administration had originally sought a much more modest increase to $467m but has indicated it will support the new funding The raise must still be approved by the Senate however and is not released until Congress passes separate appropriations bills In the interim Mr Pitt's team has focused on bringing in as much outside help as possible That includes making sure industry regulators such as the National Association of Securities Dealers take on their share of the burden Scarce resources has also meant a focus on big fish meaning inevitably that some wrongdoing minnows will get away Enforcement staff are trying to resolve the smallest 10 per cent of their cases as soon as possible people familiar with the agency said Mr Pitt insisted this week that no one is getting a pass but some cases have fallen low on the priority list ,3
2002-04-18, Senior company executives with large numbers of share options will be the biggest beneficiaries of the government's latest reform of capital gains tax experts said yesterday One expert also predicted that the reform could encourage efforts at tax avoidance The government's new capital gains tax regime provides for a 10 per cent rate on disposals of business assets held for two years The 10 per cent rate faced by higher rate taxpayers was originally set at 10 years although the government cut it to four years in 2000 Employees who own shares in their companies will be able to take advantage of the reform because the equities are treated as business assets Shares in unlisted companies are also classified as business assets The 10 per cent rate of capital gains tax on disposals of business assets held for two years looks attractive compared to the 40 per cent top rate of income tax Edward Troup head of tax strategy at Simmons and Simmons said Major beneficiaries of the 10 per cent rate are likely to be senior executives with share options  He said the reform could also encourage executives to seek to convert salaries or bonuses into shares that would be subject to capital gains tax rather than income tax Mr Troup who was an adviser to Kenneth Clarke the former Conservative chancellor said A rate as low as 10 per cent will inevitably encourage tax avoidance I am already seeing individuals arranging their affairs to convert remuneration into gains taxed at 10 per cent  He said the government's capital gains tax reforms lacked coherence and claimed the government could lose up to £2bn each year as a result of the latest change The government's June 2001 enterprise plan announced it would cut the rate of capital gains tax on disposals of business assets Mr Brown said yesterday From this year three-quarters of taxpayers with business assets will pay only a 10 per cent rate rewarding entrepreneurship and giving Britain overall a capital gains tax regime more favourable to enterprise than that of the US  David Ellis tax consultant at Ernst & Young also thought senior executives with share options would benefit from the 10 per cent rate To the extent people with large numbers of share options exercise them and acquire shares they stand to benefit significantly from the capital gains tax rules if they hold on to their shares he said Carol Atha tax partner at Deloitte & Touche suggested the capital gains tax reform could lead employers to provide more remuneration in shares In the future we may see a shift to remunerating people with shares rather than share options she said Non-business assets held by higher-rate taxpayers will continue to attract a 40 per cent rate of capital gains tax for two years which tapers to 25 per cent after 10 years Shares held in listed companies are treated as non-business assets unless the stake represents more than 5 per cent Ms Atha said Although the reform is welcome considerable complexity remains over the definition between business and non-business assets ,3

2002-06-12, Germany was supposed to be the new Promised Land of investment banking Here was a country with emerging market growth characteristics but with fewer risks As Vodafone launched its hostile bid for Mannesmann two years ago it seemed that deals littered the immaculate sidewalks of Frankfurt waiting to be swept up by eager investment bankers The reality has been much more prosaic Structural changes which should drive investment banking revenues pension reform tax reform and corporate governance changes have not gone away However some have been slower to come about than originally hoped and most importantly the deal-flow has been stymied by weak equity markets and economic uncertainty According to data from Boston Consulting Group equity capital markets activity by German issuers in the first quarter of 2002 was 23 7 per cent below the first quarter last year and 86 7 per cent below the first quarter of 2000 It was also 93 5 per cent lower than the peak in the second quarter of 2000 Then $21 7bn was raised $1 4bn was raised in the first three months of 2002 It is a similar picture in mergers and acquisitions The value of M&A transactions with a German acquirer or target in the first quarter of this year was 91 6 per cent below the peak in the second quarter of 2000 Then deals worth $239bn were done compared with $20bn in the first three months of 2002 This was also down 66 9 per cent on the first quarter of last year This is partly reflected in new data on the German buy-out market Europe's star player in 2000 but which had a dreadful year in 2001 Its value more than halved from {XEU}15 1bn to {XEU}7bn according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research What buy-out market asks Christoph Cleve of JP Morgan There are few large deals in the market Nobody in the leveraged finance market is really making the money they used to make and some are losing money bottom line  Ludger Kuebel-Sorger co-head of the investment banking practice at Boston Consulting Group says A lot of players built up in these markets and now they are in a situation where the investments do not pay off A lot have to readjust capacity  He adds that some banks have stopped investment programmes for example where they were building sales capacity research capacity or advisory capabilities and others have made deeper cuts Many claim they have not had substantial cuts because they are keeping their presence in Germany says Mr Kuebel-Sorger adding many are redirecting their investment towards areas with better prospects What you see is that people go into fixed income credit markets and push anything that is risk management products These are the areas where people still invest in product technology trading and in sales  There are exceptions Mr Kuebel-Sorger says some of the smaller middle-market advisory specialists claim to have reasonably strong deal- flows Research from Centre for Management Buy-Out Research found that despite the sharp drop in the value of buy-outs in Germany last year the number of deals rose by nearly 40 per cent Nevertheless the big deals the big international investment banks such as Goldman Sachs Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were banking on have been few and far between They remain a theoretical prospect According to Deutsche Bank more than 50 per cent of Germany's {XEU}1400bn equity market is held by banks insurance companies and other companies which are not natural holders of such shareholdings When those owners start shedding assets a handful of companies are expected to change hands during the next few years Allianz the Munich-based insurer is expected to pull the strings behind many German mergers and acquisitions Its portfolio of investments in German companies is one of the largest A taste of what many hope is to come was offered by Allianz last year When it bought Dresdner Bank it took advantage of reforms which abolished the capital gains tax publicly listed companies paid for selling stakes in other companies Though the Munich-based insurer took control of Dresdner before the changes had taken effect it used complex financial instruments to ensure it did not pay capital gains tax Although successful Allianz's third attempt to do a deal with Dresdner is a reminder of how difficult deals in Germany can be Others may also prove tricky Beiersdorf which makes Nivea skin cream has two big shareholders Allianz and the Herz family The Herz family is widely thought to want to increase its stake in Beiersdorf by using the money it raised from selling Reemtsma the tobacco company Yet people close to the family say they could decide to sell instead if the price is too high Allianz has asked Goldman Sachs to help to sell its stake While there is a line of US personal care companies interested in buying Beiersdorf the two large shareholders make it difficult for either to sell Another Allianz investment MAN the industrial conglomerate with a large truck operation has also proved difficult to exit Analysts strongly suspect it would sell its 18 per cent stake if the right opportunity arose But a buyer for the truck business would probably not be interested in MAN's printing machine operations And yet the tax reforms which should facilitate these sort of restructurings could be reversed before its advantages have been fully exploited Some politicians are pushing for this to help to tackle the growing federal deficit Estimates of how long the window will stay open range from many months to about two years Mr Cleve of JP Morgan says The financial sponsors are quite optimistic They are working on lots of things the question is when are these things coming to the market It was a pretty bad first half but the prospects are a lot brighter than what is behind us  Mr Kuebel-Sorger of BCG adds The most important thing is that stock markets do recover ,2

2002-06-27, Gordon Brown promised there was no hidden agenda in his approach to the euro in last night's Mansion House speech But that will not stop people trying to find one There were warm words about Europe Britain's future for a pro-European like me is at the centre of Europe not isolated on its fringes Mr Brown said He was explicit too about the potential benefits of euro entry More competitive prices for consumers and business expanding trade the lowest possible long-term interest rates and sustained high growth and employment would indeed be a prize to be valued  But his lengthy discussion of the Treasury's assessment which took up much of the second half of his speech emphasised his leading role in the decision and raised plenty of potential obstacles He stressed the seriousness with which the Treasury was taking the assessment for which the preliminary and technical work had already begun The work under way will ensure that the assessment will be the most robust rigorous and comprehensive work the Treasury has ever done and there will be no fudging or short-circuiting as we measure the effect of the euro on employment growth investment and stability he said And his description of what that work entailed made it clear that the next assessment due within the next 11 months or so would be very different from the 40-page document hurriedly produced for Labour's first assessment of euro entry in October 1997 He promised a stack of supporting studies to back up the case made in the assessment seeming to suggest there could be as many as 10 covering issues such as influences on the location of financial services businesses and the lessons from the experience of the US as a monetary union One study likely to attract particular interest will cover the suitable exchange rate for the pound at entry Academic studies such as the work by Simon Wren Lewis of Exeter University who is now advising the Treasury have suggested that a sustainable rate for the pound would be some way below its current level even after its recent falls Other issues addressed will include the housing market and its effect on consumer spending and the effect of euro entry on different business sectors as well as the obvious measures of economic cycles and interest rates The team of economists working full-time on the assessment numbers only about 10 Although they draw in expertise from elsewhere in the Treasury to work on specific topics and officials have been working on these questions for years Mr Brown's depiction of such a mammoth task does not suggest it will be easy to deliver the results of the assessment in a hurry The rest of Mr Brown's speech focused on the forthcoming public spending review which he said would focus on supporting the drivers of productivity growth improving competition science investment enterprise and skills He promised to take seriously the case for further housing development to radically revamp rules and resources to speed up planning decisions and to expand work permits for skilled immigrants On the economic outlook Mr Brown repeated his position of cautious optimism saying there were in the US and in the euro area generally signs of renewed growth And as in his Financial Times interview on Tuesday He gave a strong signal that he expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates soon With strengthening global recovery and domestic consumer demand already strong against a background of historically low interest rates the Bank of England will of course have tough choices to make in the coming months to ensure sustainable growth and the maintenance of stability he said It was by prompt and early action that in the past our monetary authority has avoided the risks of stop-go instability and we will as we have always done since 1997 back the Bank of England in the difficult decisions they have to make ,3
2002-04-10, Europe's parliament is in denial At last month's session in its grand headquarters in Strasbourg the European Union's only directly elected institution discussed such momentous issues as violence on the West Bank vote rigging in Zimbabwe and globalisation These are all issues over which the European parliament has precisely no power Other business did take up some of its time including one subject on which the key legislator involved was permitted to speak for a mere 2{1/2} minutes This was the matter of liberalising Europe's {XEU}250bn £154bn electricity and gas markets an issue over which the parliament has very considerable sway The imbalance sums up the dilemma of the European parliament It is a significant though not quite equal partner with EU governments in the business of deciding European legislation yet this crucial role is often obscured by its focus on more grandiose affairs outside its control Much of its influence is wielded by specific members of the European parliament known as rapporteurs who guide legislation through They work on bills that proceed through committee suggest amendments as a part of their report which serves as a template for the final important vote of the full parliament or plenary The plenary can decide to accept change or reject the rapporteur's proposals but it is rare that they are dismissed out of hand Even though Claude Turmes the rapporteur for the energy measure did not get all the time he wanted to address the plenary he still left his mark on the first provisional reading of the directive winning support for new controls on the use of billions of euros put aside for nuclear decommissioning In spite of opposition from the European Commission the EU's executive body which drafts all legislation his measure will eventually govern all 15 EU member states It is hard to see where else a ponytailed Luxembourg Green such as Mr Turmes could exercise such influence and easy to understand why lobbyists flock round parliament and the rapporteurs Indeed rapporteur is even the name of a magazine aimed at the parliament which comes complete with advertisements placed by business lobbyists and pressure groups telling readers which way to vote on key legislation But for all its powers the parliament is not a place of great personalities coalitions for government or resounding popular mandates Issues such as energy liberalisation a prospectus directive or postal reform are not the sort of hot topics that get people out to vote though such issues matter enormously to business MEPs know that not many from their ranks are likely to be re-elected on their record of tabling technical amendments to such measures Instead they stand and fall as candidates on local and national issues on which they have no say hospital closures the state of the economy or the fight against global injustice There is a real disconnect between the extent of power MEPs have as legislators and their lack of visibility as politicians says Nick Clegg a British Liberal Democrat MEP Legislatively MEPs wield a big stick but are not really accountable It is really the inverse of national parliaments where people can often be impotent and prominent at the same time  The European parliament's identity crisis also stems from misinterpretation of what the EU itself is Even as it heads towards completing its first half century the EU is still often seen as an organisation of far-reaching ambitions that is largely dominated by the European Commission In fact the EU is primarily concerned with technical and economic affairs and a few incursions into second order foreign policy issues and the Commission's power to push through proposals into law is limited in the extreme Overstating the scope of the EU's role can lead to disappointment about parliament's own limited terrain Conversely exaggerating the importance of the Commission can detract from MEPs' place in helping decide what rules should apply throughout the EU The work they do is certainly voluminous When the full parliament meets as it does in Strasbourg once a month hundreds of boxes arrive from the permanent headquarters in Brussels on the Friday before the session begins A week later they are all sent back The meat of the session itself is on the Tuesday and Wednesday with Monday and Thursday usually dedicated to less pressing issues On the busiest days a bewildering variety of subjects is crammed into a few hours of debate although typically the vote comes the day after the debate Under such circumstances it is understandable that the full vote often does little more than endorse the earlier findings of the committee that has previously debated the issue Yet these are momentous issues The Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties agreed by EU countries in the 1990s gave parliament extensive co-decision powers In all areas of legislation governing market reform or the single market parliament has to give its approval and can amend legislation Typically parliament subjects a commission proposal to a first reading in which first the relevant committee and then the plenary air their views The measure then goes to EU ministers before returning to parliament for a second and definitive reading If parliament and member states are still deeply at odds then the legislation proceeds to a conciliation committee made up of 15 MEPs and 15 deputy ambassadors from the member states which then subjects its findings to an extraordinary final reading If this fails to give its approval then the measure falls as did the EU's long gestated takeover directive which would have set out common rules for mergers and acquisitions in the EU The problem is that parliament often comes off second best in such confrontations because it is too keen on seeing the legislation get passed Parliament is less nationalist and more European-minded than the member states says Carlos Westendorp a Socialist former Spanish foreign minister and currently chairman of the parliament's giant industry trade and energy committee Often MEPs want legislation to go through and the member states don't really mind and that gives them the advantage  In addition parliament is not made of coherent political blocs on issues such as energy liberalisation and the takeover directive MEPs have voted on national rather than party political lines As a consequence the overall balance in parliament the centre-right European People's party has 233 seats of 626 is rather less important than it otherwise would be That is a great advantage says Markus Ferber a German Christian Democrat who was rapporteur on recent legislation to liberalise postal markets In national parliaments where you have government and opposition people do not speak about the issues they concentrate on getting power or keeping hold of it We concentrate on solving problems rather than helping a party survive My job on the postal directive was to find a solution That is what we did  Such is the elusive nature of the institution Rarely decisive barely coherent and often overruled parliament nevertheless plays a key role in legislation that can make the difference between profit and loss for thousands of companies Because of the labyrinthine workings of the whole individual MEPs can often exercise surprising influence It is an uneasy balance In the future parliament may acquire more prominence and a more political role But at present it is already far too important to be ignored Previous articles in this series appeared on March

2002-06-17, Fears are growing in the business community that a six-month political deadlock in Trinidad and Tobago could stir up racial conflict There are now strong indications that the political paralysis is taking on racial tones and this is a route that this country must not go down said one of the Caribbean state's leading bankers Already responsible people are talking about racial division leading to violence The politicians must resolve this crisis sooner rather than later  The crisis has left Trinidad with no sitting parliament six months after a general election ended in a tie The leading political parties draw their support from the two main racial groups in the gas-rich country of 13m people Basdeo Panday a former prime minister leads the opposition United National Congress which draws most of its support from descendants of immigrants from the Asian subcontinent He objected to the decision by President Arthur Robinson to name as prime minister Patrick Manning whose People's National Movement is supported in the main by Afro-Trinidadians Mr Manning says new elections will be held but has not set a date Mr Manning's government has been changing the boards of state-owned companies and replacing employees hired by the former government Ganga Singh an opposition MP accused the government of ethnic cleansing Mr Manning has denied it Six years ago when the UNC was putting people in office they described it as replacing PNM supporters with their own' be said Now that things are happening in another direction we are being told that Indians are being taken out and Africans put in  The political paralysis could lead to increased racial polarisation that could turn violent suggested a diplomat in the capital Port of Spain The impasse is also affecting the traditionally robust economy According to government officials and business leaders expansion is continuing but there are concerns about sustained growth The uncertainty is not good for the country said David O'Brien president of the chamber of industry and commerce We are awaiting a kick-start  Bruce Aanensen president of RBTT a financial services conglomerate said It is a question of getting the government business sorted out and the country will move forward  The international energy industry has invested about $5bn L3 4bn in the past five years making the country a big player in the liquefied natural gas market and a leading exporter of nitrogenous fertilisers Investments of another $3bn are planned over the next four years but investors are worried We had hoped that the political crisis already would have been resolved said a senior executive of a gas industry company We are ready to proceed but if there is no functioning parliament to approve agreements then we cannot commit to any projects The longer this goes on the more unattractive the country will get  Ronald Ramkissoon president of the Economists' Association of Trinidad and Tobago said revenues from oil and gas over the next five years would be between $8bn and $10bn The country's budget this year is $2 4bn Mr Manning told a recent party meeting that preparations should be made for elections He appears however to be seeking an easier solution It is possible that seating allocations could become the subject of some dynamism he said suggesting that an opposition MP could join his party creating a majority that would allow parliament to convene ,3
2002-06-14, Remy Cointreau Remy Cointreau's strong recovery from near-bankruptcy was checked last year by a decline in duty free sales after September 11 But it has confirmed its reputation for caution and an 11 6 per cent rise in 2002 net profit was ahead of its revised forecast of a 5-10 per cent increase Like-for-like operating profit rose 3 8 per cent Remy continues to repair its balance sheet reducing its debt-to-equity ratio from 82 to 75 per cent Champagne still struggles but that is an irrelevance The Americans remain enthusiastic drinkers of Remy's core cognac brands US cognac sales rose 12 per cent helping the division to an impressive margin pre-distribution costs of 38 4 per cent Bols the Dutch spirits group acquired in 2000 has made a surprisingly strong contribution Its vodka is selling well in Poland but doubts remain whether its other brands can be marketed to appeal to the younger more international set Longer term France's second largest drinks group faces a tough struggle in a market dominated by bigger players such as Diageo This helps explain Remy's small discount on an enterprise value to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation multiple of just under 9 to the likes of its closer rivals Allied Domecq and Pernod Ricard The large family shareholding removes a bid premium from the calculation but the management has performed well through a difficult time Remy's discount to the European drinks sector should narrow ,2
1998-04-03, Nationwide is facing a second campaign by Michael Hardern a former royal butler to force the UK's biggest building society to convert to a bank Mr Hardern self-styled carpetbagger-in-chief said he would present nomination papers for election to the board today one day ahead of the deadline Last year his high profile campaign was resoundingly defeated by Nationwide but it proved highly disruptive because it sparked a wave of carpetbagging by speculators seeking windfalls Observers said Nationwide would want to at least repeat the three-to-one margin of victory it achieved last year They warned that a narrower victory could weaken the organisation's commitment to mutuality and possibly tempt a predator Assuming his papers are valid Mr Hardern will be one of two outside candidates contesting the elections The other is Andy Muir a company managing director from Windsor Mr Hardern said Frankly I don't think I stand a chance against the organisation but members should have another opportunity to vote for conversion He said bank shares had risen 50 per cent since last year so Nationwide's 4 5m qualifying members could hope for windfalls of more than £1500 each if his campaign succeeded He insisted he would take a more consistent line than last year when he appeared to change his mind about conversion halfway through the campaign Nationwide has ensured there will no repeat of last year's surge of speculative activity because new members are made to assign any windfall benefits to charity A number of carpetbaggers will be eligible to vote this year for the first time But Nationwide believes they will be counterbalanced by support from borrowers who will also have voting rights for the first time because of its competitive mortgage rates We are disappointed Mr Hardern is standing again because members made it clear last year that they want us to remain a building society But it is his democratic right to do so the society said The postal ballot will take place in July with the result due to be announced on or before July 23 when the annual meeting is scheduled ,3
2002-06-08, McBride the leading European manufacturer of branded household and personal care goods yesterday sounded a rare note of optimism about trading conditions The group which last year saw profit margins deteriorate also said it had agreed to buy out Nichol Beauty Products its partner in a joint venture called Aerosol Products Limited In a statement McBride said that profits and cash flow in the second half had been ahead of the first The group currently sees opportunities to maintain sales progress and margins as well as cash generation it said McBride's financial year ends on June 30 The agreement with Nichol is designed to allow McBride to transfer shares in the heavily indebted aerosol company to its lenders in exchange for the elimination of its debts Under the terms of the deal McBride's UK subsidiary will pay £12m in cash to acquire the 50 per cent of APL that it does not already own McBride's current 50 per cent stake will be transferred to the Royal Bank of Scotland and Credit Agricole Indosuez APL's main lenders for a nominal sum The banks will then convert £11m of APL's bank debt into preference shares This move is intended to clear the aerosol group's balance sheet of debt McBride will also subscribe for £4m worth of preferred shares in APL and write off £16m of goodwill in the company Mike Handley chief executive of McBride said the deal put APL on a firm financial footing and removed the uncertainty about the future of the joint venture We can now concentrate on maintaining the development of our core household and personal care businesses in the UK continental Europe and Poland  But the announcement had little effect on McBride's share price The group which has seen its shares slide since late 1998 closed up 1p at 56{1/2}p APL has been hit by increased competition in the aerosol market While McBride and Nichol moved to stem the effect on the company's finances announcing a restructuring including job cuts last June they were not able to bring it into profitability In the year ended June 2001 APL's net losses were £11 3m ,2

2002-06-07, It has taken Mexican companies a long time to change their attitude to risk management since the peso crisis of 1994-5 That crisis resulted largely from irresponsible and unhedged speculation by Mexican banks which made large bets on the peso retaining its overvalued exchange rate against the dollar But it is only in the last few months that the country has produced an efficient and liquid market in the derivatives needed to manage those risks effectively In 2000 five years after the crisis and with the economy growing strongly total contract volume traded on MexDer Mexico's derivative market was still only a pitiful 1 42m The market failed to arouse any more enthusiasm in the first half of 2001 But January 2002 alone broke all records with 5 88m contracts traded By April monthly volume was up to 6 31m First-quarter volume was 24 per cent higher than for the whole of 2001 The sudden explosion of activity followed reforms to the system implemented in May last year after exhaustive talks between MexDer the banks and traders First structural changes were introduced which reduced bureaucracy and sped up the application process for institutions that wished to take part Marketmakers were introduced to help run the main instruments while the task of running the clearing house was given to leading banks The stock exchange introduced much-needed liquidity From there the market was left to run its course The Fitch rating agency granted MexDer a triple-A grade in February on the back of its apparent leap in efficiency All of this action seems a little late In the 1994 crisis interest rates soared from 10 to 100 per cent in a matter of days More than 50 per cent of the banking sector's loans had to be written off and the devastated banking sector survived only thanks to an international loan The loan today is still worth 11 67 per cent of the country's entire GDP Banks currently hold over 80 per cent of MexDer volume as bankers have leapt at the chance to buffer the banks against any repeat of 1994 But the market's growth will be as significant for the business owners as the banks As corporate Mexico has become more integrated with the US it has found itself in greater need of covering its financial risks MexDer appears to be one of the main means to do this Before it was just too expensive for an export company to cover its exchange rate risks through the Chicago or European derivative markets for example says Nathaniel Karp director of financial and banking systems for Bancomer the Mexican bank now owned by Citigroup of the US Because of this such instruments were never considered and so the risk was always present or simply never taken  Businesses have been reluctant to enter into higher-risk activities but analysts are optimistic that now the market is more accessible and is slowly becoming more understood companies will become more involved Big players have always used instruments through the US markets but it is managing risk in Mexico at a small and medium company level that is important here says Guillermo Camou sub-director of derivative product management for the bank ScotiabankInverlat Use of US markets remains only within the reach of big players Mr Camou says that cultural factors such as the absence of English-speaking accountants in many medium-sized companies keep them out of the market Jorge Alegria Formoso MexDer's new chief executive is bullish He predicts exponential growth over the next couple of years fuelled by the development of a risk culture in Mexico for banks as much as small companies and by an expansion in MexDer's portfolio Instrument variety remains limited with interest rate futures accounting for 99 87 per cent of volume There are also futures for currency trading the IPC the benchmark index of the Mexico City stock exchange and for individual stocks Mr Alegria says that expansion of all these markets is vital and he also wants to see the market move into longer-maturity government debt futures He admits that growth will be in stages The introduction by July of additional market-makers for the IPC and the new exchange reference rate Naftrac based on US Trackers and dollar futures will lead to equivalent growth Three-year government bond futures will be added by September and by next year MexDer hopes to see the creation of dollar and IPC options The menu is being written and a substantial plate is already on the table Now it's just a case of the traders taking a seat Mr Alegria says With Mexico's interest rates at historically low levels investors need to look beyond government treasury bills Gradually loosening restrictions on pension funds in a bill currently before Congress would allow these players to use derivatives in a few strictly defined situations If Mr Alegria can succeed in persuading such investors into his market he could open up new opportunities for Mexico's beleaguered small and medium-sized companies ,2
2002-06-07, Heavy exceptional charges relating to restructuring and disposals pushed Express Dairies into losses in the year to March but the company said the new financial year had started better Neil Davidson chief executive said Express aimed to resume dividend payments as soon as possible perhaps with the interim results in November The group's home delivery business which has a contract with Parcelforce and is applying for a licence to deliver business packets from its fleet of milk floats was making a profit that should increase significantly this year Sir Richard Packer former permanent secretary at the since-renamed Ministry of Agriculture was joining as a non-executive director in August Mr Davidson said that results for last year had been better than feared at the interim stage and the shares rose 2{1/4}p to 28{3/4}p Profit margins in the milk business had been squeezed by higher prices paid to farmers and competition in selling to supermarkets With 25 per cent overcapacity the industry is inherently unstable and unpredictable Mr Davidson said An industry deal is inevitable to take capacity out  He said Express which this year had brief but inconclusive talks with Arla the Scandinavian group was not in talks with any other groups We can't hang around waiting for that to happen he added saying Express had closed a number of plants and sold others This had contributed to £9m of cost savings Further savings of £7m in the current year would be offset by higher insurance and pension costs Profits before exceptionals goodwill amortisation and discontinued operations fell from £41 9m to £25 3m On that basis earnings per share were 5 8p 10 3p Exceptional charges totalled £30 9m £22 4m giving a pre-tax loss of £10 1m profit £15 6m Comment  At last life at Express seems a little more cheerful But there is still a long way to go The business is highly geared both financially and operationally More cash should be raised with rumours of a deal currently being negotiated with Milk Link the producer group And there is a general sense that the group is cosying up to farmers as they move into processing again Whether that ever turns into a full-blown bid is mere speculation But on same again pre-exceptional profit forecasts the price/earnings multiple is a lowly 4{1/2} ,2

2002-06-14, Yell the telephone directories business sold by BT Group last year yesterday paved the way for the UK's largest flotation this year by setting an indicative price range for its initial public offering The company is launching a global institutional offer with a price range of 270p to 345p a share valuing its equity at between £1 8bn and £2 3bn That is a considerable discount to the company's original hopes of a valuation of up to £2 8bn People close to the transaction said publication of the price range was delayed by about three days because Yell's owners the private equity houses Apax Partners and Hicks Muse Tate & Furst could not agree the final range Following the flotation Apax and Hicks Muse will together own 44 per cent of Yell shares with six month lock-ins John Condron chief executive will hold 0 77 per cent of the shares while John Davis finance director will receive 0 32 per cent The IPO makes them overnight millionaires with stakes worth an estimated £15 4m and £6 4m respectively In addition 5500 employees will each receive shares worth a minimum of £900 However some fund managers said Yell was asking investors to pay a relatively full price for the company's growth prospects in the US which they said remained uncertain It would be a mistake to try to present this as a growth company said one fund manager It is probably quite a safe cash- generative company but investors are likely to be quite sceptical if a high-growth spin is put on it  Yell's announcement comes as bankers are trying to get several up-and-coming flotations started as soon as possible The price range of Focus Wickes the DIY retailer which had been expected at the end of the month is expected to be set on Monday as is that of Cantrell & Cochrane the Irish drinks group Burberry the luxury goods company is set to publish a pathfinder prospectus on June 24 William Hill which is believed to be more than five times subscribed is expected to be priced this evening at the top of the indicative 190p-240p range At the midpoint of 215p the flotation would value Britain's second biggest bookmaker at £922m Yell said it would raise up to £1 05bn in its global institutional offer comprising a primary offer of £750m and a secondary offer of £300m The company said it would convert about £650m of bond debt to equity and use net proceeds of £717m from the primary offer to reduce its debt burden from about £2 5bn to £1 2bn However it is expected to seek further debt-backed acquisitions in the US Lex Page 20 Tough call Page 22 London stocks Page 48 www ft com/telecoms,1
2002-06-12, The technology media and telecoms block was in the ascendancy yesterday as investors decided after an early hesitation that Nokia's mid-quarter trading statement spelt good news Nokia made some large downward revisions to its outlook It said sales in the current quarter would be up to 6 per cent less than last year rather than their previous forecast that they would grow by up to 7 per cent On networks which represent about 30 per cent of its business it said sales would be down as much as 20-25 per cent compared with the second quarter of last year The previous target had been a fall of just 5 per cent to 10 per cent However the bad news had already been expected and the share price which has halved this year was already reflecting it After an initial dip of 9 per cent the shares turned upwards to close 3 6 per cent higher at {XEU}13 79 The good news was that Nokia stuck by its earnings per share target of 18-20 cents compared with 17 cents last year again as expected The downbeat forecast on networks hit its rival Ericsson much harder The Swedish company is more dependent than Nokia on this sector About 70 per cent of its revenues come from supplying network equipment compared with about 30 per cent for Nokia Ericsson's shares fell 5 6 per cent to SKr18 40 the worst performing blue chip in Europe Alcatel the French telecoms equipment maker rose 1 5 per cent to {XEU}11 04 while Europe's two leading chipmakers were modestly higher Infineon rose 1 per cent to {XEU}17 and STMicroelectronics rose 0 5 per cent to {XEU}25 20 But ASML the chip equipment maker was off 1 4 per cent to {XEU}17 90 Its shares are being weighed down by sliding chip prices which threaten to erode the spending power of ASML's customers Philips rises Electronics group Philips rose 4 2 per cent to {XEU}30 27 The share price was supported by news on Philips' co-operation in the development of new technology with other companies including Arm Holdings of the UK The telecoms sector benefited from the better sentiment triggered by Nokia As a whole it was up more than 3 per cent with Deutsche Telekom adding 5 8 per cent to {XEU}10 80 and France Telecom rising 8 3 per cent to {XEU}18 85 However the smaller German mobile operator MobilCom in which France Telecom has a 28 5 per cent stake fell by almost half to {XEU}7 29 on worries that France Telecom wanted to get rid of its stake France Telecom and its mobile arm Orange said they had terminated a co-operation agreement with MobilCom Fiat accelerated as the CEO's resignation and news that Standard & Poor's had reaffirmed the Italian motor group's debt rating Regular world stock markets updates at www ft com/markets raised hopes of a turnround at the troubled company The shares jumped 6 1 per cent to {XEU}13 69 Late on Monday Fiat said Mr Canterella was quitting after six years as chief executive and 25 years with the company His role would be taken by Paolo Fresco chairman of the group since 1998 The resignation fuelled speculation that Fiat may sell the remaining part of its loss-making car unit to General Motors before 2004 the date set in an agreement forged in 2000 when Fiat sold 20 per cent of Fiat Auto to GM Gregory Melich at Morgan Stanley said investors hoping for faster industrial and financial restructuring and the divestiture of underperforming assets could be in for positive surprises But he cautioned We remain concerned that Fiat's stock price discounts that it can sell many of its assets at good prices and still not justify further upside potential from current levels  Among the other motor companies Renault jumped 5 per cent to {XEU}52 50 after Lehman Brothers raised its price target to {XEU}62 from {XEU}52 Standard & Poor's also raised its ratings on the French

2002-06-13, Tyco International's troubles eased slightly yesterday when the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the way for the troubled conglomerate to launch an initial public offering of its CIT financial services unit After weeks of deliberation the SEC approved the prospectus for CIT's IPO after Tyco agreed to take a $4 5bn charge against its past earnings to reflect the sharp drop in the value of its financial subsidiary The clearance from the SEC allows CIT to start drumming up support from investors for the IPO Tyco will use the proceeds from the offering to pay off some of its heavy debt load and ease concerns of a cash crunch at the scandal-hit industrial group Despite the approval Moody's yesterday cut Tyco's credit rating to junk arguing that the widening array of management and corporate governance issues at the company outweighed the benefits of the debt reduction Yet shareholders who had previously pushed Tyco's shares to a new six-year low reacted with relief at news of the SEC clearance In after-market trading Tyco shares traded as high as $12 96 compared to their closing price of $10 15 Tyco's market value has slumped since the beginning of last week when chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski resigned a day before being indicted on charges of tax evasion Investigators are now examining whether Tyco properly disclosed a number of property deals made on behalf of senior executives Last night Tyco confirmed that the SEC is to launch a formal investigation ,2
2002-06-24, So much for the Franco-British love-in at the Seville summit Tony Blair the pundits reckon often gets on better with centre-right leaders than with his soi-disant comrades on the left The re-election of president Jacques Chirac backed by a government of conservatives opened up the prospect of Franco-British entente on issues from asylum seekers to economic reform At last said UK officials we should be able to do business with France Except Chirac refused to play ball First he blocked Blair's pet plan to get tough with non-EU countries that refuse to help crack down on illegal immigration The president said he was against penalising poor countries the real reason is that he did not want to upset trading relations with former colonies such as Algeria and Morocco Then Chirac blocked proposals by Blair and Germany's Gerhard Schroder for an extension of qualified majority voting at future EU summits which could have been used to force France to open up its energy markets It does not take the EU further forward said a French official Incidentally there was a time in the not too distant John Majorish past that Britain fought stoutly against any increase in majority voting Now Britain and Germany are united on the issue with not a peep from the Conservatives leaving the French to defend the national veto How times change ,3
2002-06-13, The Treasury which is making performance targets the benchmarks for deciding how to share out the cash in the current spending round has missed its own objective for cost savings because it has been unable to work out how to measure its output With the spending round set to conclude in about a month government departments are publishing their annual reports setting out performance against targets set in past spending reviews Gordon Brown repeated in a speech on Monday his insistence that resources must be tied to results But the Treasury's annual report published this week shows its target of 2 5 per cent annual efficiency gains and 2 5 per cent real-terms savings in running costs each year is ongoing in other words not met The reason given for the failure is It has not proved possible to measure aggregate Treasury output  The report does however say there have been efficiency improvements in many parts of the department's running costs budget It shows that the total net administration costs of the central Treasury activities are expected to be £87m this year up from £76m last year although some of the in-crease may be due to the department taking on new responsibilities including financial regulation Matthew Taylor of the Liberal Democrats said the Treasury's failure to live up to the same discipline it was imposing on other ministries showed the need for a more transparent system for holding the government to account over how public money is spent The Treasury sees target-setting as a way to increase its control over the rest of Whitehall and for Gordon Brown to increase his power in the Cabinet not as a genuine tool for improving the quality of government he said The report shows that the Treasury has hit or is on course to hit 35 of its other self-imposed targets such as achieving low inflation and high employment But it is also failing on several others including improving Britain's productivity performance and cutting the cost of managing the country's foreign exchange and gold reserves to zero Observer Page 21 www ft com/uknews,3
2002-06-04, When Anadolu Turkey's leading brewer decided last year to sell its car manufacturing business and to dispose of its bank it was responding to the country's worst economic crisis since 1945 But even as the company reined in domestically it made an aggressive push into foreign markets and last year managed to boost its sales of beer and soft drinks to Russia by 50 per cent Anadolu's strategy was typical of the Turkish companies that have best survived the 10 per cent reduction in gross national product triggered by the devaluation of the Turkish lira in February 2001 The crisis claimed many corporate victims but many of the survivors are focusing on a narrower range of businesses and accelerating their expansion abroad Ten per cent negative growth means a lot says Tuncay Ozilhan Anadolu's chief executive who also heads Tusiad the country's main business federation It needs to be followed by a reforming period  Mr Ozilhan whose family is co-founder and joint owner of Anadolu has put his money where his mouth is This year he sold Anadolu's stake in a carmaking joint venture with Honda to the Japanese group for $37m £25m He also began negotiations to sell a 51 per cent stake in the group's Alternatif Bank to France's Credit Agricole Indosuez Ozilhan realised that his previous strategy was wrong He's very good at beverages but not so good at other things such as banking says one western banker Apart from operating breweries in Russia Romania Kazakhstan Ukraine and Turkey where its Efes brand has a market share of 78 per cent Anadolu is Coca-Cola's partner in Turkey and its franchise-holder in four ex-Soviet republics It is also still involved in the production of light trucks and buses with Japan's Isuzu and in pencil-manufacturing with Germany's Faber Kastell Diversification on this scale defies western textbook recommendations for companies to focus on their core competence For most Turkish companies any divestment of a peripheral business is a step in the right direction Anadolu is likely to face further competitive pressure to specialise particularly if and when Turkey a candidate for membership of the European Union lifts barriers to imports and foreign direct investment Bulend Ozaydinli the recently appointed chief executive of Koc Turkey's largest industrial conglomerate with interests ranging from tomato paste to logistics says restructuring is now under way to achieve strength in selected sectors These areas include car production white and brown goods retailing and banking Of course we have to know what's going on in the world in terms of strategic trends says Ahmet Nazif Zorlu the majority shareholder of Vestel Turkey's top exporter of consumer electronics He also produces textiles but is said to be seeking a buyer for his bank Denizbank Maybe in the future we'll confine ourselves to production and give up services he says Groups pruning their range of activities are also looking for growth outside Turkey's borders Vestel which has had 15 per cent of the EU market for television sets since December last year derived 80 per cent of its $1 1bn consolidated revenues from exports Koc aims to increase foreign sales as a share of total turnover from 30 to 50 per cent over the next 15 years Koc knows that it cannot rely solely on a volatile domestic market to achieve its long-term goal of becoming one of the world's 200 biggest companies with sales of $40bn up from $10bn now This year alone it aims to open two more shopping centres and five supermarkets in Moscow where its Ramstore joint venture with Enka the Turkish construction company is the leading food retailer with 12 stores already But Koc sees advantages in a domestic base We see over the next 10 years an opportunity for Turkey to become a production centre for Europe because a lot of western European plants will be closed down argues Mr Ozaydinli There are drawbacks too he says This year Koc bought German and Austrian brands previously owned by France's Brandt group to get around the perceived disadvantage of a made in Turkey label on its cookers refrigerators and washing machines We have a handicap as an export-oriented Turkish company he says If you have a product manufactured in France or Germany you get a better retail price even if its quality is worse than the equivalent made in Turkey  The trend towards greater assertiveness abroad is not confined to Turkish blue-chip conglomerates such as Koc and Anadolu Organik a speciality chemicals producer with sales of $70m is building a $15m plant in Rotterdam to bring it closer to its customers and raw materials for which the Dutch port is an important distribution centre To be competitive we need to face competition on a daily basis and act very quickly This means investing outside Turkey says Aldo Kaslowski chairman of the privately held group founded in 1924 by his father a Polish immigrant We've found the courage to go and compete with the likes of Dow Chemical BASF and Dupont because they are    too big to cater for the specific needs of their customers  The Rotterdam plant to be completed in 18 months' time will supply Organik's western European customers Its existing Istanbul factory will serve markets in the Balkans and the Middle East as well as domestic customers in a shrunken market in which according to Mr Kaslowski all seven of his local competitors have disappeared over the past year But in most cases analysts observe that while the recent crisis has identified the strong it has yet to weed out all the weak This crisis showed which conglomerates were well managed and which were not says Mr Zorlu an entrepreneur who left school at 11 and managed his first business at the age of 15 We learnt a lot from the crisis and saw the realities  The early casualties consisted on the one hand of small businesses and on the other of those conglomerates whose failing banks were taken over by the state for posing a threat to the banking system But some bankers and industrialists say an unspecified number of other medium to large companies are being kept afloat by banks that are reluctant to declare loans to such groups as non-performing The reason we haven't seen too many bankruptcies is because everything's been pushed back says Mehmet Sami executive board member of Ata Invest an Istanbul brokerage Banks are drip-feeding those corporates that feel they can get out of their present predicament by crying for government help as in the old days As the Turkish proverb says 'There's nothing for those who don't cry '  The coming weeks will clarify how committed the government is to structural reforms promised to the International Monetary Fund which range from bank restructuring to tax changes If as hoped the reforms slash inflation and create a healthier macroeconomic environment for sound companies to prosper they should also have the effect of accelerating corporate restructuring A case in point is a three-stage audit of private sector banks to determine which institutions need government funds to meet statutory capital adequacy ratios The scheme has been billed as the last act in Turkish banking rehabilitation after badly managed banks triggered two financial crises in November 2000 and February 2001 The audit process is expected to be completed in June after missing an earlier deadline of mid-May The extent to which Turkey's quasi-independent banking regulators can uncover problem loans will determine the day of reckoning for owners of weak banks and less promising corporate borrowers This process should also be aided by a framework agreement now being finalised by the banks to co-operate on corporate restructuring with otherwise viable companies that have run out of cash The World Bank is contributing $500m to encourage banks to take part in a scheme widely referred to as the Istanbul approach Wearing his other hat as chief representative of the Turkish business community Mr Ozilhan expresses sympathy for less successful peers It's like a house of cards    everybody is trying to support each other until the good days come back ,2
2002-04-11, Coca-Cola's plan to launch a vanilla-flavoured Coke could give a much-needed boost to the world vanilla market which has been hit by a fall in demand following wild escalation in prices Vanilla extract is already an ingredient in Coke's so-called secret formula but if Coca-Cola decides to go ahead with the Vanilla Coke project the company could significantly increase its purchases of the product Vanilla is one of the world's most popular flavours being widely used in ice-cream and other dairy products desserts chocolate biscuits and sauces such as cre`me anglaise  But much of the market is served by artificial substitutes for the real thing Until two years ago the market for vanilla beans which grow in pods on trees had been running at about 2200 tonnes a year but in 2000 Madagascar the world's biggest vanilla producer was hit by a hurricane that destroyed about 35 per cent of the crop and 15 per cent of the stocks in storage As a result prices soared from $25-$40 a kilo in 1999 to their present level of $200-$230 a kilo and many food manufacturers unable to afford the high prices turned to artificial substitutes That led to a slump in demand for real vanilla just as producers attracted by the high prices were increasing production Now with annual demand down to about 1600 tonnes the market is facing over-production next year even though prices seem likely to fall The launch of a new vanilla product would help mop up some of the surplus production giving more stability to the market though one processor said the figures needed to be kept in perspective By some estimates Coca-Cola uses about 200 tonnes of vanilla a year to make Coke So even if a vanilla Coke generated an extra 10 per cent in sales it would increase annual vanilla demand by only 20 tonnes or 40 tonnes if the new drink used twice as much vanilla That figure could rise if competitors launched rival vanilla-flavoured products creating a new product sector The positive impact of increased demand however could be offset by the threat of civil war in Madagascar which is causing economic disruption and could again lead to turmoil in the world vanilla market ,2
2002-06-04, Castorama claimed a victory yesterday in its tussle with Kingfisher over the UK retailer's {XEU}5bn $4 7bn bid for control of the French DIY group It welcomed the replacement of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney by Rothschild as the bank that would provide a fair opinion on the value of Kingfisher's bid The French company said it hoped the change presided over by the Paris commercial court would put pressure on Kingfisher to raise its {XEU}67-a-share bid for the 45 per cent of Castorama it does not already own It had pursued the matter on behalf of the minority shareholders Castorama had objected to SSSB as the arbitrator of the bid's value Jean-Hughes Loyez chairman had said he was astonished to discover SSSB was financial adviser to Compass the UK catering group chaired by Francis Mackay who is also chairman of Kingfisher The Paris court said yesterday Without pronouncing on the independence of SSSB the two sides agreed to mandate Rothschild & Co  Kingfisher's advisers described Rothschild asa compromise bank seen as French in France and British in the City of London Rothschild has a month to evaluate Kingfisher's offer and will not take on work for either side for six months after its mandate Last week Kingfisher criticised Castorama's partners for using delaying tactics Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy chief executive said yesterday he was delighted the bid could move forward An SSSB adviser said the bank had never seen it as a conflict of interest to act for a different company in a different sector where the same directors are involved Kingfisher holds its annual shareholder meeting on Friday when management will seek backing for its Castorama bid Castorama's shares closed 5 cents higher at {XEU}67 45 www ft com/retail,1
2002-06-01, There are some partnerships you just cannot seem to get away from The Queen and Jubilees the property market and bubbles Vodafone and pay controversies This week the main focus of attention at Vodafone was its £13 5bn loss for the year but alongside that simmered a second issue should Sir Christopher Gent the chief executive be paid a special bonus of about £2m given the latest losses and the two thirds fall in the company's share price over the past two years The dispute resurrects a protest made by shareholders in 2000 when the company proposed paying Sir Christopher a special bonus of £10m for taking over Mannesmann the German phone company Half was to be in cash and half in shares which would vest two years later ie now provided certain targets were met At the time investors rightly objected that to pay an executive for merely doing a deal of unproven merit set a terrible example Vodafone backed down a bit saying it would never do this again and Sir Christopher promised to spend half his £5m of cash on company shares The company duly won the pay resolution at its annual meeting amid a large anti vote Sir Christopher then is legally entitled to his bonus provided the performance conditions have been met Both the board and shareholders approved it Whether it is politic for him to take it is another matter given the plunge in the share price which has of course sharply reduced the value of the bonus and the mixed performance of the German business Chief executives at some other companies have refused bonuses in similar conditions Some investors are muttering about raising the matter at the annual meeting but this would be a futile re-running of history They should save their breath for a more important issue Vodafone's new pay policy For the company has been working on a package for senior managers in the light of the 2000 criticism and further embarrassment last year over its plan which threw up such an extraordinarily large figure for Mr Gent's share options that the board felt it politic to cut it This time around it has been consulting extensively with City institutions It would be nice to think this will produce a model package but the controversy surrounding the pay scheme at Prudential which also took extensive City soundings is not terribly encouraging ,2
2002-06-04, It is a characteristic of the collapse of the US bull market that the very traits for which corporate titans were lauded at the peak of the economy acquisitiveness aggression autocratic leadership help precipitate their decline The deflation of Dennis Kozlowski who resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive of Tyco fits that mould almost exactly Like other humbled chiefs such as Bernie Ebbers former chairman and chief executive of WorldCom the telecommunications group Mr Kozlowski built his reputation on a string of deals in the 1990s Arguably he was even more successful than Mr Ebbers because whereas the telecoms sector was at the epicentre of the technology boom Bermuda-based Tyco was an amalgam of less glamorous businesses from plastic bags to electrical connectors Like Mr Ebbers Jeffrey Skilling of Enron and other bull market heroes Mr Kozlowski suffered the curse of the magazine cover BusinessWeek in May 2001 dubbed him The Most Aggressive CEO His resignation under the shadow of allegations that he avoided paying personal taxes may prove the final blow to Tyco already battered by Mr Kozlowski's switchback strategy changes in the past six months But his departure also revives broader questions about the management style of high-profile chief executives and the fatal charm of the conglomerate model Mr Kozlowski proudly championed When it came to playing the tune Wall Street wanted to hear during the boom years of the 1990s Mr Kozlowski had perfect pitch Few other American chief executives hit the right notes as accurately and as often Yet it was a touch that deserted him when the merger and acquisition boom evaporated Part of what made Mr Kozlowski so appealing was his ability to combine a grand vision with a sense of the pragmatic The visionary dreamt of building a global industrial titan to match General Electric the gold standard in durable corporate success The practical side stressed more prosaic values attention to costs an absence of corporate pomp an opportunistic approach to acquisitions In the midst of a high-tech boom Kozlowski made his mark with flow-control equipment and fire alarms That made the Tyco chairman seem like a regular guy amid the more familiar ranks of well groomed American executives His background suited him well for the role of down-to-earth outsider The son of a police detective and from a blue-collar New Jersey neighbourhood Mr Kozlowski worked to put himself through college at Seton Hall After training as an accountant he worked at two other companies before alighting at the age of 29 at Tyco then a manufacturer with sales measured in tens of millions of dollars not billions He came up the hard way says one person who has worked with him for 15 years From the start the future chief executive worked at honing the skills that were to turn him into one of the most successful deal-makers during Wall Street's biggest M&A flood In the process he created a machine for acquisitions which earned him the soubriquet again from Business-Week of Mr Deal-a-Month While retaining a link to his blue-collar roots Mr Kozlowski played out the American dream of fabulous wealth And at a time when US executives were taking home ever-larger pay packets the Tyco boss was among the best-remunerated CEOs He has been a big contributor to both Seton Hall and the United Way a charity though he has never sought any recognition for those donations an associate says But also splashed cash on ocean racing a traditional sport of the tycoon Mr Kozlowski's yacht the Endeavour is one of only three of the famously sleek J-class vessels to survive from the 1930s the grand era of the sport The company he formed also represented a throwback to the 1960s and 1970s when conglomer ates were in vogue even though many thought the concept had since been permanently discredited by the disintegration or decline of former stars such as ITT Gulf + Western and Teledyne Management experts believe the model was flawed Management has a good deal of difficulty staying on top of the skill-sets in these industries and that was the problem in the 1960s and 1970s says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld associate dean at the Yale School of Management It takes a shrieking audacity to presume that any leader or cluster of leaders could understand the emerging technologies in these fields  Mr Kozlowski had the audacity but unlike previous conglomerateurs he also had to face a faster-moving and arguably more demanding financial market Acquisitions and aggressive accounting helped to keep the momentum going But as Charlie Munger vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway the investment company said recently when asked about Teledyne Almost by the nature of things sometimes the horses get damn tired and they can't accelerate any more  The increased scrutiny levelled at fast-growing and complex companies following the collapse of Enron may have been the final straw All CEOs are operating pretty much against a different standard these days post-Enron says one prominent executive recruiter Everyone who's working with smoke and mirrors or is even suspected to doing so is going to get a lot of criticism  Even General Electric now widely held to be the exception that proves the rule that conglomerates do not work has been forced to improve its financial transparency Jeffrey Immelt chairman and chief executive disputes the conglomerate label He believes that conglomerates that lack GE's unifying philosophy are unlikely to succeed He told shareholders in April Like the late 70s the conglomerate again has an evil tone Conglomerates are basically businesses strung together with accounting You can't achieve growth because there aren't any connections  Robert Mittelstaedt vice-dean of executive education at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School says the only justification for conglomerates is if they achieve a lower cost of capital for the subsidiaries they embrace or they are able to train better leaders to run those businesses Mr Kozlowski managed to convince investors that Tyco had created that virtuous circle But he reckoned without the natural cycle of the market Over time people get excited about a conglomerate because it seems to be doing these things they bid the price up and the price-earnings multiple goes up and when it turns out they don't really do things any differently from anyone else and the acquisitions slow down people say 'Maybe we should break this thing up'  says Mr Mittelstaedt At least the Enron collapse and the subsequent humiliation of several high-profile chief executives should usher in a period of sober managers reined in by cautious boardrooms Mr Kozlowski's total compensation last year when the share price was already falling fast topped $40m £27m last year more even than each of the previous two years And as Charles Elson professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware says At a time when the company was coming under intense scrutiny his pay only fed investors' concerns  With hindsight that compensation package may represent the high-water mark for a generation of high-profile corporate leaders But even if Mr Kozlowski's departure presages a new dark age for the conglomerate model it will not deter entrepreneurs from trying again or investors from backing what seems to be the next big idea As Mr Mittelstaedt puts it The only good news is that economics works and at some point flawed companies get taken down because they don't make economic sense    The bad news is that people get hurt when the economics get out of balance ,2

2002-06-10, Deutsche Telekom the former German state monopoly whose shares have fallen to record lows over the past week has been the biggest loser in a recent poll taken among European market analysts based in Frankfurt FT Deutschland conducts a regular poll among about 20 stock market analysts in Frankfurt asking them which shares of the Stoxx 50 the European blue chip index and Germany's Dax 30 they would recommend for buying and selling judged by their prospects for growth over the next three months Deutsche Telekom was among the top five buy-recommendations last month but it has now been relegated to the company whose performance chances are considered worst Buy recommendations this time are led by Siemens the German electronics and engineering giant and DaimlerChrysler the US-German car-maker Judged by its price/earnings ratio Siemens is considered an attractive option among the technology stocks The share is also being credited with a lot of growth potential following restructuring Siemens is seen as a slightly defensive stock due to its involvement in industries such as medicine and power generation DaimlerChrysler is benefitting from analysts' confidence because it has been able to increase its market share in the US despite adverse market conditions However investors might consider that carmakers' shares have already been outperforming all other Stoxx 50 sector indices since the beginning of this year ThyssenKrupp the German steel and engineering group is another relatively defensive stock that is high up on the analysts' list Other favourites among the analysts were BMW the German luxury carmaker and the French groups Axa the insurer and BNP Paribas Europe's largest bank by market capitalisation Apart from Deutsche Telekom AstraZeneca the UK's biggest company by market capitalisation and Unilever the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group are among the shares accumulating the most sell-recommendations during this month's poll Many analysts consider AstraZeneca overvalued The share price rose last week again on news that Crestor the group's new cholesterol drug was likely to receive approval for the US market ,2
2002-06-20, Falling stock marketshave dragged the total wealth of the British public down by about 3 5 per cent over the past year despite the rise in house prices according to new calculations from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research Total household wealth in the UK including indirectly held assets in pension and life funds has been estimated by the institute at £3793bn in the second quarter of the year down £139bn from a year ago Since its peak in the third quarter of 2000 it has fallen by £415bn or almost 10 per cent Many people will not yet have fully appreciated the decline in the value of their assets because they follow house prices more closely than the value of their pension funds As public concern about pensions grows their shrinking assets are likely to persuade them to spend less and save more Over the past two years house prices have risen by 27 per cent according to the Halifax and Nationwide indices But share prices as measured by the FTSE 100 index have fallen by 28 per cent With most of the rise in the total value of houses being offset by a rise in mortgage debt which has grown by over £100bn in the past two years the net worth of the British public has fallen Economists would generally estimate that a 10 per cent change in household wealth would change consumption by between 0 5 and 1 per cent So far the decline in household wealth appears to have had little effect on consumer spending Last year consumption rose by almost 4 per cent and in the first quarter of this year it was up by 0 7 per cent Rising house prices appear to have counted for more than falling share prices because they are more visible and because they can be used as assets to secure borrowing But Nigel Pain of the institute believes the wealth effect will kick in eventually When people start to get information about shortfalls in pension funds and required increases in contributions then that starts to affect their consumption he says The changing composition of Britain's household wealth may also affect the pattern of consumption In 1996 66 per cent of people owned a home but only 42 per cent had a private pension and fewer than 16 per cent owned shares other than privatisations or de-mutualisations most of them at the top end of the wealth distribution Some of the markers for the consumption of the better-off show little sign of being affected by the malaise of the stock market In the five months to May Mercedes sales were up 13 per cent on the same period of the previous year and BMW sales were up 10 per cent Spending by British shoppers at upmarket retailers has also generally been strong But there are a few indications around that some big spenders may be chastened by their shrinking portfolios Hugo Kimber a consultant to the luxury travel company Western & Oriental says that this has not been a bad year for the business but it does not look like being a boom year either And customers have been tending to book later and later Lead times not all that long ago were generally a few months in advance he says Now lead times are a lot shorter Whenever there is any financial uncertainty people tend to make less long-term plans We will have a better handle on it by the time we get to September  If share prices continue to decline his view then is likely to be rather gloomier Editorial Comment Page 20,2
1998-04-03, Yugoslavia's sharp devaluation of the dinar has had immediate repercussions across the border in Bosnia and further strained relations with the reformist government in Montenegro partner with Serbia in the Yugoslav federation Officials representing the international community in Sarajevo yesterday welcomed an announcement by Milorad Dodik the pro-western Bosnian Serb prime minister that the D-Mark would become an official currency with the dinar in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia Western officials said Mr Dodik's decision demonstrated that his government was distancing itself from the Yugoslav government in Belgrade and paving the way for the introduction of a new single Bosnian currency the convertible marka which is pegged at parity to the D-Mark Shortly after Belgrade devalued the dinar by 45 per cent on Wednesday Mr Dodik said his administration wanted to shield Bosnian Serbs from the inflationary impact All wages of civil servants would be paid in D-Marks Four different currencies are used by Bosnia's still divided communities the D-Mark the Croatian kuna the Yugoslav dinar and the Bosnian dinar used in Moslem-controlled areas Western governments see the introduction of a single currency as a key step towards building a functioning state The convertible marka officially described as a coupon is being printed in France and should be in circulation next month In Banja Luka the main Serb-held city shopkeepers yesterday displayed prices in German D-Marks as well as convertible marka Officials in Belgrade fear an influx of dinars from Bosnia into Serbia that would undermine efforts to stabilise the weakened dinar at the new rate of six to DM1 The previous fixed rate was 3 3 The devaluation drew an angry response from Montenegro's prime minister Filip Vujanovic who said his government had not agreed to the devaluation which was decided at the federal Yugoslav level ,2
2002-06-25, Bertie Ahern is normally too canny a politician to say what he really thinks But as the Irish government prepares to re-run the referendum on the Nice treaty on enlargement of the European Union in October the prime minister surprised even his own colleagues with an attack this weekend on the whingers in the No camp who he said got away with hell and high water in the last campaign in June last year One junior minister suggested the remarks were not the way to go Editorials in both the Irish Times and Irish Independent yesterday questioned the prime minister's tactics But many observers believe if the referendum is to be won this time Mr Ahern and his ministers will have to take on the opponents of the treaty which provides for voting and institutional changes needed to accommodate new members from eastern Europe I hope it's an indication that the Taoiseach prime minister is going to get stuck in The fear is that he will take notice of the negative feedback says Ben Tonra lecturer in European politics at University College Dublin Last June Mr Ahern was blamed for a passionless campaign At the time all the main parties were reluctant to spend money knowing a general election was approaching Mr Ahern could have chosen to re-run the referendum on the same day as the election This would probably have avoided the low turnout that had such a critical effect on the result last time However the prime minister did not want to give prominence to the issues for fear it could provide an electoral advantage to the Greens and Sinn Fein the IRA's political wing both of which were looking to take votes from Mr Ahern's Fianna Fail The result was that by default the No camp was allowed to set the agenda for the entire campaign stoking fears about Irish neutrality A seven-point declaration on Irish neutrality signed at the weekend by the 15 EU leaders offers reassurance that Ireland's traditional stance is not imperilled by Nice or any other EU treaty But if there was an expectation that the solemn declaration secured at Seville would allow the debate to move on that does not seem to have been the case Some in Fianna Fail are said to be considering Labour party calls to include a separate referendum question enshrining neutrality in the constitution Ruairi Quinn's party might once have been seen as the most pro-EU voice in Irish politics but there was always a strong grassroots attachment to neutrality Labour's real concern is not to be outflanked on the left by the Greens and Sinn Fein both of which took Labour votes in last month's general election But Labour has also touched on a wider problem that the government is not trusted on the issue of neutrality Opponents point to the fact that Fianna Fail failed to keep the promise it made in opposition to put Ireland's participation in Nato's Partnership for Peace programme to a referendum However the ministry of foreign affairs is said to be urging the government not to tie its hands on neutrality warning that any constitutional amendment could give the courts the final say on the issue A final wording is expected to be agreed by cabinet this week with the bill tabled before parliament goes into recess for the summer The formal campaign will only get under way when the bill is passed by both houses some time in September with the Dail recalled two weeks earlier than usual But already the first shots have been fired On Irish radio yesterday Eamon O'Cuiv who voted No as a junior minister in the last government only to be rewarded with a full cabinet post insisted the the context had changed The only concrete example he was able to give was the Commission decision to increase payments to hill farmers Mr Ahern will be hoping his newly created minister for Europe Dick Roche can make a better case for ratification ,3
2002-04-06, The jewellery industry in spite of a global downturn in the economy has retained a cautious optimism Hopeful that the purchase of such things of beauty tends to be an emotional one romantic even jewellery is expected to weather well this year There is no doubt that the tail-end of last year was difficult for all industrial sectors the jewellery market was no exception However retail sales of platinum gold and diamond jewellery during the Christmas period were all above expectations especially in the US market and global results are therefore better than had been expected The weakening economy has had some effect on jewellery sales in Japan and Germany says James Courage chief executive officer of the Platinum Guild International At the same time the introduction of new designs and the growing economy in China has caused sales to increase there In many markets Christmas sales were better than anticipated especially in the US Last year was also marred by high platinum prices and destocking at the retail level but the indications from leading trade fairs to date show more visitors and more buying activity  Mr Courage adds The other market that has done well is the UK where hallmarking figures are up by 10 per cent In addition the return to family values in the US has increased the number of weddings and engagements which is the segment where platinum is particularly strong  The demand for gold jewellery was likewise depressed following the terrorist attacks on the US last September and the intensification of the global economic slowdown Sales of gold jewellery held at 767 tonnes for the last quarter of the year 4 per cent below the exceptionally high levels reached in the fourth quarter of 2000 when overall demand for gold reached a record Last year the demand for gold jewellery was 2840 tonnes down 2 per cent on 2000 in contrast to rising demand for gold for investment In the US the demand for gold reached a record for the 11th successive year with plain gold jewellery often purchased as a keepsake or as a symbol of relationship Haruko Fukuda chief executive of the World Gold Council says Jewellery demand may remain fragile in the first months of this year but I look forward to much stronger results later as the global economy recovers enabling the additional promotional measures we put in place last year to take their full effect  Meanwhile De Beers estimates that global retail sales of diamond jewellery for 2001 are 5 per cent down also following a stronger-than- expected fourth quarter and improved sales over Christmas The preliminary results have not hampered plans to launch the De Beers brand at the retail level Following the approval by the European Commission for the joint venture with LVMH for the company called De Beers LV the first store -is set to open in London later this year The issue of so-called conflict diamonds namely the'stones' coming out of countries which are at war came to a head in 2001 following the terrorist attacks on the US In response the World Diamond Council announced in mid-March its own measures to continue to combat the trade in conflict diamonds through a new process of warranties that will endorse each transaction of rough diamonds in trading centres around the world Never was there a time when the world's attention has been so focused on the activities of the diamond industry says Nicky Oppenheimer executive chairman of De Beers We all now share the same objectives an end to the trade in conflict diamonds the protection of the legitimate diamond industry the preservation of the integrity of our beautiful product and above all the retention of consumer confidence he says The jewellery industry is adapting to global events and trends within its most influential and important annual trade event the Basle World Watch and Jewellery Show which opened on Thursday Besides the cutting-edge jewellery styles for the coming year buyers can expect to see hall after hall of stylishly-designed exhibition space resembling a shopping mall of only jewellers with each stand portraying the ideals of the exhibiting brands to potential buyers The new jewellery sections are the biggest change to Basle's jewellery exhibition space since the show began 30 years ago and are marked by expanded and renamed jewellery halls We revamped the design of the Jewellery Hall to provide exhibitors with more space and a more luxurious ambience says Rene Kamm managing director of the Basle World Watch and Jewellery Show The concept of the Hall of Visions Hall of Feelings and Hall of Fantasies enables the jewellery brands to present themselves in a suitable environment following their philosophy and marketing strategy  Mr Kamm adds The importance of brands at the Basle show continues unabated Branding in jewellery is bigger than ever as consumers opt for the prestige design and image of branded goods a trend strongly influenced by the diversification of watch and fashion brands into jewellery  Basle 2002 offers a striking combination of individualistic and bold gemstone-focused and colourful jewellery following the path of fashion trends sprinkled with conservative and classic jewellery symbolic of an emotionally reflective return to basics US consumers in particular are calling for spiritually-influenced jewels such as crosses hearts and charms There demand is for classic jewels symbolic of a recession-driven and emotionally reflective return to basics to jewels that are timeless heirlooms and lasting expressions of love that are durable in both style and value ,2
2002-06-22, Ken Livingstone yesterday set out plans for the most far-reaching redevelopment of London since the city was rebuilt after the Great Fire in 1666 The mayor's proposals include the creation of office space for 600000 extra workers and the building of 130 schools Since Mr Livingstone was elected London's mayor in 2000 the popular perception has been of a newt-loving eccentric and former leftwinger The man once known as Red Ken has found himself in the news this week amid allegations of a cover-up following a fracas at a private party Yet under the capital's devolution legislation he has important powers that could have a huge influence on London's development The most important are drawing up and implementing the development plan involving an estimated £100bn $146bn of investment Aides said it will trigger a surge in office building equivalent to 75 office tower-blocks Some of the offices may have to be high-rise to comply with a ban on building on green space or extending London's boundaries Turning the plan into reality will be heavily dependent on private sector funding as well as billions of pounds of public funds mainly for transport links The 400-page plan includes several new rail lines and three new river crossings in east London Officials said talks with ministers on the use of taxpayers' money were going well because of government concern about an infrastructure crisis in London With the capital's population forecast to increase by 700000 to 8 1m over 15 years the London Plan is the first attempt to impose a strategic development framework on the city in more than a quarter of a century The planning powers will become binding on London's 33 boroughs next year after public consultation John Prescott deputy prime minister can seek changes only if the plan conflicts with national policy The proposals contain few costings apart from a call for an extra £150m from the government to increase affordable housing which must account for half of all homes built John Ross the mayor's senior economic adviser said detailed talks with ministers suggested little disagreement over funding because of London's importance to the economy In the plan Mr Livingstone warned Any attempt to hold back London's growth by denying it the necessary resources to maintain competitiveness or adopting policies that choke its development would degrade the economic efficiency of the city The issue is whether the scale of forecast growth is met with adequate policies and resources to allow the changes affecting London to be used for the benefit of Londoners and the UK economy If not the pressures of growth will overwhelm the city's resources  The draft London Plan appears likely to win cross-party support on the London assembly the 25-strong full-time elected body that scrutinises Mr Livingstone But planning experts warned yesterday that the plan could fail unless developers were given substantial new incentives to build on brownfield land Gideon Amos director of the Town and Country Planning Association said the plan to ban development on greenfield sites would not work without financial provision for clearing brownfield sites or public funds to clear them There is going to have to be alot of work done in bringing forward brownfield sites that are not coming forward at the moment he said Bob Neil a Conservative member of the London assembly gave the plan a guarded welcome but warned that the mayor would have to implement the plan in a way that would not choke off development ,3
1998-04-04, Energis shares have been heading into the stratosphere ever since their flotation last December outperforming a sharply rising market by nearly 100 per cent The clever deal with Germany's Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom shows there is at least some substance behind the puff The telecommunications group always had a cost advantage in providing a long-distance backbone network because it strings its cable over National Grid pylons Now it has found a cheap way of making the final connection with business customers The deal with the Germans and French means it can accelerate the local network roll-out while splitting the investment costs 5050 Energis will also be paid a management fee by the two continental operators as well as usage fees for any traffic they shunt over its backbone network Given that there is spare capacity on the backbone much of the extra revenue will drop to the bottom line Still investors should not get too excited Certainly those hoping this deal will pave the way for a high-premium takeover of Energis by the French and Germans may be disappointed Not only will the companies continue to compete for customers but the National Grid which controls Energis shows no sign of wanting to sell ,2
2002-06-06, Atos Origin a French information technology services provider took its first big step into consulting yesterday with the {XEU}657m $610m purchase of two KPMG consultancy divisions Accounting firms have been under pressure following the collapse of Enron to divest quickly their remaining consultancy activities in response to concerns about conflicts of interest with audit work Yesterday's deal for KPMG's UK and Dutch consulting businesses strikes a blow to US-based KPMG Consulting spun out of KPMG's tax and auditing business in 1999 which had pursued the UK business as part of its European expansion strategy Atos agreed to pay {XEU}422m in cash with the rest payable in a year's time in Atos shares derived from a convertible bond issue The transaction also includes performance-related warrants for the KPMG consulting partners Atos shares closed 1 6 per cent higher at {XEU}61 after rising as high as {XEU}63 9 during the day in Paris News of the deal lifted the shares of other companies in the sector as investors interpreted the move by Atos as a sign that consolidation might gather pace in spite of the sector's prolonged downturn Bernard Bourigeaud chief executive of Atos said he expected US companies in particular to try to exploit a recent improvement in their valuations compared with those of European peers by looking for European acquisitions in the coming months Mr Bourigeaud also said that Atos would continue to eye takeover opportunities in Germany the other leading market besides the UK where it has sought to gain clout However some analysts said Atos would find it hard to make another takeover move soon since yesterday's deal would leave it with net debt of {XEU}690m and one of the sector's highest levels of gearing at about 150 per cent Last month Atos lowered its earnings forecast saying it no longer expected an upturn in the second half of this year However Atos has been weathering the slowdown better than some rivals as clients have tried to lower costs by signing longer-term bulk contracts to cover computer needs Atos predicted the takeover of the two units would add to earnings from completion expected by year-end Atos is taking over two units with combined sales of {XEU}600m and about 2800 employees creating a group with {XEU}3 7bn of sales and 30000 employees KPMG Consulting had held talks with the UK arm and reaffirmed its interest last month after agreeing to pay up to $284m for the bulk of Andersen Worldwide's global consulting business which includes a substantial presence in continental Europe but not in the UK KPMG Consulting declined to comment on how the proposed Atos deal would affect its European plans ,1
2002-06-21, Private equity deals are growing The number of large deals those bigger than {XEU}1bn being signed by private equity firms are on the rise as companies restructure and shed non-core divisions and firms have bigger funds to buy them According to Dealogic so far this year there were five private equity transactions of more than {XEU}1bn in Europe including National Car Parks which Cinven is buying for {XEU}1 3bn and Vivendi's professional publishing business which is being bought by Cinven Carlyle and Apax Partners for {XEU}1 6bn Most firms have a limit on how much their backers permit them to invest in one transaction A typical limit is 15-20 per cent of a fund but most firms would be uneasy going that high says Lyndon Lea a partner at Hicks Muse Tate & Furst in London That ceiling has encouraged firms to team up with one another to make large acquisitions that would otherwise exceed their limits Increasingly as companies shy away from the merger and acquisition market and focus on their existing businesses groups selling divisions with no likely trade buyers now have the additional option of selling to financial buyers as well as floating to the public says Mr Lea For many years European companies considered private equity firms to be buyers of last resort A lot of big deals were done but the buyer universe was narrower I wonder if Vodafone was being spun out of Racal today whether it would have been a private equity sale says Mr Lea However the increased buying power formed by the combination of two or three firms can lead to high prices and bidding wars One example is the {XEU}3 1bn buy-out last year of Eircom the Irish telecommunications company There were two private equity consortia in a bidding war until the price tag surpassed even the most optimistic estimates In some deals we need the firepower to do it and in others if two teams have different angles they are better off combining to get it done says Chris Spencer a director at Candover Perhaps one firm has more experience in the sector while another has a good management team lined up Together they would make a more complete bidder Other times bidders get together to avoid an Eircom-like expensive battle That is what has been happening in the sale of Energis There were two bidders vying for the telecoms company's UK business They were Permira on one side and Apax Partners and the Carlyle Group on the other On the day final bids were due the two got together and declined to submit offers According to people close to the firms they thought a group bid would give them a better negotiating position Sometimes it is useful to team up to have a number of strong angles to win the deal such as knowing the sector the management team and the vendor says Mr Spencer at Candover Investors would typically welcome a group bid because it would reduce their exposure to any one deal The only time they might object is if an investor who puts money in a number of different private equity funds finds he backs two firms that have teamed up thus leaving him doubly exposed to the transaction Such an investor could avoid the overexposure if one of the firms in the deal raised money for each deal rather than keeping a fund at its disposal like Investcorp After a record number of mega buy-outs in 2000 the number of deals has been steady Last year there were nine private equity buy-outs worth more than {XEU}1bn which included two of the largest transactions since 1998 Both of those mega-deals the buyout from British Telecom of Yell the directories business and Eircom of Ireland were bought by consortia of private equity firms Apax and Hicks Muse bought Yell for {XEU}3 5bn while Providence Equity Partners Goldman Sachs private equity and Soros Private Equity Partners bought Eircom the telecoms firm for {XEU}3 1bn Though if current trends keep up the market is likely to drop off along with merger and acquisition volume The number of large deals not just private equity buy-outs has fallen along with executive confidence and stock markets According to the Centre for Management Buy-out Research at the University of Nottingham the average UK deal value last year dropped to £31 4m versus £39 9m in 2000 In the first quarter of this year the average deal size was just £26 5m ,1

2002-04-20, Government plans for increased spending on the National Health Service ought to boost investor interest in the health and pharmaceutical sectors My personal pension scheme has investments in six pharmaceutical firms Their performance has so far been variable For example I bought shares in SkyePharmain October 2000 for 80p each having high hopes for Solaraze a cream the firm developed to treat pre-cancerous skin conditions The company had also developed ways to enhance the release timing of various drugs in the body and had links with a number of big pharmaceutical firms Its share price has been erratic trading between 46p to 109p in 2001 and starting this year at 57 5p before moving much closer to my purchase price It closed yesterday at 79 5p I still have confidence in the company's long-term future particularly as it has increased its relationships with groups such as GlaxoSmithKline and has a number of products at various stages of development In November last year I added Oxford Biomedica to my personal pension after reading favourable press comments about the company's trial results for TroVax an anti-cancer vaccine and ProSavin for the treatment of Parkinson's disease I also liked what I read in its annual report for 2000 though I could not say the same for the full page colour photo of chairman Dr Peter Johnson and chief executive Professor Alan Kingsman As at December 31 2001 Oxford Biomedica had cash of £32 6m My Oxford Biomedica shares cost 26p each By February this year the shares were 45 5p after which they began a sharp slide towards my purchase price Another disappointing performer is Xenova Group Originally my pension scheme held shares in Cantab Pharmaceuticals bought in July 1999 for 196p each Cantab's performance was so poor that it eventually merged with Xenova on the basis of 11 new Xenova shares for every 7 Cantab shares I hope Xenova's research into vaccines to combat cocaine addiction and the development of various anti-cancer compounds will eventually prove rewarding All three of these firms are high-risk but even if they continue to disappoint my pension scheme's pharmaceutical investments will still be ahead thanks to Cambridge Antibody Technology which I bought in July 1999 for 186p each and subsequently sold for between £12 40 and £29 25 Another star performer whose shares I still hold is Acambis The shares I bought in October last year for 148p each are now over 300p Acambis has a big contract for the supply of the smallpox vaccine for the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention The company has a range of other vaccines at various stages of development including one against Japanese encephalitis dengue fever hepatitis C typhoid and diarrhoea Generally I tend to back small companies but in February this year I paid SFr62 10 each for shares in Novartis the big Swiss-based firm that operates in more than 140 countries and has sales of about $19 1bn £13 2bn I was attracted to Novartis because of the possibilities for its Glivec drug known in the US as Gleevec which has received medical acclaim for its effectiveness in treating chronic myeloid leukaemia I believe Novartis is another long-term hold especially since Glivec is being developed as a treatment for other types of cancer and the company's research and development projects are considerable Another drug in development is Certican to help reduce rejection in transplant surgery ,2

2002-06-07, Sales fell less than expected last month at Gap the struggling US retailer but unseasonably cool weather led to a disappointing May at many of its rivals The downbeat figures brought US retail stocks under pressure in morning trading yesterday Target the discount superstore group was down more than 5 per cent and Sears Roebuck the department store group down 2 per cent after both reported weaker sales than expected This was the second successive month that leading US retailers' sales figures had disappointed Wall Street although government figures suggest overall consumer spending is strong April sales also suffered from poor weather and this year's early Easter Gap reported sales at stores open at least a year down 9 per cent in May its 26th consecutive monthly decline But that beat some analysts' expectations of a double-digit fall and April's 24 per cent slump The San Francisco-based retailer is trying to entice shoppers by shifting back from the avant-garde fashions that had alienated its core customers towards classic chinos jeans and white shirts But its recovery prospects were thrown into question last month after Millard Mickey Drexler Gap's long-time chief executive said he would retire as soon as a successor was found Heidi Kunz Gap's chief financial officer warned yesterday that a comparatively strong June last year meant this month's figures would probably be weak Unseasonably cool weather especially in the US north-east and mid-west held back demand for summer ranges across the clothing sector But Dorothy Lakner retail analyst at CIBC World Markets said evidence that retailers were controlling their inventories tightly and limiting price-cutting meant there had been few changes to analysts' earnings estimates There was some reason to be optimistic she said We are seeing inventory discipline as well as expense discipline  Same-store sales were down 5 1 per cent at JC Penney's department stores and 3 4 per cent at Federated owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's Sears Roebuck with a stronger focus on hardware also reported same-store sales down 4 4 per cent But Kohl's whose formula of selling cut-price branded goods in a department store format has turned it into the fastest-growing US retailer continued to buck the trend The Wisconsin-based group reported same-store sales up 8 7 per cent The clothing focus at Target the nation's second-biggest discount giant led to May same-store sales up only 2 6 per cent That was below analysts' forecasts and arch-rival Wal-Mart's 6 2 per cent increase which was reported on Wednesday www ft com/retail,2
2002-06-28, After Guatemala's second annual internet coffee auction this week attracted buyers paying up to 16 times the international price for arabica beans nearby Nicaragua is preparing for its first event on July 2 Internet selling is a growing trend as global prices fall The top bid at Tuesday's auction saw Michel's Espresso of Australia pay $8 45 a pound for coffee produced by the Manila plantation in San Marcos province western Guatemala The New York arabica contract by contrast closed at 49 9 cents a pound that day The Manila plantation won Guatemala's annual internationally-judged Cup of Excellence cupping competition and other entrants also did well at auction A farm in the mountainous Huehuetenango region earned $6 25 a pound while one from Antigua traditional centre of Guatemalan coffee received $5 50 In all 33 producers sold 1170 150-pound sacks of coffee to 172 bidders earning more than $530000 Fernando Montenegro president of Anacafe the country's growers' association praised the auction as a success and said more would be organised In this way part of the price that is paid for a cup of coffee overseas can reach the producer directly he said At last year's auction coffee growers dealt fewer sacks of coffee 615 but received higher prices collecting $400000 with the top lot going for $11 a pound However the fall pales against the precipitate drop in traditional exports in Guatemala This 2001-2002 season saw 4 3m 100-pound bags sold generating $172m The year before 5 7m bags earned $339m Nicaragua which is also suffering from low prices holds its first auction on July 2 after joining the Cup of Excellence competition judged by a panel of 26 expert international cuppers Some 23 producers including 13 small-scale and co-operative farms were deemed good enough to enter Nicaraguan coffee has been regarded as of poorer quality but the auction should change that said one judge Steve Leach of Diedrich Coffee California Nicaragua has long deserved to be on the same quality playing field as the rest of the producing world he said Hopefully this event will help achieve that goal  Brazil has also joined the Cup of Excellence competition and auction system Panama held an independent second successful internet auction in May ,1

2002-04-18, Yes this was an important political moment Tony Blair's government has put up taxes before Often Yesterday was different Gordon Brown owned up More than that the chancellor came as close as he decently could to boasting about it If Britain wants good public services above all modern hospitals and enough doctors Britons will have to pay for them After all those detours along a road to nowhere called the Third Way Mr Blair's government has finally settled for something called social democracy The Budget wasn't Old Labour socialism Mr Brown's sleight of hand on national insurance contributions has in effect pushed the top rate of income tax up to 41 per cent And business will fume about increases in employers' contributions But the pips are not squeaking yet and anyone with share options has been given a big windfall bonus through the cuts in capital gains tax By the end of this parliament public spending as a share of national income will still be in line with the proportions seen in the heyday of Thatcherism during the 1980s Similarly for taxes Mr Brown has guarded too his reputation for fiscal conservatism There are the usual Treasury fiddles with the arithmetic but the chancellor is still playing within his self-imposed rules That said direction counts in politics This Budget foreshadows a sharp change in perceptions The self-declared purpose of the government's first term was to show that New Labour had rid itself of the Old Labour addiction to tax and spend Now that it has proved to itself anyway that it is a social rather than a compulsive spender it can spend again And how Only we must not call it spending Investment sounds a lot less threatening Mr Brown has given the voters a picture of public spending rising as far as the eye can see He has explained how he will pay for it for the next two or three years or so But beyond that Those who witnessed the relentless ducking diving and deliberate evasion by Messrs Blair and Brown during last summer's election campaign must be forgiven a certain cynicism This is unlikely to be the last tax-raising Budget All this creates space for the Conservatives room for an argument about the size of the state and about the financing of health and other public services Forget about precise levels of spending this year or next The medium to long term is where the debate will lie Should Britain really be resigned to an inexorable expansion of state-funded services and the higher taxes to pay for them Don't those Europeans with their social insurance system have something we can learn from After all Derek Wanless's review of the NHS which Mr Brown has taken as his bible says that health spending and by implication taxes will have to grow faster than the economy for the next 20 years That's the point intelligent Conservatives will now be making Mr Brown's contention is that the Wanless report draws a line under the argument about how to fund health spending On the contrary that debate has just started If the flood of taxpayers' cash into the NHS produces sharp improvements before the next election Mr Brown may well be proved right But that is a big If More likely it will take time for the resources to make a visible impact Doctors and nurses have to be trained new hospitals built The pain of the tax increases will be felt sooner If the perception is that all the money is fast disappearing into a large black hole the financing issue will move back to the top of the agenda That's the gamble of this Budget On taxes Mr Brown did not have much choice Those tricksters in the Treasury have run out of stealth taxes The government's decision at the last election to rule out rises in income tax rates forced it into the corner of higher national insurance contributions And now it intends to spend serious money Labour's first decade in office Mr Brown boasted will see spending on the NHS double in real terms On top of these unprecedented increases this summer's comprehensive spending review will see the education and transport budgets still expanding much faster than the economy as a whole You cannot but admire the chancellor's performances Gordon Brown at the House of Commons despatch box is as good as it gets Sure the posture is self-satisfied the style hectoring But here is a politician who understands the power of the words Perhaps I misheard but I feel sure that at one point he declared it was the government's patriotic duty to raise taxes It is more than rhetoric Mr Brown speaks from the conviction that government can remould society that fairness and enterprise can indeed sit comfortably side by side The mind-numbing complexity of the plethora of tax credits he has introduced for children pensioners and the working poor belies their importance in redistributing wealth to the worst-off in society Simultaneously the tax breaks for entrepreneurs reflect a genuine belief that government can fan the embers of enterprise This is a complex politician The risks are the obvious ones Change takes time For all the mantras about modernisation private-public sector partnerships and the rest the government has been peculiarly inept in managing public services It still seems hopelessly confused about where the boundaries should lie between public and private delivery of taxpayer-funded services Obsessed by centrally-set targets it has yet to grasp that those responsible for delivering services should be left to get on with it And of course all its spending plans are based on a presumption that the economic climate will never again turn nasty For the present Mr Brown has probably caught the mood of Britain Modernising public services is worth a shot even some pain But this Budget asks the voters to take the government on trust And trust in politicians is in scarce supply these days ,3

1998-04-01, TriStar Pictures one of the best-known Hollywood brand names is to disappear following the decision of Sony Pictures to fold the studio into its larger Columbia Pictures subsidiary John Calley the former film producer and MGM executive who took charge of Sony Pictures as president and chief operating officer last year said that pooling production through two studios had led to inefficiency and internal rivalry The future of TriStar which was formed 16 years ago by a joint venture between Columbia Pictures CBS Television and Home Box Office has been in doubt ever since Sony the Japanese electronics group acquired it and Columbia Pictures in 1989 TriStar has had a series of box office successes including the recent hits As Good As It Gets and My Best Friend's Wedding  but it has not carved out an independent identity from the 74-year-old Columbia Sony executives stressed in Tokyo yesterday that the decision to fold TriStar into Columbia had been taken by Mr Calley's team in Los Angeles and did not stem from corporate headquarters in Japan However the Japanese parent company has taken a more hands-on approach towards Sony Pictures since Nobuyuki Idei's appointment as group president By the time he took the top job Sony had poured huge amounts of capital into its film subsidiary and written down $3 2bn on its investment Mr Idei a cosmopolitan manager who had worked extensively outside Japan quickly made his mark with the removal of Mickey Schulhof who had led Sony into Hollywood as head of its US interests After installing his own executive team at Sony's US operations in 1996 Mr Idei indicated Tokyo would be taking a more activist approach This change of strategy was highlighted by the abrupt departure earlier this year of Jeffrey Sagansky co-president of the film and television company He cited intervention from the Japanese parent company as the main reason for his leaving Recently Sony Pictures has become a star contributor to group profits Godzilla  another TriStar picture is tipped to be one of the highest-grossing films of this summer ,1
2002-06-18, Romano Prodi European Commission president will today announce a shock plan to shake-up his team creating a new inner cabinet to push through reforms Mr Prodi's move an audacious attempt to assert his grip comes after months of public disagreement in the Commission on issues ranging from fisheries policy to reforming car sales He wants to create an inner core of fewer than 10 vice-presidents concentrating on what he calls a limited number of essential tasks That would leave many of the existing 20 commissioners relegated to an outer team which would meet only once or twice a month to set political strategy The decisive step represents a bold gambit from a Commission president often accused of being weak and of leading an increasingly fractious team But it could create considerable tension between those left outside the inner circle For instance Mr Prodi suggests a single vice-president should supervise areas including international trade and external relations the two fiefdoms of respectively Pascal Lamy and Chris Patten two of the Commission's heaviest hitters Mr Lamy a former chef de cabinet of Jacques Delors the former Commission president is thought to have been influential in the plan Mr Prodi halfway into his five-year term wants the changes to be in place before the enlargement of the EU by up to 10 countries in 2004 He says that he can carry out the sweeping reforms without any need for changes to EU treaties An official close to Mr Prodi said last night that individual members of the Commission had been told of the proposal but the whole team will only get its first chance to debate it today Mr Prodi's paper talks of a team of vice-presidents each of whom would be given the task of supervising a group of areas sharing responsibility with two or three commissioners depending on the scope of the fields covered He suggests grouping external relations trade development aid and humanitarian assistance Another group might include employment social affairs and training another economic fiscal and customs policy While the whole Commission would only meet once or twice a month to discuss broad strategy the inner cabinet would meet at least once a week Mr Prodi's strategy has been in gestation for many weeks and is designed to address the question of how the Commission can operate after enlargement when the number of commissioners could swell to 25 or 30 members An overhaul of our working methods cannot be put off and everything that can be done with the existing treaties should be tackled immediately he writes One short year is all there is to prepare for the situation after enlargement  He would like the new Commission structure to echo reforms being planned for the council of ministers expected to be confirmed at this week's Seville EU summit to reduce the number of ministerial sectoral councils from 16 to 10 But the reforms the most fundamental in the working of the Commission for years also reflect Mr Prodi's exasperation with trying to make a team of 20 work as an effective executive Disagreements between commissioners have been leaked on issues including fisheries policy car sales and most recently over Mr Prodi's ambitious proposals for the Commission to have more power over foreign policy ,3
2002-06-06, Germany's governing Social Democratic party SPD could face conflict with some of its closest trade union supporters if it proceeds with plans to streamline the Federal Labour Office in a second term of office Walter Riester labour minister said a critical examination of how the labour office undertook job training would be one of the prime functions of a wide ranging review committee established this year He stressed the main aim would be to improve the office's efficiency in finding work for Germany's almost 4m unemployed It's very important that we use resources much more effectively to direct training to the type of jobs available We must become much more targeted  Such streamlining would however lead to job losses at the Federal Labour Office itself and many trade union operated training establishments The impending clash contrasts with clear signs from the SPD to build support among the unions before September's general elections In an interview with the Financial Times Mr Riester expressed confidence that reform of the labour office which employs about 90000 people and is one of the biggest drains on government expenditure would proceed quickly and smoothly under its new management The agency came under severe criticism this year after revelations that staff had exaggerated success rates in finding jobs for applicants The scandal led to the replacement of Bernhard Jagoda the labour office's chairman with Florian Gerster the highly-regarded SPD social minister from Rhineland Palatinate The change was accompanied by the creation of a review commission under Peter Hartz a top Volkswagen executive The committee is expected to propose slimming down the bloated institution reducing costs and raising effectiveness when it reports in August I'm pleased that the new labour office chairman no longer wants to be reliant on federal subsidies and even wants to reduce contribution rates for the unemployment insurance scheme although I still see problems there for next year in view of the economic climate said Mr Riester The government has this year budgeted {XEU}2bn £1 3bn for funding the labour office's expected deficit Mr Riester said he hoped to lower employees' social security and state pension contributions to below 40 per cent of gross salary from 41 3 per cent at present ,3
2002-06-27, Banks and insurers were left reeling yesterday as the market wondered to what extent their balance sheets would be affected by exposure to WorldCom Most of the big banks and insurance companies issued statements quantifying their positions in WorldCom loans and bonds or denying any significant exposure While this may have saved the sector from a more dramatic slump share prices still fell to new lows before levelling out later Abbey National which announced a couple of weeks ago it would be taking additional provisions on bad loans at its wholesale banking unit slid 33p to 737p to a near two-year low making it the worst performing stock among the top British banks However the company denied any material exposure to WorldCom credit Barclays also said it had no material exposure to the US telecommunications giant but analysts estimated its losses could amount to £75m or £100m still significantly lower than some investors could have feared Barclays stock fell 18{1/2}p to 522p Lloyds TSB said its exposure to WorldCom was not significant but shed 6{1/2}p to 653{1/2}p But financial services providers were not only undermined by credit exposure concerns Insurers suffered as the health of their balance sheets deteriorated in the face of continuing equity market weakness Royal & Sun Alliance fell 14{1/2}p to 233p Doubts about solvency capital also hit Prudential whose shares dropped 13{1/2}p to 556{1/2}p Prudential was hurt further by news that it holds $150m in WorldCom bonds Amvescap the largest listed fund manager on the London exchange was the

2002-04-16, When members of the wealthy Weston family go shopping one might expect shop owners to jump to attention Through Wittington Investments the transatlantic family dynasty already owns two luxury retailers Fortnum & Mason and Heals Now they are the focus of speculation over potential buyers of Liberty the chic department store that first brought the exotic fabrics of the Orient to London more than 100 years ago and has been marked for disposal by its owner Marylebone Warwick Balfour The mock-Tudor store which attracts thousands of visitors a year from all corners of the globe is best known for its luxurious ambiance It's a house of treats says John Ball retail managing director of the flagship London store But its plush carpets and dark wooden panelling give off an air of tradition and continuity that disguises the management upheavals of the past decade The company has still to recover from the serial strategic changes it was forced to make after the bitter battles in the late 1990s between management and the founding Stewart-Liberty family backed by Brian Myerson the activist investor The brand has suffered from under-investment for the past 25 years says Richard Balfour Lynn chief executive of MWB which bought a 68 per cent stake in Liberty for £72m in shares in 2000 The following year Liberty lost more than £6m followed by £13 2m in the last six months of 2001 The remainder is owned mainly by Mr Myerson joint head of UK Active Value the shareholder activist fund who has had a stake in the store for the past 10 years Although the current owners find it easy to blame Liberty's problems on past errors uncertainty over their own strategy means the retailer's fate remains unclear While angling for potential purchasers who might include Wittington Selfridges or Harvey Nichols MWB plans to spend more money regenerating the brand At the moment Liberty's property is of greater value than its brand says Mr Balfour Lynn The see-sawing of management strategy has contributed to the brand's low value In the 1990s Liberty had four different chief executives all with a different vision for the store And the key strategy dilemma whether Liberty is just the flagship store or a brand that can be exploited elsewhere is still unresolved Mr Balfour-Lynn says If we don't sell Liberty the next step might be to get a distribution network or maybe link up with an international partner  Such words may send a shiver down the spines of investors who have watched as previous management has been brought down by ambitious plans for expansion or redevelopment The refurbishment plans of Denis Cassidy former chairman prompted his ousting in 1997 He was planning a £39m redevelopment of the flagship store had closed 20 lossmaking regional stores and axed 500 jobs But despite his efforts share price performance was disappointing and after a long and bitter battle he was ousted by the Stewart-Libertys and Mr Myerson who held over 44 per cent of the shares Liberty's current management has already spent £9m and plans to spend at least £9m more on refurbishment We are targeting £800-£900 sales per square foot from a current £600 says Mr Ball an achievement that would put Liberty on the same level as more successful competitors like Selfridges and Harvey Nichols To achieve its target Liberty has cut overheads and redesigned the store to make navigating the famously maze-like building easier It also plans to continue its strategy of not selling by brand We sell men's shirts ranged by colour and ladies' perfume by fragrance not by brand says Mr Ball The unusual display style has been a characteristic ever since its founder Arthur Lasenby Liberty opened the first Regent Street store in 1875 Since 1894 Liberty has been a public company but the family kept majority control and management changes were few and far between But this all changed in the 1990s By May 1998 after yet another strategic U-turn and management change the shares were at an 11-year low When Retail Stores the vehicle for MWB and Myerson bought Liberty two years later they brought in yet another management team which closed down Liberty's fledgling internet and wholesale businesses Fiona Harrison brought in as chief executive in December 2001 previously ran the fashion division of Coats Viyella and John Ball was an independent consultant who worked at Jaeger the fashion retailer Their ability to turn round a brand like Liberty is unproven The brand apart Liberty's price when it is sold will depend on the value assigned to its properties Lasenby House Regent House and the Tudor building In 2000 they were valued by MWB's advisers at £54 9m and the brand at £28 7m MWB plans to put Lasenby House on the market shortly it is now rented out to MWB's struggling serviced offices subsidiary Business Exchange which also rents the top five floors of the Regent Street building But MWB may find it difficult to attract a buyer Analysts say the properties are not easy to manage partly because of their complex ownership structure and warren-like design Moreover the Liberty name is inextricably linked with the listed Tudor-style building It's not clear whether the brand and the property deserve to have separate values says an analyst ,2
2002-04-09, The big US airlines will next week reveal the full extent of the damage inflicted by the September 11 terrorist attacks on first-quarter results with analysts estimating the nation's nine largest airlines made a combined net loss of $2 2bn The forecast by Merrill Lynch indicates an improvement over the fourth quarter when a slump in air traffic demand led to a total net loss of $3bn Airlines are cautiously optimistic of a gradual improvement in profits this year as passenger demand and US air fares improve The near-term picture however remains mostly grim Higher fuel prices crude oil jumped to six-month highs last week and increased costs for security labour and insurance are all adding to airlines' woes A loss is a loss and we can't get too excited about the improvement in the quarter said Michael Linenberg Merrill Lynch's airline analyst in New York Mr Linenberg expects revenue for the airlines to fall 22 per cent in the March quarter from year-ago levels Merrill lowered its March earnings per share forecast for UAL US Airways and smaller carriers AirTran Frontier Mesaba and Southwest It raised its outlook for AMR the parent of American Airlines the world's largest carrier Continental and Midwest Express Consensus forecasts for AMR are for a loss of $3 12 a share UAL the second-largest US carrier is expected to report a loss of $10 53 after posting the largest loss in the US airline industry last year US Airways is expected to lose $5 84 a share and Continental's loss is tipped to be $2 12 a share The results will also be skewed by government grants and credit draw-downs offered to the industry Glen Engel at Goldman Sachs said there were some positive signs Passenger revenue had improved at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent a month since its low point in September when people opted not to fly A1per cent gain in passenger revenue could offset a $2 rise in the price of crude oil he said The big airlines hedge against oil price spikes as jet fuel accounts for 15 to 20 per cent of carriers' total costs AMR Continental and Delta are all hedged at about 35 per cent Southwest Airlines is about 60 per cent hedged for fuel Mr Linenberg estimates that every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of oil would cost the airline sector $400m Continental will unveil its results on April 15 and Delta on April 16 Northwest Airlines is due to report on April 18 along with Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air UAL will report its results on April 19 ,2
2002-04-06, Gordon Brown is ready to risk tax rises of well above £5bn in the Budget to restore a comfortable cushion to the public finances and pay for a large increase in health spending The Treasury has signalled that £5bn in extra revenue is required merely to cover existing commitments on tax credits for low-wage earners which increase sharply in value next year Tax rises are also required to maintain a budget surplus of several billion pounds last year's budget forecast a surplus balance of £14bn for 2002/03 Experts also say that if the chancellor intends to keep health spending growing at the current 6 4 per cent rate an additional £2 5bn a year would have to be found That would push the tax bill to £7 5bn more than most predictions One Treasury insider said yesterday The chancellor will stick to his cautious approach to management of the public finances He will not seek the soft option and is prepared to make the difficult decisions necessary to meet his tough fiscal rules while delivering on the government's manifesto commitments he said Research by investment bank Schroder Salomon Smith Barney predicted increases in public spending could be funded by allowing the current surplus which the pre-budget report in November cut for 2002/03 to an estimated £3bn to fall close to zero in 2004-2006 That would be in line with the fiscal rules that demand the budget is balanced over the the business cycle Mr Brown has made clear that sustaining the generous margin for error in budget figures was not up for negotiation Mr Brown's determination to retain a high degree of caution may make it more difficult politically to justify tax rises Tony Blair wants the chancellor to sugar the pill by convincing voters that all the extra cash will be devoted to the health service The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that maintaining the 6 4 per cent increase awarded to health in the 2000 spending review would cost another £2 5bn a year If education spending continues to grow at 5 4 per cent another £4bn would have to be found In last year's budget Mr Brown forecast a surplus balance of £14bn for 2002/03 falling to £8bn and £9bn in the following years The pre-budget in November cut the forecasts for 2002/03 to £3bn £4bn £7bn and £8bn Some City forecasters have suggested the government has laid a false trail with hints of big tax rises They say the tax credit bill could be met and extra money for schools and hospitals found if Mr Brown were prepared to run down the surplus www ft com/uk,3
1998-04-03, The emergence of what Bertie Ahern the Irish prime minister calls large disagreements between himself and Tony Blair sounds very worrying with only a week to go till the deadline both governments had set for agreement on Northern Ireland's future at the multi-party talks in Belfast But in fact it may be a sign that the talks and the deadline are at last being taken seriously by all the parties involved Until a week or so ago talk of an agreement being agonisingly close came mainly from the two governments and from moderate Northern Irish parties such as the Catholic SDLP and the small bicommunal Alliance Both Sinn Fein the political wing of the IRA and more crucially the Ulster Unionists were making sceptical noises But now Sinn Fein is signalling its eagerness to be in on the deal and yesterday David Trimble the Unionist leader voiced his concern that Irish posturing might harm the talks It may push back the date for agreement he said and that would be cruel to the people of Northern Ireland who have a certain hope  That statement is significant If Mr Trimble thinks the Irish government is posturing he must believe on the basis of several long meetings he has had with Mr Ahern in the last few months that its real position is one he could accept Implicitly at least he is saying he now believes an agreement really could be reached next week if only Mr Ahern plays it straight For years a constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland has been a hypothesis with which all sides could play Now suddenly it seems an imminent reality and both sides are working frantically to ensure it does not take a form which will be hard for them to sell to their supporters The sticking point is the proposed north-south bodies Mr Ahern is trying to hold Mr Blair to the concession made by his predecessor John Major who agreed that these bodies should be set up by legislation Mr Blair can counter by pointing to another clause in the 1995 Framework Document which said their functions should be defined with the agreement of the parties It should not matter Legislation should hold no terrors for unionists provided it is clear that the bodies will act only by consensus and that their northern members will be answerable to the new Northern Ireland Assembly But equally the Irish government should recognise that accepting such bodies at all is a very bold step forward by the unionist side and should not jeopardise this by insisting on a symbolic point that is hard for unionists to swallow The prize is within reach We may be about to witness the most exciting and most hopeful moment in Irish history since the island was partitioned in 1921 ,3
2002-06-26, It has been hailed as one of the fastest growing and most attractive markets in the world accounting for 25 per cent of all equity capital raising But after four years of strong growth the convertible bond market has hit hard times Dealogic the data provider says global issuance of convertibles has fallen by $20bn £13 6bn from $89 8bn in the first half of last year to $69 9bn in the first half of this year Analysts say this is the first significant decline in issuance since 1998 Returns are also on the way down For this year so far UBS Warburg's convertible bond index shows negative returns of 3 9 per cent Hedge funds have been among the biggest investors in convertibles One banker says They are the engine of demand for convertible bonds  Though companies prefer to sell convertibles to traditional buy and hold investors market participants say hedge funds now account for about 50 per cent of demand compared with 10 per cent five years ago The funds aim to make money on sharp swings in the price of the underlying equity by arbitraging shares and options Simon McGuire head of convertible bond origination at UBS Warburg says Hedge funds don't care if the equity market goes up or down as long as volatility remains high  But while hedge funds enjoyed annual returns of up to 20 per cent over the past three years they are now seeing steep declines in profits Hedge fund returns for convertible arbitrage are down to a negative 0 7 per cent for the year to the end of May according to the CSFB-Tremont hedge fund index This compares with returns of 14 6 per cent in 2001 The main reason that hedge funds are suffering is the reduced volatility in equity markets which makes convertible bond arbitrage less profitable Because of their highly leveraged positions hedge funds may run into difficulties if returns on convertibles continue to fall although somes analysts say there a signs that volatility could pick up in the second half of the year One banker says The main risk is a global liquidity squeeze which would erode the ability of hedge funds to obtain credit and restrict their ability to trade in the underlying shares  For buy and hold investors the situation is no better Hedge funds often strip the fixed-income part of convertible bonds selling or hedging the fixed-income portion through derivatives but retaining the equity portion In contrast traditional investors are suffering from the deteriorating credit quality of convertibles and widening credit spreads Michael O'Connor head of convertible bond research at Deutsche Bank said The current position on credit spreads is not sustainable  Falling equity prices over the past three years also mean that investors are losing money on their option to convert into the underlying equity though not as much as they would have lost if they had invested in shares Five years ago 90 per cent of convertibles were converted into shares Now most bonds will be redeemed Low share prices also mean companies are reluctant to issue convertibles However Mr O'Connor says companies that need to roll over debt may have no option but to issue new bonds even if conditions continue to deteriorate In spite of recent falls in issuance and returns however few are concerned about the future of the market Mr O'Connor says Convertibles are no longer a marginal or exotic asset class With an average deal size of $500m-$1bn convertibles are in the mainstream of the capital markets and will not disappear overnight  Lex Page 20 Capital markets Page 31,2
2002-06-29, Danka Business Systems saw its shares rally almost fivefold between January and March of this year after spending all of 2001 below 20p The photocopier supplier has struggled since its acquisition of Eastman Kodak's photocopier business in 1996 and saw its debt peak at £825m in 1998 The sector has endured difficult times as digital multifunction machines have taken over from the straight copiers of the past Danka made gains of £122m from the sale of various businesses and £33m from a debt refinancing in 2001 but this did not supply the impetus to lift its stock Beeson Gregory Danka's adviser and the only broker to cover the group said the rally began after a stronger performance by Danka's US peers sparked UK investors' interest Danka cut its debt to £166m by March 31 2002 and managed to turn an operating loss of £11 7m into a profit of £15 4m even as revenues fell The shares have since dropped from a high of 86p to 50{3/4}p yesterday down 1{1/4}p Danka's turnround story is at an early stage and the focus on lifting margins and providing more value-added services to go with its new generation of printers and systems means there should be better to come Paul Davies,2
2002-06-13, Univision Univision which has long looked an acquisition target continues to do deals The purchase of Hispanic Broadcasting underlines why Viacom and others have had no joy with Jerrold Perenchio Univision's chairman chief executive and controlling shareholder In any language 40 times earnings before depreciation interest and tax for HB's radio stations raises the question of what planet he is on Spanish language broadcasting is growing fast and demographics are on Univision's side Combining television and radio provides cross promotional opportunities and a compelling advertising platform But the $3 5bn price tag suggests either that Mr Perenchio sees incredible scope for revenue synergies the details of which have not been revealed or that he believes his stock is overvalued whatever the fighting talk about a required $65 a share take-out price for Univision The multiple of 40 times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation compares with the 30 times that General Electric's NBC paid for Telemundo At 26{1/2} per cent of the combined group HB shareholders get a disproportionate share of potential synergies The blot for HB shareholders is that the 0 85 exchange ratio is fixed and Univision is down 17 per cent since Monday But Clear Channel Communications has pledged its 26 per cent stake and it is hard to see why HB's other shareholders would pass it up It is also difficult to make the sums work for Univision shareholders Given that HB brings no debt its bondholders have more to celebrate ,1
1998-04-02, Fund managers have taken the unusual step of protesting to the government about a Budget increase in casino gaming duty Scottish Widows Mercury Asset Management and Jupiter Asset Management are among the institutional investors in London Clubs and Capital Corporation the two most affected casino companies to have written to the Treasury Shares in London Clubs and Capital Corporation have fallen by 26 per cent and 20 per cent respectively since the Budget measure two weeks ago which increased the top rate of gaming duty from 33{1/3} per cent to 40 per cent The four casino duty thresholds were also lowered The measure which came into effect yesterday primarily affects London casinos which pay 80 per cent of gaming duty London Clubs the largest London operator said if the increases had been applied last year it would have paid 60 per cent of the sum amounting to £12m or 30 per cent of pre-tax profits It's a body blow to us Where does it end Are they going to attack us next year again said Alan Goodenough chief executive of London Clubs yesterday He said the company would consider moving its corporate headquarters to Las Vegas where the tax regime was less punitive and could also encourage its customers more than 80 per cent of whom are from overseas to gamble at its casinos outside the UK The company would also no longer be able to invest in its London properties which include Les Ambassadeurs and the Ritz casinos Mr Goodenough called for the measure to be reversed or to be spread equally spread across the industry Fund managers said they were concerned at the apparently arbitrary nature of the rise and questioned why it affected primarily two companies Stan Pearson head of UK equities at Scottish Widows which has a 5 per stake in London Clubs asked whether the Budget measure represented a shift in attitude towards the gaming industries This has a material effect on the profits of London Clubs Can we expect other industries to be hit similarly What is next property perhaps,2
2002-06-03, AstraZeneca the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group is planning to sell Marlow Foods the North Yorkshire-based company that makes the Quorn substitute meat products The group has appointed Goldman Sachs the investment bank to handle the disposal and details of the business have been circulated to interested parties According to reports yesterday the company could fetch up to £100m In January Marlow Foods reported annual sales of $103m £70m up from $90m the year before While it is understood that AstraZeneca has not made a final decision on whether to sell the business a disposal would fit into the group's strategy of concentrating on its core pharmaceutical business Marlow Foods was part of Zeneca's speciality chemicals division and was the only business the group retained when it sold the division to a venture capital group for £1 3bn three years ago The move comes at a critical time for AstraZeneca which could later this month lose patent protection for Prisolec its £6bn a year ulcer drug depending on the decision of a New York court The group will also learn in June whether it can launch Crestor a cholesterol-lowering treatment that could play a crucial role in offsetting the fall in revenues should the protection for Prisolec expire Founded in 1975 Marlow's main product is Quorn which according to the company provides the taste and texture of a full range of meat products and ready meals but is entirely meat free It is based on mycoprotein a microscopic plant related to edible fungi such as mushrooms and truffles Quorn products are sold across Europe and were earlier this year introduced in the US ,1
2002-06-06, This is not a life complains an exhausted Spanish diplomat as he slumps into a dining chair for an unusually brief luncheon The strain of holding the European Union's six-month presidency is taking its toll Javier Conde Madrid's ambassador to the EU suffered a heart attack in March on the eve of an EU economic summit in Barcelona By the fifth month Jose Maria Aznar's overstretched staff were also buckling under the strain of organising three summits and more than two dozen ministerial meetings in Spain in addition to the prime minister's crowded agenda overseas Is it worth it Mr Aznar's aides have their doubts They argue that the pressure to achieve successes in a six-month time span is unrealistic and runs counter to the painfully slow process of consensus building among 15 member states As a result Spain supports a French and British proposal to create a new post of president of the European Council The aim would be to give Europe a political leader who would be the EU's international face Tony Blair the British prime minister believes the new president would give the EU a sharper identity He or she would replace the rotating six-month presidencies which have been blamed for failing to give leadership or political direction to the EU's complex and expanding agenda Both Mr Blair and Mr Aznar have emerged as strong candidates for the new post which would be created in 2005 or 2006 if it wins overall support Mr Aznar believes the EU's frequent summits and rotating presidencies have become unhelpful They generate unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved in the short life-span of a presidency Too much time is wasted on achieving short-term deals Mr Aznar said in an interview at the start of the Barcelona summit The EU should lengthen its horizons It should set its sights on medium and long-term goals  His comments reflect Spain's frustration at trying to push forward the EU's economic liberalisation agenda when several member states including France Portugal Ireland and the Netherlands have been distracted by domestic elections The centre-piece of the Barcelona summit should have been an agreement to free and link up Europe's electricity and gas markets but full liberalisation was blocked by France where these utilities are state-owned The wrangling at Barcelona exposed a serious rift within the EU on the speed and timing of economic reforms Some member states are warning of the danger of a two-track Europe with laggards such as France effectively blocking the creation of a single European market in electricity and gas On other aspects of EU policy Spain has proved less of a torch-bearer for reform Plans to scale back aid to the fishing industry have been blocked by Spain which has Europe's largest fishing fleet and is also the largest recipient of EU aid Spain's intensive lobbying against reforms to the EU's Common Fisheries Policy has been deemed controversial and contrary to EU convention The country which holds the EU presidency is supposed to leave aside its national interests for six months and act instead as an honest broker Mr Aznar has also made a big push to ensure that EU policy on immigration and other security issues dovetail neatly with his priorities at home Both Spain and Italy had been campaigning for a long time for the EU to adopt tougher curbs on illegal migrants The Seville summit at the end of June which was to have focused on enlargement is likely to be dominated by the search for a common policy on immigration and asylum ,3

2002-06-22, All references to ever-closer union should be removed from the European Union's treaties MPs said yesterday in a striking intervention timed to coincide with the start of the intergovernmental conference in Seville The Labour-dominated European scrutiny committee also said that proportional representation for UK elections to the European parliament should be scrapped and replaced by a first-past-the-post system In a report translated for the first time into French and German it demanded a greater role for national parliaments in the EU decision- making process and said the Convention on the Future of Europe should not make any decisions about the EU's future The reference to ever-closer union should be removed from the treaties the committee said in a section of a report that was agreed unanimously by its members We do not regard it as appropriate for a treaty to commit the peoples it covers to such a vague and open-ended process Removing the phrase from the treaties would help to reduce the perception that the EU is engaged in a one-way process towards greater centralisation regardless of what citizens want it added Jimmy Hood the Labour chairman of the committee said National parliaments have a much closer relationship with their peoples than any EU institution does and they can therefore play a crucial role in bridging the increasingly obvious and damaging gap between citizens and EU institutions  The committee said proportional representation for the European parliament was not working because constituencies were too big for people to get to know their representative It recommended that the party-list system be abandoned in favour of first past the post and a constituency-based system This proposal was carried only by the chairman's casting vote The committee said that giving national parliaments a greater role within the EU was the only way to bridge the disconnection between citizens and EU institutions However it rejected the idea of national parliament vetoes or of establishing a second chamber in the European parliament composed of representatives from national parliaments Instead the committee demanded that the Council of Ministers meet in public whenever making laws and that time be set aside for all legislation to be scrutinised by national parliaments as a fundamental aspect of accountability It supported replacing the system of rotating presidents of the European Council with an elected president with a term of two years or more but only if national parliaments had a say in the selection and could join in scrutiny of his office It called for a watchdog to be set up to ensure that all activity at the EU level passed the subsidiarity test the principle that the EU should only tackle what it could do more effectively than national parliaments We favour a system in which national parliamentarians could refer items of legislation to a subsidiarity watchdog it said adding that this should be a political body in which national parliaments were represented ,3

2002-04-12, Andersen and prosecutors from the US department of justice are moving closer to a deal to settle the obstruction of justice charges against the audit firm but a final deal could still be elusive Lawyers close to the talks said negotiations between the two sides had picked up momentum after Tuesday's guilty plea by David Duncan the former Andersen accountant who led the shredding of Enron-related records in the firm's Houston office The lawyers said that Mr Duncan's plea had freed Andersen's hand in the negotiations by allowing them to acknowledge wrongdoing Mr Duncan is believed to have provided the justice department with detailed information about how the shredding was carried out Prior to Mr Duncan's plea Andersen's lawyers had shunned any admission of wrongdoing There had been fears that implicating Mr Duncan would make the entire firm liable under corporate law However after Mr Duncan's plea Andersen has more latitude to deal with the department of justice prosecutors The deal under consideration by Andersen would allow for a deferred prosecution against the firm essentially probation in return for an admission of wrongdoing The deal is also said to include a co-operation agreement on other Enron-related inquiries Meanwhile Andersen's global network continued to be dismembered yesterday because of its disastrous association with Enron Andersen has admitted to a mistake in its audit of Enron which became the world's biggest bankruptcy in December But Aldo Cardoso Andersen's acting chief executive said the firm could not be held responsible for the bankruptcy There was a bankruptcy and documents were destroyed Mr Cardoso said The two must not be mixed up Andersen did not cause the bankruptcy and the destroyed documents certainly did not either Andersen is trapped in the middle  KPMG yesterday announced plans to combine with Andersen's practices in Germany and South Africa KPMG had wanted to combine with all Andersen's practices outside the US but the plans were undermined by defections to rival professional services firms Harald Wiedmann head of KPMG in Germany said he hoped a memorandum of understanding would be signed with Andersen's German practice in the next few days Christoph Gross managing partner of Andersen Germany Austria and Switzerland had preferred a link with KPMG because it is market leader in Germany Mr Wiedmann said a deal should be finalised by September and expressed confidence that it would not be blocked by regulators KPMG also yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with Andersen's practice in South Africa KPMG said Due to the excellent reputation and service of Andersen in South Africa no client or staff losses have occurred in South Africa  However KPMG failed to secure Andersen's Taiwan practice TN Soong & Co the Taiwan member of Andersen Worldwide signed a memorandum of understanding with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu A TN Soong official said the two firms would operate independently in an initial phase but would later combine On Wednesday Andersen UK announced plans to combine with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu ,1
2002-06-01, The government crackdown on small business banking will cost HSBC £80m a year and lead to a reduction in competition Sir John Bond the bank's chairman warned yesterday Sir John who strongly resisted the Competition Commission's accusation this year that the big four banks operate a complex monopoly said the government's action would backfire In a stinging attack on the government's urge to regulate he said the raft of reviews since Gordon Brown started investigating banking in 1998 had cost the bank Britain's biggest £100m We are concerned that the cumulative effect of the various regulatory measures is not actually in the best interests of our shareholders our customers the financial services industry or perhaps the public at large he said Analysts at Lehman Brothers said the cost to HSBC of price controls imposed on small business banking implied Royal Bank of Scotland faced a bill of £160m a year and Barclays £100m Sir John also renounced any ambitions to join the bulge bracket of investment banks but insisted HSBC remained committed to a substantial presence in the industry He dismissed a series of departures from its investment bank as a fact of life even though it was prompted by the decision to pay them no bonus last year Our aim is not to position ourselves as a bulge bracket investment bank but rather to have a substantial investment bank tailored to HSBC's needs which serves our formidable client base he said The statement at the bank's annual meeting in London will kill off any remaining suggestions that the bank could buy Merrill Lynch the US investment bank Merrill last month pulled out of a joint venture aimed at the wealthy in which HSBC had invested $200m £137m Shares in HSBC rose 20{1/2}p to 850p despite a downbeat statement on trading as analysts scaled back forecasts of bad debts The bank said this year's bad debts would be broadly in line with last year's $1 4bn excluding the $600m charge for exposure to Argentina ,2
2002-04-04, Police are facing a £97m insurance claim from a Lloyd's of London insurer over damage caused by asylum seekers to the Yarl's Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire which in February was set ablaze only three months after opening The claim more than double the £38m original estimated loss has been lodged by the DJ Pye syndicate at Lloyd's against Bedfordshire Police Authority under the Riot Damages Act of 1886 which allows companies and individuals to sue police over damage caused during civil disturbances The undamaged section of Yarl's Wood centre was shut temporarily at the weekend because of lack of agreement on insurance cover Group 4 the security company responsible for the centre said the cover offered on renewal by DJ Pye was inadequate to continue operations there Alistair Burt Tory MP for North East Bedfordshire described the £97m claim as complete and utter nonsense and urged the government to resolve the issue which he said was stifling Britain's asylum policy Peter May claims manager for DJ Pye said The claim has been based on the cost of building it in the first place and working out what part of it is damaged which is approximately 50 per cent It is a claim for among other things loss of revenue  Adrian Heffernan chairman of the Bedfordshire Police Authority said Any claim made against the authority under the Riot Damages Act is totally outrageous and will be vigorously resisted  Mr May said The act does not deal with blame it deals with statutory responsibility It should not be confused with pointing the finger at the police as being to blame for the incident  Mr Burt said it was utter nonsense that a local police force could be held responsible in these circumstances He added Our national policy on asylum detention and removals is currently in the hands of an insurance syndicate at Lloyd's This is unacceptable  The Home Office is in talks with Group 4 and the insurer ,3

2002-06-08, MASTER OF THE SENATE The Years of Lyndon Johnson Vol III by Robert Caro Knopf $35 1167 pages Three volumes 2571 pages 26 years of hard work and he still has not reached the White House Can the life of any one individual however remarkable possibly justify such effort Those who have been waiting 12 years for the latest episode of Robert Caro's astonishing story of Lyndon Baines Johnson already know the answer Volume Three which covers LBJ's years in the Senate from 1949 to 1960 has all the breadth colour and pace of its predecessors Like them it is far more than a conventional biography First it is a study of power and its uses both as exercised by institutions and by individuals In the first half of the 20th century the role of the US Senate had subtly altered shifting away from the independent body of wise and dis-passionate leaders envisioned by the founding fathers Caro shows how by the late 1940s the Senate had reached a point where the seniority system and the use of filibusters had jammed its procedures and turned it into a barrier against social progress This made the impact of LBJ all the more remarkable I do understand power he once said I know where to look for it  He found it in places where no one else was looking Previous Democratic leaders in the Senate had been broken by the deep hostility between the conservative Southern bloc and the liberals from the North Johnson went after the leadership job with single-minded determination at the age of 44 he was easily the youngest Majority Leader in history and he used it ruthlessly to fulfil his ambitions A small example you could identify his allies by measuring the size of their offices Second Caro paints a broad and brilliant picture of America in a period of great social and political change The book starts with a cameo of blacks who wished to vote being humiliated in Alabama It finishes with the first civil rights legislation to pass through the legislature since 1875 The exodus of black Americans from the South in the 1950s became the largest American migration since the pioneers had driven west in their covered wagons They were moving to the great cities of the North registering as voters and beginning to have a profound impact on the political balance of power The 1956 election marked a turning point Of all the major groups in the nation's population pollster George Gallup reported the one that shifted most to the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket was the Negro voter  As the migration continued the possibility opened up that the Republican Party would be able to hold on to the White House even without Ike at its head And the third irresistible reason for writing on this scale is the character and importance of LBJ himself One of the outstanding political figures of the 20th century he could have been among the greatest presidents But he also had deep and ultimately disastrous flaws Volume Three shows him at the very height of his powers funny cruel brilliant manipulative running the Senate like a personal fiefdom With the vote all but upon him now he seemed always to be in motion and the motion would be faster almost frenzied As he talked to senators his hands never stopped moving gesturing expressively chopping the air with that snake-killing gesture opening a palm to illustrate a point punching the air with a fist jabbing a lapel with a finger patting a senator's shoulder straightening his tie grabbing his lapel hugging him if he agreed to the proposition being made  The big question for readers of the first two volumes was this How could a man whom Caro had painted in the darkest colours in the early years of his life turn into the architect of the Great Society How could a political leader who for 20 years had resolutely opposed every attempt at civil rights legislation even voting against bills aimed to protect blacks from lynching have turned into the greatest champion that African and Mexican Americans had seen in the White House since Abraham Lincoln There are two answers The first is the passage of time LBJ appears to mellow a little especially after his heart attack in 1955 He is less brutal to his staff He starts at last to treat Lady Bird with some respect and she in turn begins the transformation from a shy and retiring creature into her present status as a national living treasure It is possible that time has mellowed Caro a little too Certainly his judgments seem more generous in this volume He argues that Johnson's capacity for compassion had always been held in check by his quest for power Now he had the power and the qualities that had been hidden hitherto could be revealed in full The second explanation is that LBJ's own ambitions began to coincide with a broader set of public interests When the two came in conflict as they did as late as 1956 with an attempt to pass a civil rights bill ambition won the day LBJ threw a road block in the path of the liberals But it was already clear that anyone who wanted to be president which Johnson did desperately was going to have to adjust to the new realities of American politics He came from Texas one of the 11 states of the Confederacy the taint of the South was on him To achieve his goal he had to change his position The central theme of the book is made up of LBJ's tortuous and eventually successful efforts to build a bridge to the liberal democrats of the North without losing either the support of his fellow senators from the South or just as important the financial backing of his deeply conservative sponsors in Texas This was a rocky and very narrow path to power In Caro's words being linked with the South would keep him from rising beyond the Senate Yet being linked with the South was the only way in which he could rise within the Senate  It took a legislative genius to break out of this dilemma with the passage of civil rights legislation in 1957 The Southerners stayed with him at least in part because they believed that if change was inevitable they could count on LBJ to do as little as possible The liberals went along with what seemed like a weak and token piece of law-making because they believed correctly that it would breach the dam The long passage of this bill is meat and drink to Caro There are the scoops of an investigative reporter and the eye for detail of someone who has spent a large part of his life on this trail And then there are the wonderful pieces of story telling In the early morning hours the residential districts of Washington and its suburbs were dark and silent but now in the night the silence of a darkened street would be broken by the faint ringing of a telephone in a senator's house The senator picking it up would hear 'This is Lyndon Johnson'  In the fourth and what he promises will be the final volume Caro will take us through the vice presidency and into the White House The best and the worst is yet to come ,3

2002-06-21, When Ranks Hovis McDougall the UK bread and biscuit group raised £650m through the sale of asset-backed bonds last year many people in private equity predicted the start of a new era for European leveraged finance The company was one of the first leveraged buy-outs to be funded through securitisation the sale of bonds backed by ring-fenced cashflows from RHM's brands such as Hovis bread Mr Kipling cakes and Bisto gravy powder Doughty Hanson which bought RHM in 2000 was able to raise cash at a lower cost than in the leveraged loan or high-yield bond markets thanks to the extra security provided by these stable cashflows This whole-business securitisation model had been established in the UK pub sector by luminaries such as Guy Hands of Nomura This allowed financial buyers to securitise pub revenues through large bond sales including from Punch Taverns Unique and Pubmaster The expansion of the pub securitisation model to other sectors was emphasised when General Healthcare a private hospital operator in the UK sold £975m of asset-backed bonds in July 2001 Proceeds from the deal secured on patient fees and a property portfolio refinanced the £1 29m secondary buy-out of the company by BC Partners from Cinven But since the General Healthcare securitisation there have been few asset-backed leveraged finance deals on the radar screen Some have written off whole-business securitisation as a flash in the pan a gimmick invented by bankers to boost their fees Banks strong in this field say they have many whole-business securitisation deals in the pipeline due to emerge in coming months But the requirement of predictable cashflows means the asset-backed financing model does not suit all LBOs For a successful securitisation you need a company with long-term stable cashflows and very high barriers to entry which is not always the typical situation in a leveraged buy-out where private equity sponsors sometimes target high-growth or turnaround stories says Bill Young head of the European structured and principal finance group at Goldman Sachs Whole-business securitisations can create significant value in acquisition finance but securitisation is not always more efficient than traditional leveraged finance and is sometimes misused says Mr Young At the end of the day it is a niche product that is not going to take over the financing of the LBO market  Robert Palache a former Nomura banker now in the infrastructure finance and corporate securitisation team at Barclays Capital is more enthusiastic about the potential of asset-backed leverage finance in Europe For the right asset class and the right company securitisation is very cost effective Why issue a high-yield bond when you can do a securitisation at half the margin The pub sector is likely to be a source of securitisation deals this year Cinven's {XEU}3 2bn purchase of Nomura's pub portfolio is likely to be refinanced through asset-backed bonds Also in the pipeline is an eye-catching securitisation to be backed by supplies of whisky Last year German bank WestLB backed a £208m management buy-out of Scottish whisky distiller Whyte & Mackay with bank debt provided on the understanding it would be refinanced in the asset-backed bond market WestLB plans to launch the deal secured on steady cashflows from the spirits businesses this year The renamed Kyndal group's whisky securitisation echoes a popular {XEU}400m champagne-backed bond deal launched in 2000 by Groupe Marne et Champagne Something like a whisky business is a very suitable candidate for securitisation as it is based on real products with tangible value like the securitisation of champagne stocks in 2000 says Mr Palache In a less cheerful area of business HSBC Private Equity is looking at securitisation to refinance its leveraged buy-out of Dignity Caring funeral homes and crematoria in the UK This year the financial sponsor took a 65 per cent stake in Dignity Caring as part of a £220m management buy-out from Service Corporation International With a steady death rate in the UK and proven cashflows the funerals services business is an ideal candidate for asset-backed financing We would be daft not to investigate the option of securitisation for Dignity Caring says David Farley at HSBC Private Equity The sponsor is talking to banks about whether asset-backed bonds would be more cost-effective than a long-term leveraged loan and hopes to make a decision in a few months If it goes ahead securitisation could provide cheaper finance than the loan market and longer-term debt that better suits Dignity Caring's liabilities says Mr Farley ,1
2002-04-19, Taxes may have to rise further in future years if the government is to fund its promises to the health service and continue to increase other departmental spending at current rates the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned yesterday In the Budget Gordon Brown committed the government to an average annual increase in spending on health of 7 4 per cent ahead of inflation for the next five years but set out detailed plans for taxation and total public spending only for three years The IFS said to meet that commitment to health in the two extra years either spending on other departments would have to be tightly controlled or taxes or government borrowing would have to rise With Treasury forecasts showing the public finances just about meeting the chancellor's self-imposed rules while leaving some margin for error the scope for extra borrowing seems limited The IFS is seen as the most reliable independent authority on the public finances The Treasury said yesterday that any predictions of the need for future tax rises could only be based on assumptions about the next spending review not due until 2004 Because Treasury forecasts of tax revenues and public spending are based on deliberately gloomy assumptions about the economy the actual figures are likely to turn out better than their published projections But Andrew Dilnot of the IFS said that although the details might be uncertain it was still right to question whether the Budget tax rises which will raise about £8 3bn extra by 2005-06 would be enough to satisfy all the government's ambitions for public services If it was only the health service that the government wished to improve he said then the extra resources could quite easily be secured But Mr Brown has also committed himself to increasing the share of national income spent on education and has set a target to end child poverty There are also pressures for increased spending coming from transport defence and the Home Office The current spending review which will conclude in the summer setting out departmental spending plans until 2005-06 may not be tight even after health has taken out its generous allocation the IFS said Christine Frayne of the IFS said that over the three years covered by the plans education spending could rise by 5 4 per cent a year in real terms social security benefits by 3 3 per cent still leaving room for the rest to rise by 3 1 per cent a year This would give other departments scope to increase their budgets as a share of national income Mr Dilnot said If this growth in spending is a trend that the government might like to see continued in other areas apart from health then how might it be financed Do we really think that a tax increase of about 1 per cent of gross domestic product will be sufficient,3
1998-04-03, From Malcolm Bruce MP Sir Your leader Sterling in another world April 2 indicates that you believe that the Treasury has tightened fiscal policy enough and that interest rates should now probably rise to avoid inflationary risks You are perhaps being a little too kind to the government in two respects First much of the fiscal tightening has come in areas which have had little effect on consumer demand in the short term taxes on savings and businesses lower than budgeted public expenditure and so on When the chancellor was asked by the Treasury Select Committee this week to list the actions which he has taken to dampen consumer demand he could only point to a reduction of mortgage tax relief which is only just taking effect a reduction in tax relief via the married couple's allowance which takes place in 1999 with the proceeds spent on child benefit higher stamp duty on highly priced properties and higher petrol tax These measures will have only a very limited effect on consumer demand It is also regrettable that the chancellor's commitment to stability in fiscal policy and inflation has not yet been matched by a firm commitment to stability of the exchange rate in terms of Britain's early entry into the single currency Where you may be right is that given the government's policy inaction in the above two areas the Bank of England may soon have little choice other than to tighten monetary policy further if there are not convincing signs of a slowdown in the non-manufacturing economy Such a move would reflect the present asymmetric risk of allowing the expansion to generate serious inflationary pressures Also given the present dangers both of inflation or recession which the government's one-club approach have caused it is also true that interest rate changes now at least have the merit that they can be reversed quickly once the economic slowdown is finally confirmed Malcolm Bruce Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman and member of the Treasury select committee House of Commons London SW1A 0AA,2
2002-06-11, Ryanair claimed yesterday that it was Europe's only low fares carrier as it announced a 44 per cent increase in net profits from {XEU}104 5m £67 6m to {XEU}150 4m in spite of an 8 per cent fall in average fares It attacked its main rival EasyJet which is in the process of taking over Go the smaller UK no-frills operator and said its average fare in the year to the end of March was only £33 compared with £52 of acombined EasyJet-Go Michael O'Leary chief executive said Ryanair planned to accelerate its annual growth to between 30 and 35 per cent for the next two years partly in response to the EasyJet-Go merger before falling back to 25 per cent Ryanair was the Wal-Mart among airlines said Mr O'Leary with the formula of piling them high and selling them cheap The group's recent success in Germany where it is biting into Lufthansa's market share showed that customers would flock to out-of-town secondary locations in order to avail themselves of lower prices and avoid congestion Mr O'Leary who has led the growth of Ryanair into Europe's most profitable airline said he had no plans to follow Stelios Haji-Ioannou founder and chairman of EasyJet by pulling out of the airline business It was getting boring but EasyJet taking over Go is giving us real competition  He said he would give up only when Ryanair had overtaken British Airways Lufthansa and Air France to become the leading European short-haul airline He forecast Ryanair would be carrying 40m passengers a year by 2008 up from 13m this year I don't see there is any more to do after that You cannot run around Europe whingeing about the big airlines when you are the biggest he said Yesterday's results exceeded market expectations and were achieved in the most difficult year the aviation industry has faced in the past decade Many rival carriers are awash in red ink including British Airways which recently announced a pre-tax loss of £200m Pre-tax profits increased by 39 7 per cent from {XEU}123 3m to {XEU}172 4m in spite of the impact of foot and mouth disease and the September 11 terrorist attacks Ryanair's share price rose 45 cents or 7 3 per cent to {XEU}6 65 Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had begun talks with Boeing the US aircraft maker to bring forward some of its options for new aircraft in 2003 and 2004 only six months after announcing an order for 100 aircraft and options on a further 50 Nats action urged Page 2 Still showing the way Page 27 Lex Page 24 www ft com/transport,2
1998-04-02, From Mr Arjun Mittal Sir Your report of the resignation of the industry minister in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh Asia-Pacific News Digest March 30 reflects the FT's unfavourable view of the new Indian administration Surely the government's desire to deregulate the Indian economy to roll back unnecessary bureaucracy and to encourage foreign investment in infrastructure is more important than the resignation of a minister who does not even belong to the central government The FT has previously quoted BJP politicians' nationalist economic views as if they represented party policy This they no more do than some Labour backbenchers reflect the UK government's policy on for example welfare reform The FT it appears has pre-judged the new government and is giving foreign investors an unreasonably gloomy impression of India ,3
2002-06-19, Home & away Mitt Romney hailed by many in the country for having saved the Winter Olympics from financial disaster was given a hero's welcome when he returned home to Massachusetts earlier this spring Popular support for the multi-millionaire swelled so fast that Jane Swift acting governor was tearfully forced to back out of the gubernatorial race giving Romney a place on the Republican ballot Now Romney's three-year stint in Salt Lake City is coming back to haunt him thanks to an arcane Massachusetts law that requires candidates reside in the state for seven consecutive years before the election More than two centuries ago the state's citizens decided a strict residency rule would be the best way of blocking politicians sympathetic to the English Crown  Democrats are now challenging Romney's candidacy on residency grounds In most states such an absence would not be an issue Hillary Clinton for instance declared herself a New York resident shortly before launching her Senate campaign Democrats say Romney's long-term ties to the state except for the brief spell in Utah he has lived in Massachusetts for 30 years do not matter One would think getting a Democratic governor elected in a largely Democratic state would be more straightforward ,3
2002-06-27, The news from Mexicodoes not look good for the international investors who poured money into its stock market earlier this year A sharp fall in the peso has combined with a slump in stock prices to produce a loss of about 27 per cent in dollar terms since mid-April Perhaps more alarmingly this cannot simply be attributed to contagion from the other economies in Latin America The sudden fall is almost entirely due to Mexico's own domestic problems and to contagion from a different source the US Capital flows in and out of Mexico and the Mexican economy itself are so tightly linked to the US that American problems are magnified south of the border In January Mexico's links to the US helped prompt international credit rating agencies to give Mexico's sovereign debt investment grade rewarding years of tight fiscal and monetary policy According to JP Morgan spreads on Mexican government bonds over US Treasuries swiftly declined to 227 basis points having been slightly over 300 at the turn of the year The upgrades sparked a rally in the country's stock market By mid-April the IPC the market's main benchmark index had reached 7574 a gain of almost 20 per cent for the year The peso strengthened to just less than 9 to the dollar But since the dollar and the US stock markets started their slide spreads have returned to 327 higher than before the upgrade The IPC has fallen 18 per cent hitting 6226 in early trading yesterday 150 points below where it started the year while the peso yesterday exceeded 10 to the dollar for the first time in more than two years Government bond yields jumped more than 100 basis points at this week's auction on fears that the low peso would translate into higher inflation It's almost entirely an American game says Geoffrey Dennis chief Latin American equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney who pointed out that recent figures on Mexican consumer spending and exports suggested the economy was recovering There is also no sign yet that the weaker peso has produced higher inflation I have a lot of problems with people who view this as a case of the US economy is in trouble so let's sell the peso  Arturo Espinosa stock market analyst with Grupo Financiero Santander Serfin in Mexico City points to Mexico's current low valuations as a reason to enter the market now The IPC he says is valued at about 7 times fair value which represents a 15 per cent discount to the average multiple for the market over the last five years With the Mexican economy in relative good health and reduced borrowing costs for larger companies this seems to indicate a buying opportunity Further the IPC is trading at a price-earnings ratio of about 10 for this year's expected earnings against an equivalent figure for the Dow Jones Industrial Average of about 19 times He suggests that earnings forecasts for the year will come down somewhat after Mexico's biggest companies reveal the exchange losses they have suffered during the current quarter However the disparity in valuation looks attractive to anyone who might be prepared to bet on a US recovery Several of Mexico's most solid companies now appear to be oversold They include Walmex the Mexican offshoot of Wal-Mart which is trading at $21 59 having reached $27 67 in early April and Soriana another strong Mexican retailer which has fallen from $33 67 to $24 40 since early May Mexico's conglomerates which should be made more competitive by the lower peso have also suffered despite in many cases using the lower spreads earlier this year to clean up their balance sheets For example Vitro one of the world's biggest glass makers yesterday stood at 10 31 pesos down from 14 1 pesos a month ago while Grupo Alfa had slipped from 21 20 to 15 85 over roughly the same period For anybody wanting to make a leveraged bet on a US recovery investing in Mexico may be a good way to do it ,2
2002-06-13, Tom Bailey co-founder of the problem-hit US mutual fund group Janus has quit as chief executive 33 years after he set up the business His resignation comes amid investor dissatisfaction over billions of dollars of losses in Janus funds It follows job cuts last year and a management reshuffle to try to improve the sixth largest US fund's performance The departure of Mr Bailey 64 from the top spot came amid tensions with Stillwell the parent of Janus who bought Mr Bailey's remaining 12 per cent stake in the company last year Janus once a market darling with big bets on technology stocks in the 1990s has been under intense pressure to improve profits after its assets lost more than half of their value At April 30 they totalled $115bn against $230bn two years ago Its mutual funds have fallen sharply in the past 12 months in a bear equities market down 23 per cent and below an 18 per cent slide in the benchmark Standard & Poor's index Disgruntled investors withdrew more than $12bn from Janus's stock and bond mutual funds last year according to Boston-based Financial Research Corp Shares in Stillwell have fallen more than 40 per cent this year Yesterday they fell 28 cents by the close in New York to $19 28 Stillwell said a five person committee would manage the Denver-based fund company during the search for a new chief executive Mr Bailey would continue to work with the trustees to serve shareholder interests focusing mainly on reviewing and monitoring fund performance it said ,2
2002-04-22, Near the peak of the great late 20th century bull market many US investors discovered a kind of alchemy that turned a cosmetic piece of corporate legerdemain -the stock split into gold As share prices ballooned growth companies found themselves in the awkward position of having shares that appeared to be expensive to the ordinary investor just because their cover price was heading for three figures The simple stock split was the solution In the three years from 1996-1998 there were 2200 stock splits By 1999 even solid blue-chips such as General Electric International Business Machines and AT&T were doing it Splits have no effect on the value of the underlying company Acme Hi-Tech Inc with 1bn shares outstanding at $100 each is worth the same after it doubles its outstanding issue to 2bn shares each trading at $50 But academics worked out that the shares of companies that announced a split were outperforming the market in the 12 months following the announcement possibly because the move was only made when management was sure the shares would rise Of course as it turned out shares in many of the most aggressive splitters were expensive but the price-tag had nothing to do with it Split or no split the underlying company was simply worth much less than investors believed Now that many former high-flying stocks are trading at below $10 companies face the opposite challenge As Credit Suisse First Boston CSFB points out in a recent study many institutional stock screens and quantitative models ignore stocks that have a price below $5 while brokers may charge additional payment for low-priced stocks The nearer the stock drifts to $1 the more likely they get bracketed as penny shares fodder for day-traders' short-term speculation and below $1 there is the very real risk of delisting by the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq The solution is the clumsily but accurately named reverse stock split And the mother of all reverse splits is about to take place a one-for-five stock-merge by none other than AT&T Ma Bell's proposal made in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing 10 days ago has a certain logic Although the telecommunications group's stock traded at more than $15 before the announcement analysts estimate the price could slip as low as $5 once it merges its cable television business with Comcast at the end of this year That is perilously close to such washed up former telecoms stars as Lucent Technologies $4 50 at last Thursday's close and Nortel Networks $4 04 But although the cosmetic effect should be to give the slimmed down company a higher list price the same academics who mapped out the positive effect of stock splits point out that AT&T runs the opposite risk Indeed AT&T's shares traded lower in the two days after the announcement falling 11 per cent before bouncing back That's consistent with the idea that it's a signal of weakness says David Ikenberry professor of finance at Rice University Managers are conveying that they don't think the stock price is going to increase  CSFB's analysis of 800 reverse splits in the past five years published before the AT&T announcement appears to confirm the hunch that reverse stock-splitters are simply putting off bad news Their shares underperformed sector peers both in the short and the long-term The relative solidity of AT&T compared with Acme Hi-Tech and its like may be no protection Companies with higher absolute price levels at the time of the reverse split do not fare better than penny stocks employing the same tactics the research says That may be why so few large companies attempt the manoeuvre 7-Eleven the convenience store chain was the last big US corporation to carry out a reverse split also a one-for-five announced in March 2000 Its shares took a beating in the 12 months that followed Under the circumstances it might be safer for investors and managers to follow the no-split policy of such bright investment sparks as Warren Buffett The A-shares of Berkshire Hathaway Buffett's investment company trade at an eye-watering $71000 each Delisting it is safe to say is not one of those things that his shareholders have to worry about andrew hill@ft com,2

1998-04-03, Ford Motor has sealed the first big contract for its new Belarus assembly plant with a $3m deal to supply 1500 Transit minibuses for transport in Moscow The agreement comes as a relief for the Belarus operation after the plant opened last July was forced to halve output in October when unexpected customs problems virtually halted exports to Russia Russia and Belarus have agreed a customs union and the new plant was created as Ford's first step to serve the potentially huge Russian market Since starting production about 400 of the 430 Transit vans and Escort cars assembled from kits in Belarus have been sold in Russia Neil Campbell general director of Ford's plant in Minsk said he hoped the removal of the customs hitches would allow the plant to return to its full single-shift capacity of about 32 vehicles a day or about 6800 a year Len Meany Ford's associate director for new markets said that if Ford met its sales aims the next step would be to double output levels by adding a second shift in early 1999 and potentially moving the full body and paint facilities in three years The company has so far recruited 12 dealers in Russia and hopes to increase that to 25 by the end of this year Apart from Belarus-sourced vehicles the outlets also sell cars imported directly from Ford's factories in Europe and the US The Minsk plant is virtually identical to the Ford unit at Plonsk in Poland opened nearly two years ago Ford has shied away from building big greenfield factories or setting up joint ventures with large existing manufacturers in the region in favour of much smaller kit-assembly plants which could be expanded as local markets and components supplies improve Mr Campbell said he hoped to raise the local content of the Belarus-assembled vehicles as more suppliers moved into the region Local content in Poland has risen sharply Ford is pressing on with plans to invest at least $250m in a much bigger manufacturing joint venture near St Petersburg The unit located at the Russky Dizel works at Vsevolovsk about 30km from the city could build up to 150000 vehicles a year Details of the scheme have yet to be finalised Like other western manufacturers with plans in the region Ford is awaiting Russia's final passage this week of its new decree on motor manufacturing joint ventures ,1

2002-06-29, The rescue of classical 18th century Hadzor Hall in Worcestershire empty and abandoned for five years can now go ahead thanks to a property developer Neil Grinnall Hadzor a beautiful Greek-revival stately home has been altered by successive owners for the past 70 years not to mention suffering from large Victorian additions Next month though this troubled period will end with a bang when Grinnall gives the signal for explosives to be detonated For the former oil-rig roustabout and market trader who has been a property developer for 15 years intends removing an austere three-storey office block that was attached to the gracious house in the 1960s by its then owners the Society for the Divine Word It's an eyesore and I'm going to return the hall to its original 18th century state Grinnall says The block was used as a religious seminary and more recently as a research and development centre by Micropore International which has sold the hall the office block stables and outbuildings and 54 acres of rural woodland to Grinnall for £3m More conventional developers than Grinnall might have converted the office block into flats Thirty dwellings could have been coaxed from the 3600 sq metres of space there Grinnall's architect Ian Ritchie believes And the house itself more than 9000 sq metres could have provided yet more scope for flats However Grinnall who has admired the house from afar for 20 years has other plans He intends living in it himself But not before he has removed such impurities as the late Victorian servants' quarters which comprise about a third of the floor area Grinnall's developments are usually commercial properties or executive detached houses with five or six bedrooms in quiet Midlands enclaves selling for about £400000 He lives in one of these himself and his move to Hadzor after it has been refurbished at a cost of £1m will involve him in an entirely different lifestyle with a butler and housekeeper to look after him and run the house Removing the clutter of the office block and the Victorian additions will in effect return Hadzor Hall to the way it appeared in the 1780s It will be a spacious elegant eight-bedroom home approved alike by conservationists architectural purists and local planners The planners have also approved the use of the former Micropore International car parks with room for 300 vehicles as building land for up to 60 town houses These have been designed to fit into courtyard clusters in the style of the red-brick Victorian stable block The three- and four-bedroom houses will sell for between £200000 and £350000 and the whole scheme Grinnall says will be worth £25m when it is completed in 2004 The house was deteriorating because it had been empty for years I think a lot of people looked at it but they couldn't decide how to handle it mostly because of that ugly 1960s office block At one stage we considered turning the hall into flats but I couldn't let that happen to such a beautiful house It would have spoiled too many wonderfully proportioned rooms Then someone suggested demolishing the office block and building in the carpark After that it was plain sailing except for a few local protestors who actually wanted the office block to remain What we will have done is to return Hadzor Hall to the way it was in 1779 when it was rebuilt except that inside I'm going to have a cinema upstairs for me and my children plenty of bathrooms and a garage and a swimming pool  As a former Olympic swimming trialist who still works out with amateur boxers and weightlifters boys' stuff as he calls it 39-year-old Grinnall is clearly delighted with his latest venture as is his company Neil Grinnall Homes of Stourport Worcestershire which is financed by City of London bankers Dunbar and Heritable & General Nobody wanted to know about Hadzor until I bought it now people are queueing up to make me offers he says Grinnall is considering one offer of £3 4m for a 40 per cent share of the new houses at Hadzor Hall which when you recall the price he paid would make the venture self-liquidating Hadzor Hall receives complimentary notices from Sir Nikolaus Pevsner in his Buildings of England  The house is Grade II listed and when Grinnall's work is complete it would be recognised by visiting ghosts of the Galton banking family of Birmingham who owned it in the late 18th century Ghosts Grinnall claims he has seen one in the Hadzor library It was a friendly cheerful spirit he says ,1

2002-06-05, The ownership ofRHM the old Ranks Hovis McDougall is once again in question Ironically the company that spent much of the 1980s desperately trying to remain independent may soon change hands for the third time in a decade And a business once regarded as stodgy and mature with its bread and grocery brand emphasis could be seen as a desirable property After all it still has a range of famous brands from Hovis bread through Mr Kipling Cadbury's and Lyons cakes Robertson's jams Bisto gravy powder Paxo stuffings and Sharwoods sauces Doughty Hanson the private equity group that bought RHM in 2000 has hired Credit Suisse First Boston to examine strategic options It paid £1 139bn for the business less than two years ago That suggests it would want about £1 5bn A flotation would return the business to the public arena which it left in 1992 when it was acquired by Tomkins then a conglomerate for £935m After 10 years in private hands potential investors in RHM know relatively little about how the business has been performing Some clues can be gleaned from data given to holders of £650m of bonds issued last year by RHM Foodbrands to refinance part of the debt associated with Doughty Hanson's acquisition Profits in this subsidiary which includes most of the best known brand names in its milling and baking frozen bread cake and grocery businesses have been dull recently despite growth in the bread business In the 1980s RHM had been the target of a series of potential bidders with a near 30 per cent shareholding being bandied from one party to another While that was happening RHM's profits were rising sharply reaching a peak of more than £175m in the late 1980s Once the stake was placed in 1991 profits and the share price collapsed giving Tomkins its chance to swoop The year Tomkins took control RHM's operating profits were £93m When it sold eight years later profits were £153m One executive who was at RHM during the Tomkins years says The Tomkins takeover was good for RHM The break with the past allowed change to take place The production-led culture was replaced by a customer-focused one Tomkins imposed financial disciplines They shook millions of pounds out of the balance sheet cut costs and improved productivity RHM abandoned its global ambitions and cleared out the dross such as the mushroom growing business while developing new activities And Tomkins backed Paul Wilkinson to make all the changes necessary at British Bakeries  Mr Wilkinson now chairman and chief executive of RHM had joined the company in 1988 after a 20-year career in the consumer goods industry Tomkins put him in charge of British Bakeries the bread-making business Under him and his successors the bakeries were rationalised and investment was put in to make them low-cost producers Premium brands have been developed The Hovis brand has been rejuvenated with the launch last year of Hovis Crusty Sharp sales volume increases mean RHM now claims market leadership in the premium bread sector As well as the brands RHM has built the business links such as those with M&S McDonald's and Pizza Hut which make for long-term relationships and thus more stable and predictable earnings When at the end of the 1990s Tomkins was put under pressure to rationalise its businesses it put RHM up for sale Doughty Hanson the buyer said it would build the business But RHM like others in the sector has been unable to pick up businesses at reasonable prices For instance in the recent auction of Nestle's ambient grocery brands RHM is believed to have made an offer of £80m-£90m far short of the £135m bid by Hicks Muse Tate & Furst With such high prices in fashion Doughty Hanson might be able to engineer a trade sale But Tomkins was unable to find a trade buyer prepared to pay enough only two years ago and Doughty Hanson will want more now Further RHM has a poison pill that would deter a break-up bid its pension fund would require a buyer to put hundreds of millions of pounds into it according to one analyst A financial buyer would have to be convinced that it could in turn generate a private equity style return of at least a 30 per cent per annum on its investment Should RHM return to the stock market it would according to David Lang analyst at Investec need to demonstrate good visibility of growth and a decent dividend to attract investors Its financial structure would need to be revised And it would have to assure investors that the disciplines instilled in the past 10 years would not be thrown away with a reversion to the short-termism RHM displayed in the previous 10 ,1

2002-04-12, Listening closeness tenderness succour love the men of French politics are playing at being mother In place of the traditional masculine discourse the presidential election campaign is rife with the female buzzwords of benevolence France's rulers no longer dare to rule infantilised citizens expect the state to provide everything Power is separated from authority and it has changed sex too losing its paternal and masculine tone True the face of French politics is still predominately male But the relative scarcity of female leaders obscures a profound shift in the nature of power France has ended up with a Mother State presiding over a society of children Where we might ask are the fathers In business perhaps Capitalism is frequently seen as a patriarchy in which the overwhelmingly male composition of most boardrooms is seemingly set in stone But that perception is mistaken The traditional pyramid of hierarchy is giving way to management via networks compassion is taught to entrepreneurs who no longer want to describe themselves as bosses So are fathers to be found in government Apparently not Most of the policies pursued by Lionel Jospin's red-green coalition follow this maternal vision of the Republic Consider today's burning political issues sex equality conciliation with Corsican separatists an end to military conscription laws strengthening a defendant's presumption of innocence In the workplace France has introduced a 35-hour working week jobs-first policies universal health cover youth employment schemes In social policy there are state-subsidised festivals and street parties same-sex marriages a choice between maternal and paternal family name and a strengthening of the laws on sexual harassment and prostitution The pathological bond between citizen and state has become like the unhealthily interdependent ties found sometimes between mother and child People in rural areas residents of regions such as Corsica or the overseas territories that receive government hand-outs television producers protected by quotas artists and performers entitled to grants and other benefits all as groups or individuals increasingly depend on the state French companies also rely on subsidies and government contracts And let us not forget the 3m people entirely or partially supported by social security payouts Everyone and everything in France sees the state as a nurturing and bountiful mother who will forgive their failings As Alexis de Tocqueville once feared it saves them the trouble of thinking for themselves and from the burden of making their own way in life The state has moved beyond the functions of authority defence and of helping to solve internal conflict in part through the redistribution of wealth Instead it has allowed itself to become an all-powerful and all-bountiful mother figure This amounts to abuse The state's role in maintaining and developing society becomes suffocating when it is overly protective It even causes neurosis not so much Big Brother is watching you but rather Big Mother is watching over you The citizen can easily regress into infancy But is it really necessary to relieve the individual of all autonomy and treat him or her simply as a victim of social conditions What responsibility rests with the citizen Since the industrial unrest of 1995 when there was a huge demand for workers' privileges and rights to be safeguarded no French politician has dared to argue for a smaller state Political leaders left and right are united in their support for the expansion of the state into every nook and cranny of society The result is a depressive mental disorder even a regressive one For as experts on family relationships will tell you an over-solicitous mother undermines her offspring's independence Yet the dominating maternal role of the French state is avoidable Britain under Tony Blair has rejigged its approach to redistribution placing greater responsibility on benefit claimants Despite unification Gerhard Schroder's Germany has modernised its state and reduced the fiscal burden Even Italy under a centre-left coalition managed a budgetary and administrative reform Socialists are not always statists Across Europe redistribution of wealth is linked to work public spending is capped savings and private initiative encouraged Everywhere but in France a smaller more efficient public sector is replacing the bloated impotent and profligate state machine Why does France alone still cultivate an all-encompassing state Big Mother promises everything to everyone When will she content herself with merely contributing to the country's wellbeing The writer is a Parisian psychoanalyst and author of Big Mother the psycho-pathology of political life Odile Jacob {XEU}24 50,3

2002-06-14, The battered telecoms equipment industry faced renewed calls yesterday for a drastic overhaul potentially including mergers as Lucent Technologies admitted that its revenues were once again in free fall The company's concession put paid to any lingering hopes that the worst was over for the big equipment makers sending shares in rivals such as Nortel Networks and Alcatel lower Lucent had promised that the first three months of this year would turn out to be the bottom for the equipment industry which has been hit by the rout among the telecoms companies that buy their products Yesterday however it admitted that revenues were still falling and were now likely to be 10-15 per cent lower in the current quarter than the preceding three months At only $3bn-$3 2bn that will leave the company's quarterly revenues even further below the target of $4bn that it set recently for returning to break-even The continuing slide echoes a warning last month from Nortel which cut its latest quarterly revenue forecast to around $2 75bn well below its own break-even target of $3 2bn Jeff Lipton senior analyst at JP Morgan said the continuing slide had made mergers among the biggest networking equipment companies more likely They are at the point now where it is hard to lay off additional people without handicapping the business he said At the end of the day there are probably going to be two or three companies  Others said that Lucent could continue to slash jobs and other costs if necessary through a broader restructuring than the one that is under way You are still talking about a rather large business with multiple business lines said Ted Jackson senior analyst at USB Piper Jaffray Lucent said it had been forced by the latest slide in its revenues to renegotiate the covenants on its bank credit facility keeping open its access to cash the second time it has had to amend the covenants in less than a year The company said it would still meet the terms of the bank deal if it declined to a loss of $350m in ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation in the current quarter compared with an earlier covenant that foresaw a loss of $50m Rather than an ebitda profit of $250m in the first quarter of its next fiscal year the covenants now foresee a loss of $300m it added ,2
2002-06-28, Anders Fogh Rasmussen has a secret plan to get EU leaders to hammer out a deal on expanding the EU The Danish prime minister has booked Copenhagen's Bella conference centre for four days in December and is prepared to keep them there for as long as it takes The Copenhagen summit the climax of enlargement negotiations with 10 countries is supposed to last only two days But everybody knows that the meeting will be a potentially bloody and protracted affair perhaps going through the night in an attempt to get the deal which Mr Fogh Rasmussen calls the EU's historic mission Sometimes politicians need a deadline he said I hope we can wrap up everything in two days but we have a booking for four days just in case he told the Financial Times Mr Fogh Rasmussen prime minister for just seven months will take over the EU presidency on Monday putting Denmark in the driving seat to conclude an enlargement process it helped to start in Copenhagen in 1993 If it goes right final negotiations will be completed in Copenhagen paving the way for 10 countries mainly from former communist eastern Europe to join the EU in time for the European parliament elections of 2004 Mr Fogh Rasmussen a dapper 49-year-old economist says he is optimistic But he knows there is scope for a spectacular political pile up in the last few weeks of the year leaving enlargement in jeopardy By the time the new German government is fully established towards the end of October there will be just six weeks for full-blooded negotiations before the Copenhagen summit starts on December 12 Into that time frame one has to throw the dispute over EU farm and regional subsidies and the possibility that the Irish might reject for a second time the Nice treaty As if that was not enough the Danes also have to contend with one of Europe's most intractable problems Cyprus which is in line to join the EU reunited or not Turkey waits on the sidelines demanding its own date for accession talks It is with this on his mind that Mr Fogh Rasmussen has already started some tough talking Yesterday he made his clearest warning yet to Germany Britain and others not to jeopardise the expansion of the EU by fighting over farm spending Calling on EU member states to honour the promises they made to bring former communist bloc countries into the EU he urged members to stop counting the cost of expansion Mr Fogh Rasmussen said there would be huge disappointment among the 10 candidate countries from eastern and southern Europe if enlargement was delayed There would be a serious political economic and social backlash he said We have an historic and moral obligation to deliver on our promises If there is even a short delay and we do not get an agreement at Copenhagen that could lead to a long postponement of enlargement he said Can you imagine the disappointment if after Copenhagen we said 'Sorry you can't join the EU because we can't agree on agricultural policy' Some argue it is impossible for small countries to take on such a mammoth task that they lack the clout to strike deals with big protagonists such as France or Germany But Mr Fogh Rasmussen takes the opposite view We will not be pursuing Danish national interests he said arguing that Denmark could be a broker between the bigger member states While big countries treat the EU presidency as an additional burden Denmark like other smaller countries is virtually putting national government on hold to concentrate on European business We hope to show even a small country is able to make a difference Mr Fogh Rasmussen said It is a very important signal to other countries in Europe Civil service holidays have been cancelled and the Danish opposition has agreed to work parliamentary business around EU council meetings It's no sleep till Copenhagen said one official ruefully About 80 per cent of my time will be spent on EU matters says Mr Fogh Rasmussen We consider it a national interest that we make it an effective presidency ,3
2002-06-07, Studies show that passive investing through indexes beats active stockpicking most of the time But despite the evidence more than 90 per cent of mutual-fund investments are in active rather than index funds the most common type of passive investments Pension funds and university endowments have successfully used passive investing and index funds since they were introduced in the 1970s There is relatively little incentive however for financial services firms to promote passive investing as it does not generate the fees associated with active investment vehicles Many index funds charge 0 2 per cent while according to Morningstar the mutual fund research firm the average expense ratio of actively managed US stock mutual funds is 1 45 per cent Predictably perhaps much less information is available on passive investments such as index and exchange traded funds There are however a handful of websites that aim to educate and inform investors about passive investing One of the best starting points is About com's mutual fund pages http//mutualfunds about com/cs/indexfunds which lists some useful links although some are old Morningstar www morningstar com lists and ranks 109 index funds including the Vanguard Group's www van guard com huge family of index funds that cover most investment categories The subscription-based Morningstar service also has an excellent section on its website devoted to exchange traded funds However probably the best site for investors seeking information on both index and exchange-traded funds is IndexFunds' site www indexfunds com  As the name implies this website is devoted entirely to index funds and EFTs and includes an extensive information section designed to help visitors learn about the basics and types of index funds Visitors can also browse interviews some a little dated with index fund experts such as John Bogle the former chairman of the Vanguard Group someone who is widely considered to be the father of index investing The site also includes a homepage link to the ETFzone a section that is devoted to information and statistics about exchange traded funds including for example a top 10 list of the largest ETF's by assets Other sections of the site include an active bulletin board where visitors can exchange views and ask questions and perhaps most importantly a data section with an index index fund and EFT screening tool enabling users to select funds based on a wide range of criteria ,2
2002-06-18, A year and a half on the private equity deal drought continues And despite signs that the market is opening up investors appear to be getting desperate Brand Services a medium-sized industrial scaffolding company recently attracted between 30 and 40 bidders for the first round of its auction In the second round that number was reduced to about 12 On the face of it the deal looks appealing The company is in good shape and because Brand puts up most of its scaffolding around oil refineries and chemical plants its busiest period is during an economic downturn when reduced business flows allow the plants to focus on factory upkeep The deal is also in the sweet spot of the buy-out market At about $500m in size it is small enough for middle-sized buy-out firms and big enough to make a difference to a large buy-out firm Other middle-sized auctions are also understood to be attracting substantial interest That said it is difficult to see Brand Services being a big money maker for anyone It is being sold by Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity group which has owned the company for years and is likely to generate a substantial return from the sale While it will doubtless be smart enough to leave something on the table for the next owner that something will not be a mountain of money The company is not the first to attract a healthy number of bidders Of the mega-deals that have recently been floated including the sale of Qwest's yellow pages business Diageo's sale of its Burger King division and Tyco's failed sale of its plastics division all attracted attention from a number of buyers About $120bn of committed buy-out money is waiting to deployed according to Thomson Financial's Venture Economics Meanwhile the buy-out firms charge their increasingly impatient clients management fees In the venture world similar pressure caused by a $100bn overhang is forcing a growing number of firms to reduce their fees or cut the size of their funds Buy-out deals tend to be far larger than venture deals so the buy-out overhang should disappear far faster Even so the venture world's experience is a warning shot for the buy-out industry Many buy-out firms will not participate in auctions because of the difficulty of getting a decent price Even so many of the biggest names in the industry including the Blackstone Group the Carlyle Group Credit Suisse First Boston Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Thomas H Lee Partners and Texas Pacific Group were involved in one or usually more of the large auctions Four of those firms have recently raised buy-out funds of more than $5bn Now they need something to do with those funds Despite the intense competition the firms had one good reason for believing those deals might still be lucrative distress Qwest and Tyco need to sell divisions to reduce mountains of debt Burger King needs massive capital investments to get its business back on track Tough economic times have in the past forced sellers to unload many of their assets In the last recession investors such as Leon Black and Sam Zell made fortunes by picking up cheap assets This time around however the mountain of money in the wings means that no one is likely to find many bargains Even David Rubenstein a founder and managing director of Carlyle which has participated in some of the auctions recently said that it was not clear that today's highly competitive auctions would generate healthy returns One piece of good news for the private equity industry is that none of the other professional investors are making much money Equity managers are fighting another year of steady declines Bonds are unlikely to prosper now that the Federal Reserve seems to have finished easing interest rates Even the rocket-fuelled hedge fund industry is scrambling to make a few per cent out of lacklustre markets That means that even if private equity returns fall as most private equity investors assume they will they should at least have a fairly low hurdle to beat to retain investors' interest Being the best of a bad lot is not what the private equity industry expected six or nine months ago however Then some managers were predicting a new golden age for buy-out investing Some said that September 11 had rid the market of its last illusions knocking it into a short recession that would swiftly be reversed by tax cuts and war-time defence spending Since then the economy has been hit by a wave of corporate scandals starting with Enron and more recently Imclone that have not produced the divestitures buy-out firms hope to benefit from And more importantly they have cast a lengthening cloud over US capitalism which calls into doubt even an anaemic economic recovery That is bad news for private equity and bad news for everyone else ,1
2002-06-01, From Mr Adam Mikkelsen Sir The low point of FT Weekend is invariably the tired socialism served up week after week by Michael Prowse Two weeks ago Why Europe must remain true to its own ideals he was US-bashing as usual pointing out that 1 per cent of Americans own 34 per cent of the wealth the suggestion being that were the government to take more of the top 1 per cent's money and spread it around America would be a far better place ie more like Europe But this statistic is pointless and misleading Absolute not relative incomes are important in assessing standards of living Provided the remaining 99 per cent have a higher income than they would in another society how are they disadvantaged This outsize ownership would only be a problem in a static economic system in which one person's gain is another's loss and wealth persists across multiple generations But this clearly is not the case in the US The vast majority of the richest people in America have made their money themselves and a large proportion of them are from first- or second-generation immigrant families The massive wealth of Bill Gates Larry Ellison and Warren Buffett is the result of their holding large stakes in corporations that they started from nothing corporations that have added immensely to the growth of the US economy on which all Americans directly or indirectly rely for their financial security Furthermore each of these individuals can consume only so much At the end of the day the only thing each of them can do with their money is keep it in the ownership of their companies invest it in other productive enterprises or give it away to charity Mr Gates's medical foundation is the largest private donor in the world Mr Buffett plans to give away his entire fortune to charity on his death I fail to see how the more equitable distribution of wealth favoured by Mr Prowse would serve the interests of US society He could not seriously suggest that the state could allocate capital as productively as a Warren Buffett Therefore why not let him keep it And would future Microsofts Oracles and Berkshire Hathaways now all powerhouses of the US economy even exist under a punitive tax regime Entrepreneurs would inevitably be put off starting enterprises if they knew the bulk of their gains were to be taken from them The 1 per cent/34 per cent statistic is a sign of the relatively free society that still exists in the US The very reason the US economy continues to be the most dynamic in the world and the very reason immigrants such as myself choose to live here is that it is not like Europe Confiscating wealth to spread it around may have an idealistic appeal to socialists such as Mr Prowse but in the long run it would make us all poorer in every sense of the word Adam Mikkelsen Newport Beach CA 92661 US,3

2002-06-21, Another rather half-hearted attempt at a mid-morning rally in London equities came to nothing yesterday as a TMT-led slide prompted a third consecutive retreat by the market And that slide saw the FTSE 100 index London's benchmark slide below the 4600 level with dealers increasingly fearing that market bears will now attempt to drive the index towards its September 21 low of 4433 7 The FTSE 100 ended the day another 72 1 lower at 4580 3 for a three-day decline of 176 5 or 3 7 per cent while the FTSE 250 lost 76 5 to 5549 5 and the FTSE SmallCap 21 0 to 2376 4 The Techmark 100's humiliation showed no signs of abating that index slipping a further 11 31 to yet another record low of 868 49 The latest pressure on the market was prompted by various factors both domestic and overseas Wall Street finished the Wednesday's overnight session under fire again And a further slide at the outset of US trading yesterday after a flurry of economic data did nothing to bolster flagging sentiment in London and other European markets Adding to the gloom surrounding the TMTs was an uninspiring trading update from Nokia the world's biggest mobile phone manufacturer the latest competition proposals from Oftel the telecoms regulator and another round of job cuts at Reuters the media group As well as the TMTs the insurance stocks came under renewed fire reflecting investors' concerns about solvency margins in the industry Traders said it was the fear that the insurance companies had already been switching out of equities and into gilts and would continue to do so in the future to maintain their solvency ratios that had been instrumental in driving the equity market lower recently There was plenty of economic news and data to keep the market busy Pressure on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to increase interest rates after its next meeting scheduled for July 3-4 eased again after surprisingly weak retail sales data for May That showed sales had fallen 0 6 per cent during the month the weakest since February 2000 Combined with the low RPI-X number already released it is favourable for our call of no change to rates in July said the global economics team at ING Financial Markets Today brings the potential for substantial swings in the market as FTSE 100 index options and the FTSE future expire simultaneously around 10 30am Before the expires the football World Cup quarter final match between England and Brazil which kicks off at 7 30am is expected to see brokers either cancel or bring forward their morning meetings Stock market activity is expected to be minimal until the game finishes Turnover in equities was 2 5bn shares ,2
2002-04-29, For years the enemies of Sir Richard Branson have argued that his empire is as full of hot air as the balloons he used to fly around the world News that he is planning to float eight companies from his Virgin empire will do nothing to quieten critics who argue his Virgin empire is in crisis and needs that kind of money to survive The moves to be implemented over the next eight years could add up to £2bn to the £1 3bn that Sir Richard has raised in the past three years from whole and partial trade sales Sir Richard's critics say his empire's problems have come to a head this year with virtually all of his companies including stalwart cash cow Virgin Atlantic now lossmaking However Virgin insists the truth is very different While admitting only Virgin Rail Virgin Active the health club business and V2 the music label will make profits this year it claims this doesn't matter Richard doesn't need a cash cow any more He has the money to cushion the empire says Will Whitehorn Sir Richard's right-hand man and a fellow director of several Virgin enterprises Sir Richard estimates the size of that cushion held through a tax-efficient structure of holding companies worldwide at less then half a billion pounds In addition he boasts personal wealth of about £1bn from his Virgin equity stakes plus a further £600m-£700m of liquid assets By next year Mr Whitehorn predicts Virgin companies should be generating aggregate earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation of £390m on sales of £5 8bn So why the planned flurry of floats and cash generation Sir Richard dismisses the perennial speculation that his empire is full of black holes and is on the verge of collapse If I carried on expanding at the rate I have been that could well become the case But Virgin works by investing in developing assets and generating profits from selling others when they mature he says In recent years the way of doing that often very lucratively has been to bring in partners The group's biggest coup in 1999 was to persuade Singapore Airlines to part with £550m for a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic But as those partners start seeking exits Sir Richard will have to accept serial flotation Despite his fury 15 years ago when Virgin Group was so castigated by the City during its two-year flirtation with public company status he claims now to be sanguine about the prospect We've matured I have personally and so has the group  The first of the floats pencilled in for the first quarter of next year will be Virgin Blue the Australian airline which Goldman Sachs the company's adviser believes could be worth up to A$1 5bn £550m In a model that is likely to be replicated in the rest of Virgin's listings 20-30 per cent of Virgin Blue is slated for flotation on the Australian Stock Exchange Sir Richard is also considering cutting his 50 per cent stake to between 30 or 35 per cent Virgin's other partners such as T-Mobile Stagecoach and Brigdepoint the venture capitalists are likely to push for similar floats many of them in London Sir Richard will invest the money he raises abroad His US mobile phone joint venture with Sprint his biggest start-up yet is absorbing an initial investment of $162m £112 5m That will lay the foundation especially among younger Americans for building the Virgin brand in the US he explains But that is just the start There will be more international phone ventures Megastores and cinemas and a global roll-out of Virgin credit cards Sir Richard says everything now is designed to put Virgin on the same brand footing globally as the likes of Coca Cola and Microsoft Back home he aims to curb his impetuosity to launch niche start-ups In addition and providing the government's planned capital gains tax reforms come to fruition he will bring his holding companies onshore by 2004 With the sprawling empire contained holding companies back onshore and the biggest operating companies publicly listed more light than ever promises to be shone on the true state of the Virgin empire ,2
2002-06-13, Jan Kavan the Czech foreign minister yesterday warned the EU's decision this week to postpone debate on the financing of the union's eastward enlargement could cause problems for the accession process Mr Kavan said yesterday that if the 15 members did not make up their minds by October there would be a major problem If we don't have a solution in early 2003 and if we don't join in early 2004 we will have difficulties with participating in the European parliamentary elections the inter-government council and in budget discussions he said Mr Kavan was commenting on the decision by EU foreign ministers to put off detailed discussion about the financial aspects of enlargement including farm subsidies until after the German elections He said as long as the EU made its decisions between October and November the accession negotiations could still be completed as planned The Czech Republic is one of 10 countries bidding to join the EU in 2004 While the candidates have completed negotiations on most entry conditions discussions on the financial questions still lay ahead Mr Kavan was speaking during an election rally of his Social Democrat party Czechs go to the polls tomorrow and Saturday in parliamentary elections They must decide between giving the Social Democrats another term or bringing back to power the right-of-centre ODS ,3
2002-04-12, Dresdner Bank could come under pressure to make additional risk provisions amid doubts over its ability to recover collateral on loans to the troubled Kirch media group Bankers and analysts said yesterday that Germany's third-biggest bank could face a court battle over whether its {XEU}460m $406m loan to Kirch was fully secured by the media group's 25 per cent stake in Telecinco the Spanish broadcaster Leading Kirch creditors HVB Group Commerzbank DZ Bank and Bayerische Landesbank are disputing Dresdner's full claim to the Telecinco stake on the grounds that the contract securing the collateral was signed less than three months before insolvency There must be a 5050 chance that Dresdner will not get its hands on all the Telecinco stake said Carsten Zielke of WestLB In such circumstances it would be prudent for the bank to make provisions against potential Kirch loan losses said Mr Zielke So far they haven't done so  But Bernd Fahrholz Dresdner Bank chairman insisted again yesterday at the bank's annual press conference that the security on its Kirch loan was legally valid He said the bank's full claim to the stake was confirmed by external legal advisers a few weeks ago Executives said the bank felt comfortable with its security However Frankfurt bankers say the case is complicated because Dresdner Bank extended the credit to Taurus Holding part of the Kirch group in December but secured it against the Telecinco stake which is held by another part of the group Kirch Media It filed for insolvency earlier this week Bankers say the contract securing the loan was drawn up under Spanish law in December but signed under German law in February Under German insolvency law a company administrator has the right to annul some contracts agreed less than three months before the insolvency filing The {XEU}460m Dresdner loan fell due for repayment on Monday but so far the bank has made no move to call in the credit An executive said the bank could be patient We have no need to hurry  Mr Fahrholz said Dresdner which was taken over by German insurer Allianz last year in a {XEU}24bn deal expected loan-loss provisions to fall this year Risk provisions jumped more than 19 per cent to {XEU}1 9bn last year amid a wave of corporate insolvencies Mr Fahrholz said 2002 would be another difficult year as insolvencies in Germany would remain at record levels He also confirmed that a further 200 jobs would be cut at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein the investment banking unit Corporates and markets the group division that combines investment banking and corporate lending suffered a pre-tax loss last year of {XEU}505m against a profit of {XEU}1 22bn a year earlier ,2
2002-04-26, Aetna the largest US health insurer yesterday posted sharply wider first-quarter losses after a charge of almost $3bn However the losses came amid signs that the company's operating outlook was improving as costs fell and customers began paying higher premiums for medical insurance Net losses were $2 83bn or 19 cents a share against losses of $48 2m or 34 cents last year The loss includes a non-cash charge of $2 97bn to write off goodwill related to previous acquisitions Excluding items Aetna said its operating earnings rose to $64 9m or 44 cents compared with $15m or 10 cents last year Shares of Aetna rose by more than 13 per cent to $49 70 by midday trading Jack Rowe who took over as chairman and chief executive two years ago said the quarter reflected the turnround he had hoped for after Aetna's previous management pursued a pricing strategy that favoured gaining market share instead of profitability Aetna is back on track but we're far from done he said We're putting things in place for next year but if our second quarter is less good that doesn't mean the turnround is failing  The company also forecast earnings per share would be $1 35 for the year Analysts were largely pleased with the results This is a different company than it has been historically said Josh Raskin at Lehman Brothers We have tangible signs of improvement with the medical loss ratio considerably lower and medical cost inflation abated  While the results appear promising Aetna is hardly in the clear The company is fending off a proxy battle from a group of dissident shareholders seeking to loosen the company's anti-takeover provisions Herbert Denton chief investment officer at Providence Capital which owns 16000 shares of Aetna stock through funds under management is leading the proxy contest Mr Denton who has made a practice of targeting what he deems as strategically misdirected companies with flagging stock prices has criticised Aetna's board for rejecting a $10bn takeover bid two years ago Mr Denton has nominated a slate of candidates for three board seats The board needs to be much more accountable to shareholders We're out to change the company's corporate governance he said Mr Rowe replied These dissident shareholders are so out of it Here we are beating the Street They're a distraction but nothing more  Aetna which cut 6000 jobs in December did not rule out further lay-offs this year though Mr Rowe said he was loathe to make more cuts We're trying to find ways to reduce expenses substantially without reducing the workforce he said Revenues dropped from $6 43bn to $5 26bn as the company shed unprofitable clients notably in its commercial health plan business Aetna's total health insurance enrolment dropped 18 per cent to 15m members ,2

2002-06-06, Allegations that Perot Systems a Texas computer services specialist helped electricity providers inflate prices in California brought trading in the company to a halt yesterday after the stock slumped 22 per cent to $13 95 in New York The charges stemmed from an undated 47-page document released by state senator Joe Dunn from papers he had received from Reliant Energy one of the companies under investigation for alleged market manipulation Mr Dunn chairs a state committee probing the causes of the power crisis of 2000 and 2001 Perot founded and still chaired by Ross Perot Sr the former presidential candidate designed computer systems for the California Power Exchange which opened in 1998 While the company indicated it was the source of the document it claimed yesterday afternoon that it did not reveal or sell any confidential information of any kind Mr Perot called Mr Dunn earlier in the day and assured him of the company's full co-operation Analysts at Merrill Lynch said the stock slide was unwarranted and that the significance of the document had been misconstrued by Senator Dunn and the Los Angeles Times which first reported its existence The papers reportedly highlighted loopholes in the power exchange opened to serve the newly-deregulated Californian electricity market In one section they noted a small participant could control prices in the state and destabilise trading Another part detailed ways traders could increase prices by causing congestion on the distribution grid a strategy allegedly employed by Enron the bankrupt group at the centre of the US energy sector crisis The LA Times said Reliant had approved the release of the material because it had also been made available to other energy traders Perot suggested the document dated from before the market's opening The defects it had discovered were corrected before the California Power Exchange became operational as the document itself indicates it said ,2
2002-04-16, President George W Bush who marked tax day yesterday with a swing through Iowa and a call for permanent income tax cuts can breathe a sigh of relief Nearly three-quarters of registered voters nationwide believe he is doing a good job of running the country and lowering their tax bills But he can't rest on his laurels for long his approval rating has dipped slightly from a previous poll conducted in January According to a Marist Institute for Public Opinion poll released yesterday 74 per cent of voters polled said they approved of the job Bush is doing as president 17 per cent disapproved and 9 per cent could not make up their minds In a similar poll in January Bush's approval rating was 81 per cent While Bush enjoys support from a majority of registered voters for his handling of international affairs the pollsters said fewer expressed confidence in his conduct of foreign policy or the war against terrorism compared with three months ago As for the seemingly elusive search for peace in the Middle East and the controversial US role in brokering a settlement 49 per cent of voters said they were confident in Bush's ability to handle the situation between Israel and the Palestinians while 43 per cent were uneasy And on the thorny issue of whether the US has a responsibility to help Israel and the Palestinians reach a settlement 59 per cent said yes 33 per cent said no and 8 per cent remained on the fence When it came to Bush's ability to handle the economy 60 per cent of the voters expressed confidence about the same as in the January poll The poll also found that by a margin of nearly two to one Americans still believe the country is headed in the right direction Looking ahead to the 2004 race for the White House 41 per cent of voters said they definitely planned to vote to re-elect Bush In the Democratic camp about one-third of Democrats think Al Gore former vice-president and presidential hopeful should be his party's nominee for president in the next elections ,3

2002-04-18, It was another winning session in UK equities yesterday but only just with the FTSE 100 leading the main indices higher and posting its fourth consecutive gain against an essentially positive economic and companies background on both sides of the Atlantic The session culminated with the chancellor of the exchequer's Budget speech and Alan Greenspan's testimony to Congress's joint economic committee both of which failed to arouse any great passion in either direction in their respective stock markets Gordon Brown's sixth Budget speech brought with it a gradual erosion of the 23 points gain in the FTSE 100 as the chancellor got to his feet in the House of Commons At the close of a session bursting with news the FTSE 100 finished only 4 0 firmer at 5263 9 having driven up to within 8 points of the 5300 level earlier in the afternoon The index briefly dipped into negative territory as Mr Brown's speech came to an end The other indices were much more resolute The FTSE 250 settled 24 1 up at 6183 7 its best of the day while the SmallCap was an impressive 16 7 higher at 2598 9 and the Techmark 100 managed a 3 85 1148 96 But the decline in the market as the chancellor's speech progressed was not seen as stock specific simply a general and gentle downwards drift with traders pointing out that the market was merely taking on board the fact that much of the burden of an increase in national insurance contributions would be borne by companies rather than employees The rest of the chancellors's proposals were more or less as predicted in the speculative stories being run in the press in the lead up to the Budget Commenting on the Budget Tony Jackson UK strategist at ING said It looks as if it lets the consumer off the hook for another year or until the monetary policy committee gets nervous The day's long list of economic data and news was viewed as market-friendly and seen as reducing the likelihood of monetary policy tightening in the short term Average earnings for the quarter to February rose at the slowest pace since records began in 1991 while unemployment fell 6000 and the public sector net cash requirement came in a fraction below the consensus forecast The minutes of the April 3-4 meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee showed the committee voted unanimously to leave interest rates on hold Wall Street followed up Tuesday's sparkling performance which reflected a burst of strong first-quarter results and good news on inflation with a much more cautious approach after Alan Greenspan hinted that the Federal Reserve would not raise US interest rates until the autumn or when US economic recovery is assured and well founded Turnover was a robust 2 7bn shares ,2
2002-06-06, Viva rises on Viacom report Shares in Viva Media rose more than 30 per cent yesterday after a report that Viacom was poised to bid for control of the German music television channel that competes with MTV Viva is part-owned by France's Vivendi Universal AOL Time Warner of the US and the UK's EMI which each own a 15 3 per cent stake It was set up in 1993 to test whether a regional music channel owned by music publishers could take on Viacom's MTV Shares in the company floated in July 2000 rose {XEU}3 60 to a 52-week high of {XEU}14 50 yesterday driven by a report in Germany's Handelsblatt that Viacom was ready to offer about {XEU}22 for each Viva share Dieter Gorny Viva chairman said several parties were interested in the company he founded A bid from Viacom would be recognition of Viva's success in overtaking MTV in terms of viewer numbers in the German market The Cologne-based company has also developed operations in Austria Poland Italy and Hungary Martin Arnold London,2
2002-04-01, The death of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother removes from the House of Windsor a figure of respect and popularity that it cannot easily replace She helped create a successful style that enabled Britain's royal family to adapt to the demands of 20th-century democracy The challenge for her successors is to maintain the public's respect and affection for the monarchy in the very different world of the 21st century The Queen remains in high regard as does Prince Charles despite the controversy that has surrounded him Yet the Queen Mother managed to retain an unrivalled place in the nation's affections until the end especially in her increasingly frail appearances Her determination to attend the funeral of Princess Margaret her younger daughter in February was typical Her faintly wistful smile her courage in wartime her charm and her position as the royal matriarch all contributed But the public responded ultimately to her instinctive sureness of what it meant to be royal This conception was built on keeping out of politics a traditional sense of public duty and morality commitment to her family and an extravagant penchant for palaces Populist instincts After the death of her husband King George VI in 1952 the royal traditions of duty religious observance and political disengagement were continued and strengthened by her daughter Elizabeth II But the present Queen's admired qualities do not include the populist instincts of her mother or her talent for showmanship This has left a chink in the armour of royalty as was shown by misjudgments at the time of the death of Diana Princess of Wales The Queen was slow then to respond to the popular mood She lost public sympathy at first by declining to return promptly to London or to fly the Buckingham Palace flag at half-mast Popular opinion has since rallied and support for the monarchy one of the most stable features of British opinion polls is at the same level in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year as 30 years ago Yet the apparent resumption of business as usual cannot obscure the deeper changes in British society since George VI and Queen Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1936 The consensus of duty religion and social precedence has been slowly falling apart leaving the royal family looking out of touch with an open multicultural society Opposed to remarriage One example is the question of divorce which has distressed the House of Windsor ever since the abdication of Edward VIII The Queen Mother's opposition to the remarriage of divorcees for Princess Margaret as well for her brother-in-law was in simple obedience to the Church's teaching But she was later to see the break-up of three of her grandchildren's marriages including that of Prince Charles heir to the throne Now another constitutional clash looms if Prince Charles should wish to marry Camilla Parker Bowles In an age when the old prohibition of second marriages appears anachronistic the royal family is trapped not only by its constitutional position but also by its own traditions of conformity In many other respects the royal family is struggling to find a new accommodation between its conservatism and the values of a fast-changing society If it cannot adapt the monarchy may slowly lose its symbolic supremacy Princess Diana tried to find a new more direct relationship with the people but failed tragically to blaze a trail that the rest of the family could follow Had the Queen Mother been born towards the end of the 20th century rather than at its beginning her talents and energy might have been well suited to adapting the image of royalty to an altered world As things are that task is left to her heirs They will be helped by the enormous fund of goodwill towards the monarchy that she has bequeathed to the nation It is a legacy fit for a queen ,3
2002-04-12, The Greek transport ministry said yesterday it was replacing Credit Suisse First Boston as adviser for the sale of the majority stake in Olympic Airways The decision to bring in a group of local banks was taken after CSFB had made clear it was unable to find an international buyer for the 51 to 65 per cent stake offered by the government Christos Verelis transport minister told a parliamentary committee that CSFB's fee was too high But people close to the airline said Mr Verelis had decided the restructuring plan put forward by the investment bank was too radical The plan called for Olympic to cut 2000 of 6000 jobs and stop operating loss-making long-haul routes to Australia and the US The airline is close to bankruptcy after reporting estimated losses of $80m last year The ministry is expected to appoint two state-controlled banks National Bank of Greece and Commercial Bank of Greece as advisers They will have a mandate to find a Greek investor group to acquire a majority stake and refinance the airline Under European Union regulations Olympic is not eligible for more state aid The Greek government wants to keep Olympic flying so it can become the flag carrier for the Athens Olympic Games in 2004 But analysts are doubtful whether a Greek investor group would be willing to acquire the airline without insisting on drastic staff cuts In February a Greek group led by the Vardino-yannis shipping family offered $100m for 51 per cent of Olympic but failed to meet a deadline to provide the required bank guarantees Last month the European Commission launched an official inquiry to determine whether Olympic had received state aid illegally ,1
2002-06-29, Cookson moved to dispel concern about its finances yesterday by reminding investors that it renegotiated its banking facilities last year The engineering group said its board continually reviewed its strategic options to maximise shareholder value and to optimise the group's capital structure The comment was a response to rumours that Cookson had pulled plans for a rights issue because of market volatility Cookson's troubles have surfaced during a period of heightened interest in corporate transparency and accounting practices after revelations of wrongdoing at Enron and WorldCom Its shares have fallen 65 per cent over the past year as trading conditions in the group's core electronics business failed to recover In the year to last December the division which supplies materials to the semiconductor industry recorded an operating loss of £14 3m £134 6m profit It had net debts of about £800m at the end of last year against shareholders' funds of £551m Much of Cookson's debt resulted from a string of cash-funded acquisitions in 2000 when demand for semiconductors and electronic devices was strong But the downturn hit just as Cookson had increased its gearing The group arranged a £450m multi-currency revolving facility last December to replace an existing £500m credit line about half of which was due to mature this year HSBC one of Cookson's main lenders and one of the banks involved in the credit facility said it was aware of the situation and that Cookson had not breached any banking covenants Analysts said they believed the new facility cushioned Cookson from immediate financial crisis but that the group still needed to raise cash The most likely options are to sell assets or proceed with the rights issue regardless of market conditions Cookson's precious metals division which generates most cash for the company is rumoured to be a candidate for sale Mike Bloggs analyst at ING Barings said that without raising cash Cookson was dependent on a recovery in the markets The problem is that it's a very cyclical business It will always be a cyclical business Shareholders have to take that on board  Cookson will make a quarterly trading statement on July 5 when it is likely to give more details about its financial situation Its shares closed down 3{1/2}p at 48{1/2}p ,2
2002-06-21, Canada yesterday unveiled a C$8 2bn package of support for its farmers and urged the US to reduce financial assistance for the sector The federal government will spend C$5 2bn on agricultural assistance over the next six years with the rest of the cash expected to come from the provinces The government has been under intense pressure from farmers to assist them in the face of low commodity prices and rising agricultural subsides in the US The US Farm Bill envisages agricultural support of almost $190bn over the next decade The move also comes at a time of rising trade tensions with the US not least over US curbs on imports of Canadian softwood lumber Our government will continue to make a forceful case against runaway agricultural subsidies especially the wrong-headed US Farm Bill said Jean Chretien the prime minister That continues to distort international markets  The US farm legislation risks damaging the cause of global development added Mr Chretien who will host the Group of Eight summit of rich nations and Russia next week We cannot ask Africans to improve their economy and help them produce more products and give them no markets  Canada's western premiers attacked the Liberal government for not shouldering more of the funding burden Some of the money in the latest package will replace existing supports and is not fresh cash The package includes C$3 4bn in federal funding to implement Canada's new agricultural policy framework which is aimed at making the industry more responsive to consumer demands and more globally competitive The government is also providing C$1 2bn over the next two years to help farmers deal with problems such as drought The government assistance was given a cautious welcome by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture which said it would review its implementation ,3

2002-06-07, The booming business of state securitisations in southern Europe is on hold ahead of the July release of European Union guidelines on how member states should treat a number of complex financial operations including securitisation in their debt ratio calculations Over the past few years countries such as Italy and Greece have been criticised for resorting to securitisation as a means of shedding debt from their national income accounts making their public finances look healthier than they may actually be The debt-to-GDP ratio is one of the key benchmarks for budgetary discipline in the EU's stability and growth pact We realised that more and more member states were resorting to these operations said an EU Commission official No definitive rules have ever been set for these instruments so each country would account for them as they wished he said In July an EU taskforce composed of outside experts as well as central bank representatives will set the rules relating to the national income accounting treatment of the sale of non-financial assets future flows and loans Member states will have to reclassify past and future operations because the new guidelines will also have retroactive effect the Commission official said Should securitisations be reclassified on member states' accounts as debt the supply side of one of the most thriving sectors in the European fixed-income markets in Europe could be damaged We cannot exclude that this may signal the end of state securitisations in their current form one analyst said Reactions to the Eurostat taskforce among member states have varied significantly In April Greece said it was freezing all its securitisation plans until after Eurostat's conclusions were released Since 1999 Greece has issued securitisations worth more than {XEU}5bn $4 7bn and its issues are equivalent to 4 1 per cent of GDP higher than in any other eurozone state In contrast in Italy the largest market for state securitisations in the eurozone having issued paper worth {XEU}9 4bn last year the treasury ministry is moving ahead with its securitisation programme unaffected by the prospect of new Eurostat rules Italy is due to launch the third tranche of state pension contribution-backed bonds worth {XEU}3bn later this month Analysts said the main explanation for the lack of concern on the Italian side is that in Italian securitisations the state rarely guarantees the bonds When there are no direct governmental guarantees on the performance of the notes the credit risk is passed on solely to investors with the state not being forced to cover potential losses to noteholders said Alex Cataldo a securitisation analyst at Moody's in Milan That is the one of the main differences between some of the past Italian and Greek securitisations he said ,2
2002-04-18, Gordon Brown has cast aside some of his traditional pessimism about the potential of the British economy to give himself room for manoeuvre in otherwise tight public finances The Treasury has revised upwards its assessment of how fast the economy can grow without pushing up inflation It now believes trend growth is 2 75 per cent The chancellor based his last five budgets on cautious assumptions about Britain's trend rate of growth In the past the Treasury put annual trend growth at 2 5 per cent External estimates put trend growth in a range of 2 5-2 8 per cent with the International Monetary Fund the most optimistic In order to maintain a cautious assumption for public finance projections the Treasury lops off {1/4} of a percentage point when forecasting future tax revenues The chancellor will therefore base future public finances projections on a forecast of 2 5 per cent annual growth In 2003-04 he is even more optimistic basing the forecasts on a growth assumption of 2{3/4} per cent Mr Brown said the National Audit Office had assessed the change and considered it reasonable and cautious The revision gives him a good deal of extra money to play with in the form of higher tax revenues According to the Treasury Red Book the change cuts public sector net borrowing by £1bn in 2002-03 rising to £5bn in 2006-07 The Treasury does not base its revision on assumptions of faster productivity growth which has been falling but on growth in the workforce The working age population is now increasing twice as fast as in the 10 years prior to 1997 due to a surge in people entering the labour force fewer retirees and higher immigration Economists do not believe the revision is too optimistic David Hillier economist at Barclays Capital believes the official statistics may not accurately report Britain's productivity growth because growth is undervalued particularly in the service sector But he is not reassured by the timing of the change It is surprising and worrying that this has come at the time the government needs extra cash for extra spending he said Some economists worry that Mr Brown has thrown away some of his caution It is not prudent In the past he has been pretty cautious hoping for an upturn surprise says John Butler economist at HSBC Even when the economy had outperformed expectations Mr Brown would return to his original growth assumptions This time he has locked in trends in past economic growth which he had previously considered temporary It is not a way of treating the public finances says Mr Butler Mr Brown has put improving productivity performance at the heart of his economic policy The government hopes tougher competition rules the encouragement of entrepreneurs and incentives for investment particularly in research and development will help Britain close the productivity gap with the United States France and Germany ,2
2002-06-03, Success in retail banking lies in the details says Fernando Ulrich vice-president of Banco BPI As the global downturn and a domestic fiscal crisis restrict economic growth Portuguese banks are focusing with redoubled attention on the subtleties of competition customer service and cost cutting Financial products are becoming increasingly standardised and more easily copied says Antonio Horta Osorio chairman of the Totta group To keep ahead of the competition banks need to have lower cost structures innovative products and high quality service  Slower economic growth and a restrictive government budget are damping the big expansion in business that Portuguese banks have enjoyed over the past three years Lending growth will be much slower particularly in the corporate sector and it's reasonable to expect a slight deterioration in credit quality says Mr Ulrich Deceleration was already considered inevitable to check unsustainable credit growth Lending could not go on increasing at rates of 16 or 17 per cent a year says Antonio de Sousa chairman of the state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos Portugal's biggest bank That kind of growth always leads to the bursting of a credit bubble We can now expect two or three years of slower but more solid credit growth  The downturn has also brought the first signs of a decline in asset quality In January Standard & Poor's the international rating agency said that although bad loans remained at a comfortable level the degree of concentration of bank lending to Portugal's leading companies was particularly delicate at a time when a sharp slowdown in economic growth is likely to impact on these companies In response to the increased risk the four biggest listed banks increased their provisions against non-performing loans by a total of 85 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 Competition had led to aggressive lending to big companies at very low spreads says Mr Ulrich In this climate cost cutting has become central to the strategies of Portugal's biggest banks We are focusing all our attention on costs says Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado chairman of Banco Espirito Santo Cost control is absolutely critical agrees Mr Ulrich BPI which has grown rapidly from an investment bank to a universal financial group through a series of large-scale acquisitions faces one of the most difficult cost cutting challenges From a cost-to-income ratio of 72 per cent in 2000 the highest in Portugal the group has set a target of reducing staff administrative and amortisation costs to 62 per cent of earnings excluding financial trading by December 2003 having achieved 68 per cent last year Other banks are engaged in similar programmes The Totta group owned by Spain's Santander Central Hispano has achieved the lowest cost structure among Portugal's big banks From a cost-to-income ratio of 54 per cent when Santander acquired the group in April 2000 Totta expects to achieve a ratio of 45 per cent by the end of 2002 a year ahead of its initial target The focus on costs is part of a wider drive to extract value from the wave of mergers acquisitions and cross-border investment that transformed the Portuguese banking sector two years ago The trend towards consolidation has been stronger than in any other European Union country with the number of banks falling by almost 28 per cent Mergers and acquisitions have seen the combined market share of the three biggest banks climb to 65 per cent the highest in Europe after Finland and Sweden and level with the Netherlands The top five banks account for about 85 per cent of the market not only in banking but also in insurance assets management brokerage and other financial services which are largely owned by the big banks The jury is still out on whether consolidation is delivering the gains shareholders had hoped for Mr Salgado says the results are below expectations vindicating BES's option to grow organically rather than through mergers and acquisitions although the group reached an advanced stage of merger plans with Banco BPI in 2000 before the deal collapsed I believe that concentration has not brought the results the market was expecting Mr Salgado says Since 1992 when shareholders led by the Espirito Santo family reacquired the bank which had been nationalised in 1975 BES's average market share has almost doubled from 9 to 17 per cent through organic growth alone he says Whether by acquisition or organically the growth of the big banks has placed heavy demands for capital on shareholders BES for example has raised its capital every two years on average Shareholders have been supportive says Mr Salgado partly because the bank has delivered a return on equity of more than 20 per cent a year until last year's market downturn saw the rate fall to 15 6 per cent Banco Comercial Portugues which has built itself into Portugal's biggest listed bank through a series of bold acquisitions is committed to making no capital calls in 2002 This will avoid any further dilution of earnings per share which fell 23 per cent in 2001 partly as a result of capital increases in 2000 and 2001 We are confident we can generate enough funds ourselves to back the scale of expansion we have in mind for this year says Jorge Jardim Goncalves BCP chairman The biggest strain on BCP's resources has come from overseas expansion Poland and Greece have been the focus for investments totalling {XEU}9bn over the past two years with the acquisition of dominant stakes in BIG Bank Gdanski Poland's fifth largest bank and NovaBank a successful new retail bank created by BCP in Greece The group has also transferred its insurance assets to Eureko the Netherlands-based pan-European insurer in which it owns almost 25 per cent Doubts over the potential profitability of these overseas projects and the impact on Eureko of the global downturn in the insurance sector have contributed to a drop in BCP's share price this year But Mr Jardim Goncalves believes some analysts are in too much of a hurry to see results from the group's international investments Our business in Poland and Greece is growing at a faster pace than similar BCP operations in Portugal grew he says Ventures like NovaRede BCP's main retail network and Banco 7 its telephone and internet banking channel took four to five years to develop We are confident that in the medium term our overseas operations will account for more than 30 per cent of total earnings ,2
2002-04-23, France's main parties of the left yesterday united to block right-wing extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen the leader of the National Front by pledging to vote for President Jacques Chirac in the second round of the presidential elections on May 5 The sudden unity of the mainstream parties of the left and right followed the shock outcome of Sunday's first-round presidential vote which saw Mr Le Pen gain second place ahead of Lionel Jospin the Socialist premier The anti-Le Pen common front reflected deep unease over this 73-year-old former paratrooper's 16 86 per cent of the vote and a sense of shame that France should be seen abroad with its most important office closely contested by a man branded a racist The move came as it emerged yesterday that Mr Le Pen had been supported by a broad coalition of workers the unemployed and the retired The left by making common cause with the moderate right against Mr Le Pen made the re-election of Mr Chirac for a new five-year mandate look even more certain yesterday In the first round definitive result Mr Chirac polled 19 88 per cent the lowest score of an incumbent head of state under the Fifth Republic Francois Hollande Socialist secretary-general called on his party to form a dam against the candidate of the extreme right He went on to label Mr Le Pen as a danger to the republic as the party digested Mr Jospin's poor showing of 16 18 per cent A similar call to cross the traditional left-right divide in French politics came from the Greens and from the Communist party whose vote collapsed to 3 4 per cent However grass roots response to these calls was muted Several Socialist mayors in south-west France warned they would not cast their votes for Mr Chirac Mr Le Pen was yesterday relishing his surprise presence in the second round which led to clashes between his supporters and left-wing demonstrators in several French cities on Sunday night Further demonstrations in some 20 cities were staged yesterday mainly by students against Mr Le Pen under-lining the threat to public order presented by such a polarised line-up in the final presidential vote One of Mr Chirac's concerns yesterday was whether to accept a television debate with Mr Le Pen But Mr Chirac's team was mainly concentrated on trying to forge a unified movement among the mainstream right-wing parties to contest the June parliamentary elections This was seen as an essential step to head off the possibility of the left recouping power by retaining control of the legislature Mr Le Pen in his Sunday victory statement raised the spectre of using his new-found strength to split the vote in the parliamentary elections three ways which would benefit the left The Socialist party also began to focus on the June general election confirming Mr Hollande would remain secretary-general so as to co-ordinate the campaign Reports and analysis Pages 8-10 Editorial Comment Page 18 Nothing left Page 18 Observer Page 19 www ft com/france2002,3
2002-06-17, Panalpina one of the world's largest freight forwarding companies has become the latest casualty of the weakness in world stock markets after it dropped plans for its long-awaited initial public offering on the Swiss stock exchange Panalpina founded more than a century ago as a Rhine shipping company announced on Friday that the Ernst Gohner Foundation which owns the company had postponed the planned IPO of more than 50 per cent of the company The Foundation said that it considered the stock market situation was currently unfavourable for a successful share flotation The postponement of Panalpina's IPO is a blow to the Swiss stock market There has been a dearth of new issues over the past 18 months and the market had been hoping for an end to the drought Converium the former reinsurance arm of Zurich Financial Services which was spun off late last year on the US and Swiss stock markets has been the only sizeable transaction and there is increasing speculation that Roche the Swiss pharma giant will sell its vitamins and fine chemicals operation via a trade sale or private-equity transaction rather than risk floating it on the Swiss stock market Panalpina's decision to delay its IPO will increase the pressure on Royalty Pharma a fast-growing US-led company which specialises in buying royalty interests in drugs allowing it to share part of the risk and reward of new drug launches The company's shares are due to be priced on June 20 Pharma Royalty had already pulled its planned IPO once before when it tried to float its shares on Germany's Neuer Markt in late 2000 ,2

1998-04-01, Druid a management consultancy specialising in large business systems saw strong improvements in both revenues and pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 The company has benefited from customers' preparations for Emu and measures to tackle the millennium bomb but David Tebbs chairman said yesterday that these factors played a relatively small role in its growth The bulk of our work remains the implementation of business change for strategic reasons This is reflected in the longer-term revenue streams we are seeing from our major clients  Pre-tax profits rose 34 per cent to £2 4m on turnover up 52 per cent at £14 3m John Pocock appointed managing director during the half-year emphasised that turnover and profits figures referred entirely to consultancy activities The cost of software and hardware systems implemented for customers did not go through the books Staff numbers rose 42 per cent to 329 and the company is recruiting Druid installs large-scale accounting and business software systems for customers including British Aerospace Cadbury OKI and Philip Morris Earnings rose 53 per cent to 6 92p and the interim dividend is 1 25p 0 8p The shares rose 16p to 841p ,2
2002-04-02, 'All I learned about management I learned out of programme teams which always seemed to me to be really great models if they worked You'd have a great editor four or five producers a pile of researchers other people working in other jobs never more than 30 or 40 You could bring them all together you could all celebrate success you could all mourn failure you could all laugh together you could all joke together you could know each other If you could replicate that at all sorts of levels you're away Just before I took this job I went back to the Harvard Business School for a couple of days just to do a course that I wanted to go on What they basically said was the only organisations that are going to succeed in the first part of the 21st century are those where the rules get broken Where people take all sorts of risks The sorts of examples they used the Sony PlayStation The Sony PlayStation was developed inside Sony without anyone ever telling the board of Sony And why Because the board of Sony as you know would have said we don't do games Stop It's about how do you free up people so they can steal bits of budgets here and there so they can develop other things they can do other things But there's no way that the central leadership is going to decide and make it happen Dyke on commercial funding of BBC services I came in from the commercial world believing that we could get more money out of the commercial marketplace for some of the things we do I'm not so sure that's true now When I was in the commercial marketplace I never discussed competition policy and the Office of Fair Trading once in my life I only discuss it at the BBC it's all I do Therefore there's a limit to what you can do now in the commercial world to bring in additional revenue to the BBC We spend L2 5bn a year and probably L100m comes from commercial sources That proportion can get bigger but it won't get significantly bigger ,3
2002-06-10, Jean-Marie Messier has an annoying habit of changing his mind But at least with the sale of Telepi`u to News Corporation the Vivendi Universal chairman is changing it the right way dumping rather than acquiring a loss-making business The financial impact on Vivendi is complicated by a {XEU}500m deferred payment which is guaranteed by News Corp but is also largely the reimbursement of football rights already paid by Vivendi Assuming eventual repayment Rupert Murdoch does not appear to be making a killing from his arch rival's financial woes It is a wonder he did not wait longer for Telepi`u to go bust The Italian pay-TV unit contributed {XEU}350m to the {XEU}500m of losses in Canal Plus's operating free cash flow last year that could not have continued long given the importance for Vivendi of its cash generation The losses will be staunched which is positive Also every {XEU}1bn of debt reduction counts in the media and communications group on which Vivendi's credit ratings depend The problem is Mr Messier's track record on acquisitions and disposals suggests debt levels may continue to behave as unpredictably as his mind For he faces a lingering temptation to secure the cashflows from the telecommunications business Cegetel which Vivendi fully consolidates without economic control That would mean buying out the minorities BT and SBC which Vivendi cannot afford to do ,1
2002-06-19, The European Commission is set today to approve a controversial {XEU}1 4bn $1 3bn recapitalisation programme for Alitalia the lossmaking carrier controlled by the Italian state even though Brussels' formal ban on state aid for failing airlines saw Sabena go bankrupt last year Loyola de Palacio Europe's transport commissioner has decided not to open a formal investigation into the operation which will be 62 per cent financed by the Italian state because of the presence of private investors and commitments by Alitalia to reduce its activities Her opinion is set to be endorsed by a meeting of the 20-strong Commission today The decision is likely to be particularly controversial since in March the Commission announced an investigation into a {XEU}19 5m loan from a state-owned bank to keep Greece's Olympic Airlines flying and has had a recent exchange of letters with the Belgian government over a {XEU}125m loan from a state-controlled entity for SN Brussels Airlines the successor to Sabena We are following the three companies' financial consolidation very closely Ms de Palacio said in a recent interview with the Financial Times Any decision we take or don't take is submitted to legal control through the European Court of Justice  Some member state officials complain that the Commission has been too hard on airlines from smaller European Union countries Last year Brussels rejected requests from Bertie Ahern the Irish prime minister to allow his government to underwrite loans to Aer Lingus Ms de Palacio has made no secret that she wants to see fewer EU national carriers so Europe's fragmented aviation sector can compete better with the US However the Commission points out that Aer Lingus has survived without government assistance Nor is the Commission proceeding aggressively against SN Brussels Airlines which is less than half the size of the old Sabena Officials argue that the Italian scheme differs from Olympic's cash injection in that the private sector is committed to providing at least 38 per cent of the new funds and that not a euro of public money will be provided if the private-sector cash is not forthcoming Alitalia needs the cash after reporting a {XEU}907m loss for last year but Brussels officials were impressed that two of the three main financial institutions underwriting the operation Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse arenon-Italian The third is IMI Sanpaolo They were also reassured by written commitments by the Italian government that Alitalia would continue its policy of divesting non-core assets with an accompanying reduction in the company's 22000 headcount It is in the final stages of selling Sigma a booking system distributor and plans to sell Eurofly its charter company and Italiatour its tour operator before the end of the year The Commission also recognises that its margin of maneouvre over Alitalia was limited after it lost a European court case against the airline in 2000 over a previous package of state aid ,1
2002-06-06, AOL Time Warner yesterday defended its forecasts for online advertising revenues in the face of Wall Street doubts about its business this year Wayne Pace chief financial officer told investors gathered at the Deutsche Bank media conference that he still expected AOL to generate at least $1 8bn in online advertising revenue While this figure represents a sharp decline in online advertising at AOL at one point last year analysts projected the group could generate $4 6bn in sales in 2002 Mr Pace's confidence contrasts with emerging Wall Street doubts Lehman Brothers the investment bank this week projected that AOL's online advertising revenue would total $1 79bn down 34 per cent from 2001 AOL shares fell nearly 5 per cent on the comments We believe that the timing of a turnround will likely come later than projected by management said Holly Becker analyst at Lehman For Mr Pace setting what he called a floor of AOL's advertising revenue was possibly a bold move The company has been punished by investors for setting ambitious financial targets that it could not reach Mr Pace's predecessor Mike Kelly was given another job at the company last year amid growing mistrust among investors Mr Pace said there were encouraging signs in the advertising market overall noting that upfront sales for the autumn television season are higher than expected But he cautioned that online advertising will probably be the last category to rebound The thought is there will be an advertising market rebound but online will rebound later he said In a down advertising market it is the most difficult proposition to prove to potential advertisers Mr Pace said he expects AOL's advertising revenue to rise next year He said Robert Pittman chief operating officer who has also been put in charge of the AOL division is successfully targeting more traditional types of advertisers The AOL service once touted as the growth engine of the company has been under intense scrutiny from investors this year Online advertising has been the chief short-term concern but there is a worry that the company is not moving quickly enough to develop high-speed internet relationships with cable providers Mr Pace said the company was in discussions with most large cable companies in the US about offering AOL to their high-speed internet customers The talks are complicated he said by issues of how revenue is to be split and who is responsible for customer service The stock rose 28 cents or 1 6 per cent to $17 48 in early New York trade They have fallen 67 per cent over the past year ,2
2002-04-05, Biocompatibles International the medical devices company is poised to distribute to shareholders all of the £140m cash generated from the proposed buy-out of its core assets by Abbott Laboratories of the US Management is set today to announce a special dividend worth about 100p in total up from the 90p previously mooted The distribution is understood to be payable in two tranches one of 70p-80p now and 20p-30p when an escrow account created as part of the Abbott transaction is opened up later in the year Even disaffected shareholders praised management for being receptive to investor opinion One top 30 investor said All credit to them If they've listened to us and gone from zero to 100p then they've done more than a lot of companies have  Abbott's offer made last month is worth a net £139m cash plus a royalty stream which Crispin Simon chief executive has said could be worth as much again over six to seven years Biocompatibles has a further £75m in the bank principally the cash generated from the sale of its eyecare division in January When the Abbott deal was announced last month the company suggested it would make no decision about whether the cash from the sale would be returned to shareholders or invested in rebuilding the company But pressure from shareholders has persuaded management to factor a special dividend into today's documentation A 100p pay-out will appease many institutions Andrew Musson global life sciences director at 3i Biocompatibles' second-biggest shareholder with a 4 per cent-plus stake said It's pretty much a no-brainer to accept this offer now that we are where we are To reject it would be to shoot oneself in the foot  But Biocompatibles cannot afford to be complacent Although Mr Simon is estimated to have secured support from institutions representing up to half of the shares he needs 75 per cent backing for the Abbott deal to go ahead Analysts believe that could be tricky to secure if smaller institutions and private investors many of whom bought in at more than £13 in 1997 and are now angry that the investment they bought into is being gutted convert their anger into a no vote Meetings to approve the Abbott deal and the dividend proposal are due in the coming weeks The shares fell 2{1/2}p to 98p ,2
2002-06-26, Ian Schrager would sell his bou tique hotel company tomorrow But he is not expecting any offers in the five years or so he reckons it will take for the industry to recover In the interim he is reworking his image not for the first time and forging ahead with an ambitious expansion programme It is not an easy prospect for the Brooklyn-born impresario who turns 56 in a couple of weeks Mr Schrager has ridden just about every trend in the volatile hospitality business since his days at Studio 54 the legendary New York nightclub now celebrating its 25th anniversary which he helped found Industry insiders who know him well say this time he is running scared desperate to adjust to the business climate after September 11 and to stem the losses caused by what some industry analysts consider were the hotel industry's biggest ever room rate cuts Mr Schrager puts on a brave face saying that he is as hungry as ever for success He regrets the cuts saying he should have treated the plunge in hotel occupancy as a wound letting it heal on its own But at the time he felt he had no other choice If just one or two others had held out I would have too But no one did  Analysts estimate that the average rate at his nine hotels fell to just over $200 £140 a night from $460 The real cost may be even greater Cheaper rates open the doors at the Paramount and Royalton in New York the Delano in Miami and at his six other hotels to a different clientele a dangerous development for a brand that defines itself above all as hip Hotel occupancy rates in the US and in Britain where Schrager owns and operates St Martin's Lane and the Sanderson hotels have almost recovered to pre-September levels according to the tracking company Smith Travel Research But room rates continue to be down by about 10 per cent in most big cities and at least that at Mr Schrager's properties Some people say they never will recover Mr Schrager says But that's ridiculous I've heard the same said about the price of oil of gold and just about everything else  He thinks industry rates will fully recover by 2006 unless there is another big terrorist attack A bigger question is whether boutique hotels in general and Mr Schrager's innovative modernistic establishments in particular will again be able to demand a price premium over traditional and often more comfortable hotels Mr Schrager is confident that time is on his side Revenue per available room is recovering at boutiques albeit more slowly than at other hotels after a 16 per cent plunge last year But it is still a far cry from 1999 when revenue per available room for boutiques grew three times more than the industry as a whole Bjorn Hanson the lodgings and hospitality expert at PwC in New York predicts that boutiques will continue to find it hard to regain the cachet they had at their peak when Mr Schrager's hotels were inspiring imitators around the world It's going to be difficult maybe impossible says Mr Hanson But if anyone can do it Ian can He has the gift  Mr Schrager says his gift if he has one is that he understands human nature He recalls Steve Rubell his late partner worrying in the planning stages of Studio 54 about whether people still wanted to dance I told him that people have been dancing since Sodom and Gomorrah and that's not going to change Mr Schrager recalls People will always respond to things that are on the edge resourceful and subversive to the status quo  Keeping that image fresh in the hotel industry is a challenge especially if like Mr Schrager you do not plan to spend much on re- modelling Apart from the minuscule size of the rooms in some of his buildings which he says he would change if he could afford to he does not think remodelling is necessary He says that contrary to some press reports he is continuing his relationship with Philippe Starck the French designer behind the look in many of his hotels although Mr Schrager is now also working with the Canadian Bruce Mau I don't think we need any really big adjustments more of a nip and tuck and paint Mr Schrager says Anything that is provocative and fresh will stand the test of time Look at Antonio Gaudi's work in Barcelona Attitude doesn't change  What does change he says is the mood The Generation X crowd that packed the bars and restaurants of his hotels in the late 1990s is a little older and a lot wiser he says They still see their choice of hotel as an expression of their style much as they do their choice of clothing or car although Mr Schrager appears to have dropped his off-putting slogan of a few years back You are where you sleep  And they are still inter-ested in hotels as meeting places But he believes they do want better service Arrogant receptionists and bellhops are no longer acceptable especially with business travellers These represent just 25 per cent or so of his guests or about half the proportion at more traditional hotels Until now Mr Schrager has targeted the advertising entertainment and high-technology industries but he is now keen to attract customers from the broader business market Service is key he says We are going to have great service that is modern more casual not fawning  He is implementing a company-wide 11-day training programme that will be administered by the company's new human resources department Can you believe that we never had a human resources department before he exclaims We made money in spite of ourselves  Other changes include a new website that is scheduled for launch on July 16 and possibly an advertising campaign Mr Schrager is also considering revamping his brand including the use of his name and image but says he has not yet worked out how best to exploit these assets The important thing he says is not to make changes that will undermine what he has already achieved and to soldier on To that effect he has decided to continue with his expansion plan which has been on hold for months The Miramar in Santa Barbara and the Empire and Astor Place in New York are scheduled to open within the next two years Also planned are developments in continental Europe and Latin America and at least one other in Miami Indeed Mr Schrager says he may make an announcement about another property in the next few weeks although his staff suggest they hear that quite often Chase Burritt lodgings expert with Ernst & Young in Miami calculates Mr Schrager may just pull it all off His best defence is playing a good offence and that's what he is doing Besides he doesn't have a choice There isn't a buyer in sight ,2
2002-06-17, By most objective measures Poland has never had it this good Thirteen years of painstaking economic diplomatic and legal efforts have brought the country to the verge of European Union membership the triumphant final chapter of its post-cold war reunion with the west Poles with their fondness for historical analogies compare the coming event to such watersheds as accepting Christianity in 966 and regaining independence from foreign rule in 1918 Yet the prevailing mood among most Poles is one of exhaustion apathy and frustration The past year has seen a marked coarsening of political discourse with the election to parliament for the first time of radical Eurosceptic parties led by Andrzej Lepper's Self-Defence September 11 and Russia's subsequent rapprochement with the US have diminished Poland's geopolitical standing by weakening its claim to be an indispensible eastern ally of America and the EU Falling economic growth has exposed gaping holes in Polish public finance industrial competitiveness and corporate governance Unemployment has soared to 18 per cent and the economy once a standard-bearer for central and eastern Europe is set to grow just 1 per cent for the second year running Zyta Gilowska an MP with the centre-right Civic Platform says We have turned from Europe's tiger into its hippopotamus  Without doubt Prime Minister Leszek Miller's leftist/ agrarian coalition has made progress in righting the failing economy and the vexed EU accession effort it inherited from its predecessor Jerzy Buzek's rightists left office last October with the draft central budget in ruins and negotiations with Brussels at a near-standstill Anger at their perceived fecklessness and corruption prompted Poles to vote both Mr Buzek's Solidarity and the centrist Freedom Union its former coalition partner out of parliament Brussels has since praised the Miller government for a pragmatic approach that pushed negotiations sharply forward By early June Poland had provisionally closed 25 out of the 29 chapters it needs to negotiate with Brussels placing it in the middle of the candidates for accession in 2004 The coalition has also begun digging Poland out of its economic hole It has passed sent to parliament or begun work on dozens of new laws aimed at reducing spending rolling back intrusive tax bureaucracy and easing conditions for business A more-flexible labour code is wending its way toward passage if approved it will reward years of lobbying by business groups If we are to compete in the world it is through our entrepreneurs says Henryka Bochniarz head of the Polish Confederation of Private Employers They have learnt how to survive in difficult times  The government's four-year infrastructure programme promises $35bn in new road and housing construction which if even partially realised will help to stimulate employment and GDP growth Marek Belka's finance ministry is quietly rolling back public entitlements in many areas of essence if Poland is to bring its chronic deficits under control Mr Miller compares his job to that of the Titanic's captain and asserts his cabinet's efforts have rescued Poland from economic collapse I am convinced that our activities saved public finance from   an Argentine abyss he says But some economists and opposition politicians say Mr Miller's efforts to reform public finance do not go nearly far enough The coalition has also faced criticism in Poland and abroad after a series of controversial policy decisions It has recentralised healthcare funding and sidelined an overhaul of the education system reversing two well-intentioned but poorly implemented social reforms begun under Mr Buzek It has postponed privatisation in some industries and reopened a corporate-governance dispute with Netherlands-based Eureko over insurer Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen raising questions about Poland's quality as a place to invest It has begun work on a draft media law which companies and journalists claim will hamper press freedom a charge the government angrily rejects And it has led a sharply worded public relations assault on the National Bank of Poland gleefully echoed by extremist MPs claiming its conservatism on cutting interest rates is perpetuating economic stagnation Economists differ on the merits of the criticism but many have expressed alarm at the attacks' often ugly tone and their implications for the bank's integrity The government's first eight months in office have seen a decline in its popularity ratings down to 31 per cent in one recent poll People hoped the new government would at least put some order in the house and decrease social stress says Aleksander Smolar chairman of the Stefan Batory Foundation a leading non-governmental group But the capital was spoiled by this coalition  Mr Miller avers that his government's record will be vindicated by 2004 when it forecasts Poland's return to 5 per cent GDP growth as a new EU member Success on both counts is essential if his SLD hopes to win re-election in 2005 The mark of a true man the prime minister has said is not in how he starts but in how he finishes  Yet completing the job of entering the EU will further test the Poles' already-rattled nerves Negotiations on farm and regional aid and the EU budget set for completion in a late-year negotiating marathon will be technically challenging and politically sensitive With a year-end deadline to finish negotiations hanging over candidates the political tensions could not be higher A referendum on membership is planned for late next year More than 70 per cent of Poles who plan to vote currently favour it That number could fall depending on how successfully the anti-EU lobby exploits Polish farmers' concerns about the impact of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy Mr Miller said his government would resign if it lost and in May launched an 18-month public relations campaign aimed at informing Poles of the benefits of joining I have great hope that the result will be positive but we will have to work hard for it he says As important as whether Poland enters the EU a near-certainty by most accounts is its future performance as a member Successful preparations now will mean it profits fully from the increased aid and commercial flows of the single market Gaps in this readiness will cause trauma and disappointment for both Poles and their EU partners Current trends however point toward the latter outcome Poland's squeeze on state spending has intensified EU misgivings over its administration's ability to handle the new regimens membership will bring An EU system for registering livestock for example is still several hundred administrators short of the 1600 needed to run it says Bruno Dethomas the European Commission's top diplomat in Warsaw Poland must demonstrate to the EU it has the money and the will to open new consulates in Ukraine Belarus and Russia to process millions of new visas beginning July 2003 And it needs to prepare bureaucrats in its regions through which most aid will flow to handle the hefty paperwork that membership will bring We do not want to lose a single euro for having been poorly prepared says Danuta Hubner Poland's minister for European affairs An economic recovery could boost both enthusiasm for EU accession and the government's poll ratings Slowing demand and the strong zloty have been bruising for companies but in many cases made them fitter Polish companies have boosted their produc- tivity by between 15 and 20 per cent since the current downturn began says Witold Orlowski chief economic adviser to President Aleksander Kwasniewski The economy has adapted but at a price he says Business-confidence indicators are beginning to point upward with some companies reporting a recent increase in sales Essential to the strength of any turnaround will be recovery in Germany which takes more than one-third of Polish exports Another key factor War saw cannot control is enthusiasm for enlargement on the EU's side Gunter Verheugen EU enlargement commissioner warned recently that the window for expansion was closing amid a rise in extreme-right rhetoric Enlargement barely figures as a popular issue in most member states but could enter voters' sights as a negative when the financial issues reach the negotiating table at year-end Any souring of sentiment in the EU would provide ammunition to Poland's own extremists Recent polls show Mr Lepper's Self-Defence which has grabbed media attention by staging illegal protests and seeking to block parliamentary debate emerging as Poland's second most popular political party The group along with the extreme-nationalist League of Polish Families has won support on difficult-to-rebut claims that Poland's decade-old accession preparations have brought it nothing but pain The parties have succeeded in setting much of the agenda in Poland's debate over Europe and putting the government on the defensive With only a touch of melodrama officials warn of a political victory for extremists and Belarus-type political isolation on the fringes of Europe should Poland

2002-04-24, Commerzbank Germany's third-largest listed bank is planning a shake-up of its investment banking operations in an effort to boost profitability and lift the group's share price Commerzbank's proposals which will be presented to the board in the near future will involve a further integration of the bank's capital market and commercial lending businesses Its revamp comes as Klaus-Peter Muller who took over as Commerzbank chairman a year ago struggles to reverse the sharp decline in the bank's fortunes by shedding unprofitable businesses and cutting costs Commerzbank executives say a reshaping of investment and corporate banking offers one of the best chances of improving the bank's return on equity which fell to less than 1 per cent last year It should also help the share price which has been stuck in a {XEU}19-{XEU}20 trading range for several months in spite of takeover rumours Executives say the aim of the revamp will be to focus the investment bank on distributing higher margin derivative and structured products to Commerzbank's corporate and retail clients Mehmet Dalman head of investment banking wants to exploit the bank's expertise in derivatives securities and corporate lending in order to become a leading player in the long overdue restructuring of corporate Germany He believes corporate risk and restructuring will be the core focus for bankers over the next few years as they rethink their relationships with corporate clients in the wake of the tidal wave of insolvencies sweeping through Germany He wants to position the investment bank as a risk platform and a risk intermediary between corporate clients on the one side and institutional investors hedge funds and retail investors on the other By doing so he is convinced Commerzbank can build a profitable investment banking business that would offer corporate and institutional clients a full spectrum of products and services We need to offer more than just cheap money to our clients We need to add value for clients said one executive Mr Dalman believes a specialist investment bank with a regional focus on Europe but the capacity to service clients elsewhere could achieve revenues of about {XEU}2bn more than double last year's level Executives say the plan would also give the bank a clear sense of direction at a time when the bank as a whole is on the defensive We need a mission the headhunters are circling said one See Lex,2
2002-04-18, Manufacturers led criticism of the Budget last night claiming it did little to help parts of the economy suffering most from the global slowdown The chancellor concentrated much of his attention on small companies and had pre-announced the main business-friendly initiative relating to research and development tax credits Instead employers were shocked at the impact of national insurance changes and the general lack of support for business We are pretty disappointed said Martin Temple director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation The only benefits he announced are for businesses that are in profit whereas everyone has to endure higher costs from NI national insurance  Details of the research and development tax credits received mixed reactions The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the £450m package as a step in the right direction which would encourage big research spenders such as those in the pharmaceuticals industry to stay in the UK The Engineering Employers' Federation accused the government of bending to the big business lobby by rewarding existing spending and said it would have preferred credits focused on new R&D Among medium-sized companies there was little enthusiasm for the chancellor's speech Paul Broadhurst managing director of Technetix a West Sussex-based maker of telecommunications equipment said I found the Budget quite disappointing Mr Brown did not do much for manufacturers in terms of helping companies in areas such as disposal of waste or in helping with transport problems There was a lot of tinkering which to me did not add up to very much  However Mr Broadhurst was keen on the proposal to cut capital gains tax which he thought should make it more attractive for wealthy people to put funds into emerging businesses He also liked the research and development tax credit although was not sure whether his company would qualify for it In the past when the government has announced these schemes we have always found them so complicated we have not applied so we hope for something better this time Mr Broadhurst said Stuart Hall finance director of Durham-based PSI Global a maker of filters and similar products for process industries said the overall impact of the Budget for business was marginally negative He was disappointed with the chancellor's announcement of higher national insurance contributions An extra 1 per cent on employer and employee insurance costs will certainly make a difference to us and will outweigh the positive impact of the cut in corporation tax Mr Hall said More positively Mr Hall said he was pleased by the measures to encourage employee training The extra money for the NHS will not directly impact companies although we all know the NHS needs a shot in the arm  In another measure companies will be exempted from corporation tax on the sale of substantial shareholdings giving savings of £150m and from intellectual property tax giving savings of £200m a year Capital gains tax will also be cut to 20 per cent for business assets held for one year or more and to 10 per cent for assets held for more than two years ,3
2002-06-20, A consortium led by French conglomerate CGIP and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts the US private equity firm is set to seal a deal to buy Legrand the French electronics company from Schneider Electric Though the group has been granted the exclusive right to negotiate to buy Legrand the deal is not final and could still fall apart However if agreed it would be one of the biggest private equity deals in Europe and could go for up to {XEU}5bn $4 74bn After a {XEU}1 4bn write-down Schneider values Legrand at {XEU}4bn on its books Schneider wants the transaction to be pre-approved by the European Commission before it agrees to a deal In October the EC blocked the agreed merger of the two companies after Schneider had acquired most of Legrand's shares Schneider is thought to want to avoid falling foul of Brussels a second time The Commission had ordered Legrand be sold in one piece a condition that discouraged Siemens of Germany from making an offer but said it could be sold outright spun off to Schneider shareholders or refloated in a quasi initial public offering Legrand remains listed in Paris and 2 per cent is held by shareholders other than Schneider  It must be separated by the end of the year Because it cannot be broken up bidders teamed up to make the purchase The CGIP group also includes Candover and Chevrillon KKR recently closed a $5 1bn fund to target European acquisitions Private equity firms have been looking for big acquisition targets as a dearth of investment possibilities has left them flush with cash they need to invest lest investors ask for it back US private equity firm Madison Dearborn this week agreed to buy Jefferson Smurfit the Irish paper and packaging company for {XEU}3 7bn Rival private equity firms which could include Blackstone Group and Texas Pacific could try to buy into the equity to participate in the deal After a bidding war between private equity groups drove up the price for Eircom the Irish telecoms company private equity firms are reluctant to try to outbid each other ,1
2002-06-17, The federal government's decision to indict Andersen three months ago cost the accounting firm its biggest clients its global network of affiliates and many of its staff As a result Andersen's conviction on Saturday on charges that it impeded the investigation into the collapse of Enron the failed energy trader felt like the aftershock to a deadly earthquake adding insult to injury Andersen's business was already unravelling Even before the verdict the firm founded in 1913 by a Midwestern accounting professor whose motto was think straight and talk straight had become a pariah in the business community and fodder for television comedians poking fun at the rich and powerful Their name is certainly mud said Dan Guy who has run a consultancy following his 1998 retirement as vice-president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Andersen said it would appeal against the verdict but the firm acknowledged that the slow pace of that process would preclude it from getting back on its feet as a business A formal judgment of conviction in the case could be entered as early as August 31 Andersen told the Securities and Exchange Commission it would cease auditing corporate accounts by that day unless the SEC decided another date was more appropriate Formal sentencing is scheduled for October 11 Between now and August 31 the firm will be working actively to help transition its remaining clients to other accounting firms the Chicago-based firm said The SEC said Andersen could continue making filings on behalf of clients to minimise disruption to the markets but added it was allowing such activity as a temporary measure The commission said it was deeply troubled by the under-lying events that resulted in Andersen's conviction    asthe verdict reflects the jury's conclusion that Andersen engaged in conduct designed to obstruct SEC processes  The SEC added that its investigation into Enron's failure and Andersen's role in that event was continuing The case again highlighted the sensitivity of professional services firms to scandal Andersen came apart before it got a chance to defend itself in court a fact that made its defenders bitter Part of the problem was that Andersen had been associated with other accounting controversies in recent years including those involving Sunbeam and Waste Management Andersen paid a $7m fine to settle SEC charges arising from its audits of Waste Management a long-time client However the publicity surrounding the Enron collapse was unprecedented in US corporate history Wall Street is abuzz even today with talk of Enronitis a malady that is being blamed for the slow pace of dealmaking in the US An exodus of clients followed accusations that Andersen shredded documents in Houston in October to keep them out of the hands of federal investigators Before the verdict the firm had lost 700 of its biggest clients out of a total of 2300 The Houston office where the shredding occurred is already eerily silent Rows of desks that once were home to some of the city's respected accountants are empty Stacks of documents marked closed client files line the walls alongside hundreds of laptop computers and scraps of paper left behind in the rush of partners to competing firms Fewer than 500 of Andersen's 1700 Houston staff remain We're a fraction of what we were and we all know why said Patrick Dorton Andersen's spokesman adding We are going forward  Andersen said it would appeal against what it called only a technical conviction from the jury which at one point described itself as deadlocked Andersen said the trial was rife with flawed jury instructions and erroneous evidentiary rulings that precluded Andersen from presenting its entire defence Rusty Hardin who defended Andersen in court traced the firm's downfall to high-profile hearings that were held by Congress in January before the authorities had conducted a thorough investigation of their own It created an atmosphere of hysteria that Andersen could not get past Mr Hardin said Mr Hardin believes the authorities rushed to judgment against Andersen and commended the jury for not repeating that mistake regardless of what it eventually decided The 10 days of deliberation followed a five-week trial This jury has taken a more thorough approach to this case than our own government Mr Hardin said What has happened to this firm is an American tragedy  In that sense Andersen will live on as a symbol of the era even if it fails to remain an actual business The Enron failure and Andersen's role in it have changed the way auditors are perceived in US society Doug Carmichael director of the centre for integrity in financial reporting at the City University of New York said the controversy over the case had renewed interest in accounting and restoring the integrity in financial markets Seminars on accounting and the various issues raised by Andersen's demise are now packed For employees of Andersen the collapse was perhaps most striking for its speed Once one of the most revered names in global finance the thriving business fell apart in a matter of weeks Two months ago who would have thought we would be out of business today said Sam Stovall an Andersen technology manager in Houston who has been searching six weeks for a job We were booming ,3
2002-06-10, America Movil Latin America's largest cellular phone operator has unveiled an aggressive strategy in Brazil aimed at turning round the depressed wireless market in the country The Mexico-based company which assumed $1 9bn in debt after acquiring Bell Canada International's stake in Telecom Americas a Brazilian holding said it would honour $300m in short-term debt from the four Brazilian operators it controls by the end of the month Half of the amount has already been paid last week Carlos Garcia Moreno America Movil's finance director said the company would bring its total investment in Brazil close to $5bn with a fresh injection of $880m by the end of 2005 Further to its move on Bell Canada America Movil is also expected to increase its stake in Telecom Americas to 93 per cent by exercising its option to buy Southwestern Bell Corporation's 11 per cent stake in the company It intends to widen its customer base through quick expansion in pre-paid telephones Analysts believe it will gain enough scale to compensate a possible decline in average revenue per user Their model is very similar to Vodafone's They are building volume in order to negotiate lower prices with vendors and suppliers said Virgilio Freire a Brazilian telecoms consultant America Movil already has more than 25m customers in Latin America and is expected to fuel consolidation in the crisis-ridden wireless market in Brazil where Telecom Americas already controls operators in the interior of the state of Sao Paulo in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo south-east in Rio Grande do Sul south and in the Centre-West It has also declared its interest in three troubled companies including BCP a Sao Paulo operator which is facing debt repayment arrears of about $400m Telecom Americas is one of the two or three big players that will emerge in wireless here said Mr Freire Iberian groups Telefonica and Portugal Telecom which have a dominant position in the largest market in the south-east of Brazil plan to merge their cellular phone operations in coming weeks America Movil expects Telecom Americas to become profitable next year The Mexican operator is controlled by Carlos Slim a businessman reputed to be the wealthiest man in Latin America The Mexican financial market has reacted coolly to America Movil's expansion plans in Brazil Its shares lost more than 9 per cent of their value last week ,1
2002-04-20, Hundreds of millions of pounds in tax could be lost to the Treasury because of a rush of self-employed people registering themselves as companies to take advantage of changes in the Budget experts said yesterday The cut to zero in the tax rate for profits up to £10000 a year has enhanced the tax advantages of the smallest companies and the self- employed will from next year be hit by the 1p in the pound rise in their national insurance contributions David Bishop of the Federation of Small Business said There is a huge number of our members who will be tempted to become incorporated as a result of this Budget  Tax accountants have said they expect a flood of interest from publicans for example seeking to turn themselves into companies Incorporation has been a relatively attractive option since a lower 10 per cent tax rate for the smallest companies was introduced in 2000 But now the potential savings are even bigger John Whiting of PwC the professional services firm said It has been something that taxpayers should have been thinking about but the Budget has given it this extra spin right down the income scale  A self-employed person on £14000 a year could save almost £2700 a year in tax by registering as a company and dividing their income into £4500 wages and £9500 of profits both below the lower tax thresholds Even taking into account potential issues with pension contributions and keeping up a national insurance contribution record and an accountants' fee of about £500 a year the move is likely to repay the £150 cost of setting up a company within weeks The amount of revenue that the exchequer will lose this way is hard to assess but if a significant proportion of the 3 2m self-employed people took up the opportunity it could run into hundreds of millions of pounds Mr Whiting said it was possible that the finance bill to be published next week would set out measures to make incorporation less attractive for example by imposing a tax on dividends paid out of small company profits More than the revenue lost the objection for some tax experts is that the self-employed will be encouraged to set themselves up as companies solely for the tax advantages David Bishop of the FSB said For many of our members we don't think it would be the most suitable way to run their businesses because it means an increase in the amount of time spent dealing with red tape  Edward Troup head of tax strategy at Simmons and Simmons said My feeling is that this cut in small business taxation was simply a sweetener to soften the blow of the rise in NICs There is no economic rationale for it at all  Yesterday Patricia Hewitt trade secretary defended the rise in employers' NI contributions Almost everybody else in our country knows that if we are going to get a really good health system we have got to pay for it ,3
2002-04-17, President George W Bush and his advisers have proved unusually adept at hitching on to any kind of event in the world as a sudden and pressing justification for a policy they were trying to sell all along When the economy looked weak last year it was essential that Congress pass Mr Bush's enormous tax cut to stimulate demand When it turned this year the necessity remained big tax cuts because the budget could now stand it The stand-off with China a year ago over the downed US surveillance airplane showed how essential it was that the US develop a missile defence system to guard itself from states with ballistic missiles Then when terrorists attacked New York and Washington missile defence became an essential tool in the fight against terrorism Recently Mr Bush has been at it again with urgent new reasons why Congress should pass his producer-friendly energy bill First was the news that Saddam Hussein had imposed a 30-day embargo on oil exports Then came the proposal by Senate Republicans to ban imports of Iraqi oil The White House has indicated that the uncertainty of oil supplies from Iraq for whatever reason makes it essential that lawmakers agree to open up more domestic US oil production What more reason do we need    to have good energy policy in the United States to diversify away from somebody like him Mr Bush argued The president might have been better off had he stopped to ask why consideration of long-term US energy needs should be hijacked by the cynical posing of an embattled dictator But instead he chose to dress up a bill of questionable benefit in the guise of a central part of national security policy The Bush bill already passed in the House of Representatives will be debated in the Senate today It is not wholly flawed But for every sensible proposal for deregulating the nation's energy supply there are unnecessary measures for which the US would pay a high price in environmental damage The balance between conservation and production is entirely wrong The gains in US energy output to be had from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or other protected areas are dwarfed by the potential savings that could be had from a more sensible approach to conservation such as tougher fuel efficiency measures for cars The way to end US dependency on a global energy market that jumps every time Saddam Hussein sneezes is not by trying to compete with Iraqi oilfields in the production stakes It is through a coherent strategy to reduce the strains that outsized American energy consumption places on the rest of the world ,3
2002-06-11, Like a drunk driver who just barely missed a school bus the hedge fund industry reeled back from the horror of Long-Term Capital Management's near collapse in 1998 and then swore never to touch leverage again That year 16 banks lent an average of $5bn to LTCM in addition to entering into trillions of dollars of swaps with the hedge fund After Russia defaulted on its domestic debt LTCM's positions collapsed When the Federal Reserve and the fund's bank lenders finally got a chance to look at the fund's books they were horrified by what they saw Unless the fund was rescued from liquidation they feared it could drag down the whole financial system with it LTCM was rescued Afterwards leverage-hungry bond arbitrage funds shrunk or disappeared and banks learned to think twice about offering such huge amounts of money Congress took a look at hedge funds but finally did very little Now there are signs that leverage is returning What is worrying is not that bond arbitrage funds are once again popular They are after a year's strong results but probably not enough to threaten the world financial system again Nor is it too concerning that equity managers desperate for returns are using a little leverage That is probably worrying for the funds' investors than for the financial system as a whole But what perhaps ought to worry regulators is how much borrowed money investors are ploughing into the industry The Man Group's $500m of collateralised fund obligations and Investcorp's $250m launched in the last few weeks are just the most visible signs of the trend These deals work by offering investors leveraged but relatively low-risk investments through the magic of diversification The idea behind diversification is that different markets and different strategies tend not to go bad at the same time Because they invest in a highly diversified basket of hedge funds these structured securities can provide triple-A- or double-A-rated returns The only investors taking serious risks are the ones who hold the equity pieces the lowest-rated tranche of bonds in these multi-layered structures The ratings agencies have constructed thousands of similar structures backed by credit card auto leasing or mortgage payments That in itself ought to be reason for reassurance But diversification is not quite as magical as many risk managers would have you believe In September of 1998 LTCM was using diversification to protect its portfolio But what it found as the bond markets underwent unprecedented shocks is that even the most diverse markets correlate in crisis When hedge fund investors were forced to meet margin calls arising from the annihilation of their Russian bond holdings they sold liquid assets to raise cash As a result credit-worthy bonds such as off-the-run Treasuries and US agency debt dived in value The contagion also spread to the stock market LTCM had massive positions in equity index volatility bets that the European and US stock markets would move far less than the options markets predicted Those markets also exploded costing LTCM hundreds of millions of dollars Nor are these new products quite the same as the thousands of others that the ratings agencies have examined Rating agencies can crunch millions of credit cards and auto lease records to forecast how those bonds will perform But hedge fund data do not go back very far and is very patchy and hedge fund returns are highly unpredictable But it is not even these funds on their own that should really worry the hedge fund world The bigger red light is that they are part of a growing mountain of leverage that no one can totally quantify and that if drawn out of the market at the same time could generate similar problems to those experienced by LTCM In other words leveraged money could get pulled out of hedge funds in a time of crisis generating the kind of rush for the exit that Barton Biggs the Morgan Stanley strategist talked about when he warned about the existence of a hedge fund bubble The kind of rush many investors fear will take place in the highly concentrated convertible arbitrage market Prices which were already under pressure might suddenly go into freefall Some of the largest and most successful hedge funds such as Maverick and Citadel have realised the threat an unstable investor base could pose and have locked up their funding for several years Other less successful funds are not in a position to be so picky They regularly take in leveraged short-term money and sometimes they do not even know it One hedge fund investor recalls asking a hedge fund manager how much leveraged money he managed None the manager replied Later a competitor told the inquisitive investor I have got 20 per cent of my capital with him and I am levered four to one  That is reason enough to be worried ,2
1998-04-03, Despite yesterday's mysteriously cancelled announcement a massive armoured vehicle contract looks certain to fall into the Eurokonsortium's lap For GKN part of the largely German winning team that includes Mannesmann's Krauss-Maffei this is good news Its current order book is thin and there are no other programmes of this scale on the horizon After all scepticism about the usefulness of traditional tanks in modern warfare is rife in military circles Although profits will not filter through until 2004 the value of GKN's non-core defence business which is up for sale will nonetheless be increased This should enhance the company's position ahead of consolidation within the fragmented European armoured vehicle sector With Vickers part of the losing consortium and keen to expand in defence now Rolls-Royce is being sold an Anglo-British solution is possible GKN should be well placed to extract a better price than the £100m Vickers apparently rejected when the parties last talked Behind the delay lies French poker playing It seems likely that the reality of a dominant Anglo-German axis developing in land forces has goaded the French government into action GIAT a heavily loss-making and state-owned manufacturer is probably being given a larger slice of the action by its partners This looks less than ideal but could encourage greater French flexibility in other fields ,2

2002-06-19, International investor con-cern about a possible victory by the leftwing Workers' party in the October 6 presidential election has not spread to the majority of Brazilians who have preferred to focus on the World Cup and their soccer team's crucial game against England on Friday Opinion polls have been giving Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva a 20 percentage point lead over Jose Serra the government candidate Yet surveys are based on only 25 per cent of the electorate that has definitively decided on a candidate Opinion polls are almost meaningless at this point says Mailson de Nobrega a former finance minister Mr Lula has moderated his anti-market discourse and faces a lower rejection rate than he did during three previous elections even though he has failed to convince many investors Yet the key factors that will influence voters in coming weeks are more likely to benefit Mr Serra than Mr Lula analysts say By far the most important is free advertisement on radio and television which political parties are granted under electoral law Media time can make or break a candidate says Marcos Campomar marketing professor at the University of Sao Paulo Between August 20 and October 3 voters will be bombarded with 100 minutes daily of political commercials half of them by presidential candidates The renewal of an alliance at the weekend between the centrist PMDB party and the social democratic PSDB party will give Mr Serra about 40 per cent of free airtime Even an alliance with the small liberal PL party which was still in the balance yesterday would give Mr Lula only half as much In Brazil presidential nominees tend to benefit more from the support of local and state candidates rather than the other way around Even though the government alliance has been weakened by the departure of the rightwing PFL party earlier this year it still has the most powerful party machinery in most populous states argues Murillo de Aragao a political analysts in Brasilia A new electoral law requires parties to match their alliances for the presidency at a state and local level as well This effectively stops opposition PMDB leaders from formerly endorsing Lula and prevents the PFL from transferring its TV time to other presidential candidates The legislation favours the government alliance argues Rogerio Schmitt a Sao Paulo professor of politics Recent market turmoil and government warnings of an Argentine-style crisis in the event of an opposition victory may also scare voters into backing Mr Serra and his platform of economic continuity In particular middle-class voters and public sector workers considered a swing vote in the election may yet abandon Mr Lula While nearly half of Brazil's voters say they are looking for some type of change in the next government nearly three-quarters are also risk-averse unwilling to give up benefits of nearly eight years of inflation-control polls suggest Finally increased government spending and indirect campaigning by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso whose approval rating is at its highest level since April 2001 are likely to benefit Mr Serra The government for instance is issuing more than 4m citizen cards in coming weeks which entitle the poor to numerous social welfare programmes While all this should favour Mr Serra he still faces a number of challenges His lack of charisma is a serious handicap says Mr de Aragao Mr Lula may still assuage investor concerns by clarifying uncertainties over his economic proposals As more voters choose their candidates in coming weeks opinion polls will gain forecasting power Yet few investors expect much certainty as a result There would have to be a real upset by Serra in order to sleep well at night let alone recommend buying Brazil says Arturo Porzecanski chief emerging market economist with ABN Amro in New York For regional reports www ft com/americas,3
2002-06-12, The consensus among economists was once that the Federal Reserve would not begin raising short-term interest rates until last January Then it was April Now the expectation is September after Alan Greenspan suggested in mid-April that the end of the Fed's wait-and-see period would come in two to four months Ahead of today's release of the Fed's beige book which summarises regional economic conditions speculators seem to be pushing back the probable date of monetary tightening yet again Financial markets have registered expectations of the US central bank waiting even longer to think about raising short-term rates from 40-year lows after the turmoil of the past year Futures prices show expectations that the Fed funds rate the overnight lending rate between banks is likely to rise by no more than a quarter point by October down sharply from the full percentage point increase expected as recently as April Most economists still think the Fed will raise rates in 2002 and futures markets continue to price in strong odds that Fed funds will go up a half point to 2 25 per cent by the end of the year But even those expectations have been weakening for months Meanwhile the consensus among economists for a solid recovery and higher short-term interest rates appears to be unravelling Disturbed by the crisis of investor confidence worried that the still struggling economy might not be able to weather more shocks yet reassured by comments issued by Fed officials over the past few weeks a growing number of economists think the Fed might not raise rates at all this year Rate increases were perceived by the markets as a virtual lock just a month ago but there has been a dramatic backing off in expectations said Dan Granbacher an economist who closely monitors futures markets for the Chicago Board of Trade Even though corporate profits appear to be rebounding from last year's downturn businesses remain reluctant to spend money Companies feel their profit margins under pressure and future sales uncertain Lay- offs have slowed but the number of American residents receiving unemployment benefits continues to rise Meanwhile Fed officials have suggested they are in no hurry to raise interest rates said Richard Berner an economist with Morgan Stanley Mr Greenspan said the Fed's outlook had not materially changed since January when it said the outlook for household and business spending remained uncertain However expectations could reverse quickly if stock prices or inflation rebounded Reports this week on regional economic conditions industrial production retail sales consumer confidence and wholesale and import prices could reinforce or weaken the latest turn in sentiment ,2
2002-06-17, At the height of the stock market bubble talking about the paltry dividend yield guaranteed a funny look The yield on the S&P 500 was at a historical low but capital appreciation meant that equity returns were in double digits Following two years of negative capital returns mentioning the dividend yield can still bring a quizzical response The yield on the S&P 500 is about 1 5 per cent compared with a postwar average of about 4 per cent Plugging 1 5 per cent into a simple dividend discount model leads to fairly shocking results But during the 1990s annual share repurchases amounted to about 2 per cent of market capitalisation each year Do share buy-backs fill the gap Only up to a point The contribution share repurchases make to an adjusted dividend yield and the reasons for the shift away from dividend payments bear closer examination particularly the relationship between stock buy-backs and options During the past 20 years share buy-backs have grown at a rate about three times as fast as dividends In 1999 US companies spent more on buy-backs than on dividends Eugene Fama and Kenneth French have shown that during the past 20 years the proportion of S&P 500 companies that paid dividends dropped from 67 to 21 per cent  Half of that they say is explained by the changing composition of the S&P 500 But half of it reflects a disinclination to pay dividends Why is that The fact that dividends are taxed at the higher income tax rate along with more permissive regulation has encouraged substitution It is more tax efficient to return cash by buying shares Share repurchases also offer more flexibility For investors raising and cutting the dividend is marriage and divorce Increasing and decreasing share repurchases is dating and getting dumped But firms also have to repurchase stock to offset share creep According to Morgan Stanley strategists in the late 1990s Oracle IBM Hewlett-Packard Intel Verizon Citigroup Merck and Ford were among the 15 heaviest buyers of stock in the S&P 500 They were also among the 15 heaviest issuers of stock In terms of an adjusted dividend yield what matters is not gross share repurchases but net share retirement Paying Peter to provide for Paul's share options does not help continuing shareholders Timing is also important Stock option awards may also directly bias payout policy Options reward managers for capital appreciation not dividend payments That provides an incentive to use cashflow to repurchase shares James Montier global strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said the executives who are most weighed down with share options are also most likely to repurchase shares rather than paying dividends Since stock is bought back at market prices and issued to executives at a discount there is also a transfer of wealth Nellie Liang and Steven Sharpe economists at the US Federal Reserve Board show that between 1994 and 1998 the gross annual repurchase of shares averaged about 2 per cent of market capitalisation  However largely owing to stock options half those shares were not retired The net yield was only 1 per cent Add to that the dividend yield which averaged about 2 per cent and that gives a 3 per cent adjusted dividend yield According to Liang and Sharpe's updated figures in 1999 the net retirement yield dropped to 0 36 per cent and in 2000 it was -0 07 per cent a slight net issuance of stock This year the net retirement yield will be close to zero What can investors expect Even if the fashion for options ebbs with greater shareholder vigilance a lot of options have been issued on soft terms Based on reasonable assumptions Liang and Sharpe estimate that the long-term net retirement yield will be about 0 5 per cent If that is right then plugging a 2 per cent adjusted dividend yield into a dividend discount model makes US stocks look expensive There are four ways that the yield might rise Companies could cut investment below historical norms and/or take on more debt More positively they might find ways to generate more cash Alternatively since the dividend yield and net retirement yield are measured relative to market capitalisation falling share prices could do the work  Disappearing Dividends Changing Form Characteristics or Lower Propensity to Pay 2000 http//papers ssrn com  Share Repurchases and Employee Stock Options and their Implications for S&P 500 Share Retirements and Expected Returns 1999 www federalreserve gov/ pubs/feds/1999 andrew balls@ft com,2

2002-04-13, The US Treasury secretary said yesterday that there could be many exemptions from the US steel tariffs but there would be no special favours for any one country Paul O'Neill said about 1000 requests for exemptions to the steel tariffs were being looked at Exemptions would be made on an individual meritorious basis but he believed a significant portion of the requests would be favourably decided He indicated that Britain could expect no special favours in the steel trade row despite the UK's close co-operation with its ally on measures to crack down on the financing of alleged terrorist groups Mr O'Neill blamed production overcapacity of 35 per cent as the heart of the trade dispute sparked by the US's decision to impose tariffs of up to 30 per cent on imports The worldwide steel industry had destroyed value and failed to earn its cost of capital over the past 40 years he added The trade row would only be diffused once there were moves to bulldoze capacity he said Some of it is environmentally repugnant Some is able to survive only because it is the subject of subsidies of one kind or another There are subsidies and bankruptcy reorganisations that effectively wipe away capital cost he said Gordon Brown who met Mr O'Neill in London yesterday said they had held vigorous discussions on steel We musn't lose sight of the fact that we must remove barriers and whatever the individual dispute the long-term aim is to break down regulatory hurdles the chancellor said The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is to meet in Paris next week for discussions that will include talks on the closure of in-efficient capacity The European Commission is preparing contingency plans to retaliate against US trade restrictions possibly by June 18 if the US refuses to compensate the EU for lost steel trade ,3
2002-06-28, Real estate long the alternative asset class has come into its own With stock and bond markets across the globe plumbing their lowest levels in years property shines In the UK and indeed across much of continental Europe as well property is shaping up to be the best performing asset class over one- three- five- and 10-year periods by the end of 2002 Property isn't the alternative asset class any more says Mike Prew real estate equities analyst at Schroder SalomonSmithBarney It's the third asset class  What else are you going to put your money into asks Iain Reid chief executive of Aberdeen Property Investors International a pan-European fund manager And when investors choose property increasingly they want to do it through indirect vehicles quoted or unquoted allowing them more choice about markets lot sizes and asset types than they could ever possibly achieve through direct investment This trend has spawned a growing and increasingly professional industry of specialist property fund managers According to a new report prepared by analysts at Investment Property Databank and sponsored by investment bank ABN Amro investors are charging into real estate through these vehicles as never before Data in the May report show that in the three years to December 2001 investment in European real estate funds more than quadrupled from {XEU}6bn to {XEU}28bn a compound annualised growth rate of 66 per cent What is really driving the growth of these funds are push-factors and pull-factors said Phillip Rose European Head of Real Estate at ABN Amro The factors pulling people out of quoted property equities or direct ownership are first a desire to outsource management to specialists second investors want access to the benefits of gearing third investors want to focus on individual sectors and choose managements who are specialists in key product types and fourth they want access to large lot sizes The ABN Amro/IPD study suggests that these indirect vehicles are no panacea indeed property fund managers earned returns lower than those of the relevant IPD indices on property And what outperformance they did achieve was largely from the use of modest gearing However in trying to understand why capital is flowing into these funds with such speed it is necessary to look not just at performance relative to the IPD universe but to the quoted sector And although these partnerships and funds underperformed IPD they outperformed the FTSE real estate shares total return index by a similar margin In other words for all their weaknesses they are still better vehicles for investment than what is available on average in the quoted sector The shift in the way capital is allocated to real estate has not escaped the attention of property company managements Those who believe they have specialist expertise to offer are setting up funds and seeking third party investors managing these assets with their own A host of corporates from ProLogis the US-based warehouse specialist to Kleppiere the French retail developer to Pillar the UK-based retail parks and London office specialist have launched funds aimed at attracting capital from institutional investors This industry has been significantly sponsored by property companies who are emerging as stakeholders Mr Rose says It is an issue for the new capital model which is emerging  However corporates are only the latest to spearhead new ventures in real estate fund management Opportunity funds many of them run by US investment banks who cashed in on the collapse in real estate markets in the US in the early 1990s have been aggressively raising funds for property investment in Europe Analysts at Goldman Sachs calculate that roughly $16bn or $25bn assuming a typical 65 per cent gearing ratio has been raised from typical US pension and charitable funds for real estate investment via private equity-type structures Even more traditional property fund management groups have sought to raise their profile in order to attract perceived demand from investors who may want to invest in property but have found impediments in the structures Several of the UK's largest managers of Unauthorised Property Unit Trusts a product limited by definition to tax-exempt investors have moved their funds offshore to Jersey in order to make them tax-transparent for retail or other taxable investors And a plethora of funds are being launched by specialist managers such as Close Brothers and Matrix Securities in the UK tailored to the needs of wealthy private investors Mr Reid says the reason for the explosion in the number of property vehicles is not just that investors have woken up to its merits as an asset class It is also driven by the increasingly global outlook of most institutional investors whose interest in international investment is driven as much by the need to diversify risk as it is to obtain outperformance He points out that for the past 30 years investors have periodically swept into foreign real estate markets Without exception they bombed he notes Now investors have learned that the safest way to achieve international diversification is to choose a local fund manager who offers a vehicle for indirect investment They don't need liquidity across their whole investment portfolio he notes And investment in property through an indirect vehicle with a manager specialising in both the geographical location and the specific asset class is the safest and most rewarding way to achieve that ,2
2002-06-12, When Barilla the Italian pasta group launched a hostile bid for Kamps the German bakery chain in mid-April shareholder rights activists held their breath With Germany's new takeover law barely four months old shareholder protection groups sensed their chance to prove that the new legislation deprived them of one of their key rights that of opposing a hostile takeover Two months later Kamps has in the meantime agreed to a friendly takeover by Barilla shareholder activists acknowledge they will have to wait for the next flurry of merger and acquisition deals before they can prove they have been short-changed Germany has moved a few centimetres in the right direction but it is still kilometres away from internationally accepted Anglo-Saxon shareholder rights standards says Reinhild Keitel a board member of the Schutzgemeinschaft fur Kleinaktionare one of Germany's biggest shareholder rights groups She says the new takeover law has become exemplary for German shareholder rights The new law is completely lopsided towards the management It has large shortcomings  Late last year after almost a decade of haggling within the European Union to create a pan-European takeover law the German government caused the collapse of the project and later created its own domestic takeover law Most importantly and to the distress of Mrs Keitel the law allows the management with the backing of the supervisory board to implement defence measures or launch poison pills in a hostile situation without ever consulting its shareholders That is very regrettable for shareholders she says Besides being completely outdated by Anglo-Saxon standards such practices do German companies a disservice and maintain the notion that Fortress Germany is still alive shareholder groups say Despite her criticism Mrs Keitel admits that the takeover law despite its shortcomings marks a bit of progress This is particularly true when it is seen as part of a bigger picture Granted Germany has come a long way in the past few years In spring even Volkswagen one of the country's most old-fashioned and opaque companies bid farewell to Germany's beloved HGB accounting standard when it presented its full-year earnings according to international standards Finally all of Germany's leading Dax 30 blue-chip companies have fully transferred their accounting to international or US standards Unlike many of its European neighbours Germany has also all but abolished multiple voting rights golden shares and other poison pill defences The only exception is the state of Lower Saxony which continues to hold 20 per cent of Volkswagen and can prevent any other groups from doing so The German government too has contributed its part to tear down Deutschland AG a term that describes the cosy relationship between banks companies and politicians On January 1 it abolished capital gains tax So far the new law has caused fewer-than-expected banks or companies to sell their industrial stakes mostly because of depressed financial markets Mrs Keitel welcomed the initiative to dissolve such decade-long relationships between companies and their large corporate stakeholders Finally there is Germany's new corporate governance code It was created in an attempt to defuse the international criticism that German companies lack transparency and fail to consult shareholders on vital decisions Although voluntary in nature the code is supported by a separate law that forces German companies to say whether they abide by it or not Widely hailed as a step in the right direction shareholder groups criticise it for its voluntary nature It is a big marketing instrument which allows companies to pretend that shareholders have the same rights as in other countries she says In that sense it is almost sweet  When Rolf Breuer the departing Deutsche Bank chief executive bid farewell to shareholders in late May he revealed that he was paid nearly {XEU}8m last year Hailed as a rare break with the country's traditional secrecy most shareholders considered Mr Breuer's gesture a breakthrough ,1

2002-04-16, NTL the cable company with $17bn £11 9bn of debt was last night close to clinching a deal that will set out the terms for one of the biggest bond defaults in corporate history The agreement with a committee of NTL's biggest bondholders over the terms of a debt-for-equity swap is expected to be announced this week NTL's lending banks which need to approve any restructuring package are expected to take longer to sign off the deal Some disagree over the funding and structure of some of NTL's European networks The bondholder deal could come as early as today when the company is due to file its 2001 annual return with the Securities Exchange Commission in the US The SEC documents will provide an update on the debt restructuring separate from any formal announcement that could still be held up according to people close to the situation The deal with a committee controlling a majority of NTL's $11bn bonds will pave the way for bondholders to take control of NTL its short-term financing and probably its board after a restructuring process Bondholders will be asked to swap their bonds for new NTL shares understood to be represent at least 95 per cent of the value of the restructured company Some bondholders will provide NTL with short-term cash of up to $500m This will leave shareholders with less than 5 per cent To be put into action the deal will need the support of a majority usually two-thirds of funds holding each bond issue NTL's minority bondholders have not been directly involved in the talks and have yet to see the terms of any offer or until today's SEC filing a complete picture of NTL's net debt and cash at the end of 2001 They could still vote against the deal NTL yesterday refused to comment on the timing of an announcement As part of the agreement it is expected to announce its intention to put its US-registered businesses into Chapter 11 Following its decision on April 1 to withhold payment of interest on some of its key bonds and enter a 30-day grace period the company will formally default on some of its main bonds Analysts estimate this could cover $9bn-$10bn of high-yield debt issued by NTL with other bonds unimpaired The fate of NTL's management including Barclay Knapp chief executive and John Gregg chief finance officer will be in bondholders' hands While minority bondholders have called for changes the big funds that make up the committee have been more cautious ahead of any deal Noos stake Page 27,2

2002-06-06, For Nasdaq the second largest US stock market the next few months will be crucial By September it is expected to launch its new high-powered trading system SuperMontage Soon after legions of stock dealers will decide whether to stay with it or take their business elsewhere Many in the market say Nasdaq needs to roll out a flawless new execution system If the technology fails Nasdaq's troubles will mount considerably The threat of losing at least some of its market to rival electronic communications networks or other exchanges is real but not yet certain The catalyst for such changes comes down to two factors Nasdaq has moved aggressively in recent years to change its ownership structure and upgrade its systems with some of the best features of the electronic communications network and electronic trade matching platforms In turn rival ECNs that offer their own stock execution services while still operating within the Nasdaq system have been forced to consolidate or go into partnership with others Until recently such combinations have not amounted to much of athreat That changed last month with a report that two of the largest ECNs Island and Instinet had re-opened merger discussions Even without an Instinet/ Island combination the anticipation of one may give each more leverage to win concessions from Nasdaq on how it operates SuperMontage Island and Instinet have a combined liqudity of just over 20 per cent of Nasdaq stock trading A merger followed by a decision to leave Nasdaq in effect creating their own independent market or linking up with another exchange would create a big though not insurmountable problem for Nasdaq For the moment the exchange remains at the centre of trading in the stocks it lists Even if all nine ECNs broke from Nasdaq tomorrow it would still be left with 60 to 70 per cent of the trading liquidity an important lure to keep market makers posting trades there The combination of Island and Instinet has its own risks Culturally the two are bitter rivals with very different business models Island has made its mark as a low-cost provider of very fast electronic trade matches Its success has forced Instinet and Nasdaq to re-evaluate and cut their own fees so as not to lose liquidity Island has also forged a unique partnership with the Cincinnati Stock Exchange in which it offers market makers huge rebates for some trading services It competes on speed and price and in a tough economic environment it has outpaced Instinet among alternatives to Nasdaq Instinet which is 83 per cent owned by Reuters of the UK relies on trade executions for only part of its revenues The rest is made up in analytical and other services it sells to institutions as a package For years Instinet thrived as it charged a premium for its trading services but in recent months it has been forced to slash its fees Underscoring its mounting troubles Douglas Atkin Instinet's longtime chief executive stepped down in April Two weeks later Instinet reported a net loss for the first quarter of $34 7m and a 37 per cent fall in revenues from the previous year The question for Nasdaq is whether it can continue to slash trading costs and remain competitive with the ECNs without destroying its own business model Wick Simmons the former Prudential executive who has been Nasdaq's chairman for just under a year has not veered far from the structural changes put in place by Frank Zarb his predecessor Mr Simmons is convinced he can transform Nasdaq from a utility-style market to a lean and mean profitable business with eventually its own initial public offering As a sign of its independence it is soon expected to sever all financial ties with its founding parent the National Association of Securities Dealers It is clear that Nasdaq will have to branch out into new forms of trading and Mr Simmons may be the ambitious Wall Streeter to manage such changes There are several options The first is that SuperMontage is expected to include trading in stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange through its own SuperMontage system This move could provide a real boost to Nasdaq's trading liquidity but again the success of such a move is tied to the quality of SuperMontage Another option would be a link-up or merger with a big European exchange Late last year Mr Simmons said he thought such an arrangement would be probable within a year A likely partner would be the London Stock Exchange A Nasdaq/ LSE merger would be groundbreaking but to guarantee its success executives would have to convince the trading community on both sides of the Atlantic of the advantages of such a cross-border marketplace It is the traders who will have the final say ,1
2002-06-14, The stakes in this year's gubernatorial race in Florida are higher than usual The Democratic party is striving to unseat Governor Jeb Bush brother of President George W Bush and assuage their members' anger over the controversial vote count in the 2000 presidential election Republicans want to win the first re-election of a Republican governor and secure the state for President Bush's re-election bid in 2004 But as the adage goes all politics are local and the contest here is largely being fought on education In polls voters have called improving education their priority and only about 40 per cent approve of Governor Bush's performance on the issue More troubling for Governor Bush is that the Florida Chamber of Commerce the largest business association in the state is critical of the quality of public education Echoing the business community's demand for better education in many southern states the chamber's top priority for public policy for the last three years has been workforce development and education The need for a prepared workforce has reached crisis proportions in Florida according to the chamber which includes such companies as Walt Disney Citigroup Bell South First Union and Verizon Like many southern states Florida is struggling to move its economy towards high-technology and other information-driven industries which require more qualified workers Tourism is now the state's largest industry A chamber report on education said that Florida's public schools fell in the national rankings during the 1990s and state spending per student was a significant reason While Governor Bush only took office in 1999 the report has fueled campaign debate on the issue At the end of the 1990s Florida ranked 46th out of 50 states in the nation for graduating young people from high school which meant that only 56 per cent of those who entered high school graduated four years later The Bush campaign says that the graduation rate rose to 64 per cent last year Critics say the state's spending per student has also steadily fallen It fell by $300 £204 from 1991-2001 pushing the state from 21st position in spending to 42nd in the nation Tony Welch of the Florida Education Association whose 122000 members have endorsed Democratic primary contender Bill McBride says Class sizes are larger teachers are paid $5000 less than the national average and state funding for education has actually gone down  In his recently approved budget for 2002-2003 Governor Bush has attempted to redress education spending with a $1bn increase or a 6 per cent per student increase in absolute dollars for the fiscal year While the public's reviews of Governor Bush on education are mixed voters give him credit for trying according to Brad Coker of Mason-Dixon Polling and Research He does not see education as a silver bullet for the Democrats Mr Bush's overall favourable approval rating has stood at 53-54 per cent for the last year says Mr Coker whose company released new polling results this week The governor agrees that public school education is not where we need to be said Todd Harris his campaign communications director But he adds We've taken steps  Governor Bush has focused his initial campaign advertising on education In television spots Mr Bush says I want education to be Florida's highest calling  Part of Governor Bush's education programme has been pressing schools to perform better by rating them based on student test results However he instituted a controversial system of $3500 vouchers to pay for private education of children in schools that fail twice in four years The voucher programme is unpopular with voters and promises to add heat to the campaign This week 68 schools in the state failed and a record 10 failed twice making their students eligible for vouchers Former US attorney-general Janet Reno who is fighting for the Democratic nomination to run against Mr Bush criticised the programme Taking dollars out of those schools for voucher programmes is not the answer Ms Reno said She also criticised Governor Bush for giving companies a $262m tax break this year saying the funds would have been better devoted to education and early childhood programmes to prepare children for school Governor Bush who has been occupied in recent months with getting his budget through a balky Republican-dominated legislature has not been campaigning as fervently as he did in 1994 when he lost and in 1998 when he won Now that the legislature is adjourned he is expected to hit the hustings with a Republican party war chest three times as big as that of the Democrats Bob Poe chairman of the Florida Democratic party is not deterred He says the Republicans always outspend us Come this autumn when students head back to school voters will have their say For regional reports www ft com/usa,3
2002-06-08, From Mr Michael Tracy Sir We know that for many Americans socialism is a dirty word It is to be hoped nevertheless that some Americans appreciate that the thoughtful weekly contributions by Michael Prowse far from being the tired socialism of which Mr Adam Mikkelsen complains Letters June 1 are a vital corrective to unbridled free marketeering not to mention the brashness of How to Spend It magazine Michael Tracy B-1474 Genappe Belgium From Mr Kris Olds Sir The low point of last weekend's FT was surely Mr Adam Mikkelsen's letter Suffice it to say that the underlying philosophy of his argument is encapsulated in the interview with James Carville A warrior tamed in the same issue As Mr Carville noted Republicans believe that if something is good for the powerful it's good for the country  Kris Olds Madison WI 53705 US,3
2002-06-17, Pirelli & C Real Estate There can be no denying the strength of investor interest in the Italian property market Office and retail demand has been buoyant in Milan Rome and other cities The problem for the international investor is obtaining access Beni Stabili has been a star performer but the quoted options are limited Pirelli & C Real Estate has come up with an innovative plan to remedy that but the complexity of its proposals are daunting It hopes to take advantage of a change in Italian law passed but still awaiting final clearance reducing the tax burden on closed-end property funds To benefit from the eventual change in the law Pirelli is to combine a large chunk of its assets with those of Olivetti/Telecom Italia and funds managed by affiliates of Morgan Stanley Pirelli would have a minority stake in two real estate portfolio companies It would exchange short-term portfolios for a more stable 15-20 year investment horizon But as a minority shareholder it would not have complete control of its portfolio companies Apart from property ownership much of Pirelli's income comes from providing property services to its own investments and third parties This split complicates the valuation The company has announced a price range of {XEU}26-{XEU}31 5 for a total value of {XEU}950m-{XEU}1 15bn The top of the range figure assumes a sector comparable discount of 17 5 per cent to net assets of {XEU}1 04bn and a modest multiple of 15 times 2002 services and asset management earnings of about {XEU}19m A mid-range valuation could be expected to give a dividend yield of 4-4 5 per cent Alongside the complexity of the structure Pirelli has to contend with the opacity of the Italian property sector and the stickiness of the European IPO market Investors should push for the bottom of the range ,2
2002-06-11, The foot and mouth outbreak in the UK last year has had a profound impact on the markets for New Zealand lamb in Europe Brian Lynch of the New Zealand Meat Industry Association said that with the British unable to export to Europe they had been forced to sell at home This had reduced sales of New Zealand lamb in Britain historically the biggest market by 12 per cent However the absence of British lamb in France and Germany had enlarged the markets there Sales of New Zealand lamb to France were up by 40 per cent to 33000 tonnes and were also sharply higher to Germany and other European countries Exporters say New Zealand is on track to fill its 226700 tonne quota of lamb to the European Union this year This is despite worrying shortages of stock that have led some New Zealand processing companies to lay off workers Mr Lynch says sales to Europe for the first four months of this year were 117000 tonnes almost the same as the same period of last year Sales of the higher value chilled lamb were up 9 per cent to just under 20000 tonnes This implies New Zealand will sell close to 40000 tonnes this year up from 35000 tonnes in 2001 The New Zealand industry is carefully managing the export of chilled lamb to Europe to avoid raising political sensitivities Chilled lamb is virtually indistinguishable from European fresh meat The powerful European farmers' lobby is concerned about the threat of New Zealand chilled product competing with their own production There was a shortage of lamb coming forward for slaughter in New Zealand for a number of reasons Rob Davison of the Meat and Wool Board's economic service said The fall was mainly due to the drought that hit large parts of the country hard during the late 1990s and 2000 year He said good export returns for lamb mutton and beef and a helpful lift in wool prices late in the season had put the average livestock farmer in the best financial position for 25 years Good production levels have been maintained through the season with much of the country enjoying favourable weather Mr Davison said these factors coupled with hopes of another good season to come had encouraged many farmers to restock or hold back animals for herd or flock rebuilding especially in South Island regions recovering from drought Other animals had been retained on farms as they are not in good condition While there has been ample grass lack of summer sun meant it was not especially nutritious This encouraged farmers to keep them for further finishing before they were sent to be slaughtered ,2
1998-04-03, Hong Kong yesterday took an unconvincing first step in its maiden post-colonial elections Just 23 per cent of eligible voters turned up to choose an election committee The election process has been criticised as complicated and undemocratic Yesterday's exercise will help create an 800-strong committee which will in turn choose 10 legislators for the 60-strong parliament Emily Lau leader of the pro-democracy Frontier party which staged a protest against the election said the low turn-out reflected confusion and disillusionment Just 2 per cent of the populace representing religious labour and professional groups were eligible to vote yesterday There were 963 candidates chasing 588 seats to add to the 212 already allocated Elections for the Legislative Council or parliament became increasingly democratic in the final years of British rule In the final colonial election of 1995 20 seats representing geographical constituencies were open to popular vote the remaining 40 were restricted to voters qualified by profession or by election to neighbourhood councils Under the current arrangements those enfranchised by virtue of their occupation the so-called functional constituencies have shrunk from 2m before the handover to about 230000 but the 20 geographically elected seats remain the same However these will be contested under proportional representation rather than the first-past-the-post system The government while conceding turnout in yesterday's elections was low stressed it was a fair and transparent election But Ms Lau criticised the government for not communicating their methods to the electorate While calling for people to cast their votes in the direct elections on May 24 for a new legislature she predicted turnout would again be low  The Hong Kong government yesterday moved to quell growing concern that a new bill would put mainland bodies above the law The government said that in adapting laws to reflect the new sovereign power it was simply continuing a time-honoured legal practice to make exemptions Concerns that Xinhua the official Chinese news agency would be exempt from privacy bills could always be challenged in court the administration added ,3

2002-06-21, The prospect of the re-election of the centre left Labour government in a little over a month does not seem to be worrying investors with the New Zealand market trading around two year highs The market is being supported by strong offshore interest which according to a senior Wellington broker is running at levels last seen in the early 1990s Much of this appears to be money diverted from the US looking for a more stable environment he said The NZSE Top 40 index hit an intra-day high of 2166 on Tuesday the highest level since August 15 2000 So far this year this index has risen 4 6 per cent to close at 2148 9 yesterday Overseas interest has been fuelled by the rise in the New Zealand dollar which has risen by up to 14 per cent from last year's lows This has been encouraged by high yields on both shares and bonds While both have slipped from levels seen last year they remain high by world standards Overseas people see other positives The Labour Party after a shaky start has had some success in reassuring many in the investment community that it is not anti-business though some remain unconvinced It has adopted orthodox economic policies including maintaining substantial budget surpluses and kept spending under control Labour has a substantial lead in opinion polls and hopes to govern alone However as the July 27 election day nears financial markets could become more unsettled There is a chance the Greens could become a coalition partner Solid economic growth and positive profits are also reinforcing confidence in the equity market Through a happy combination of circumstances New Zealand has weathered the global problems of the past two years remarkably well This has been helped by the market having minimal exposure to the IT sector while the undervalued dollar for much of the past two years has boosted earnings for the export sector Forestry company Carter Holt Harvey is an example of the way overseas investors who shunned New Zealand for much of the late 1990s in favour of Wall Street have been reinvesting Since January Carter Holt Harvey's price has risen from NZ$1 70 to NZ$2 11 yesterday a gain of 24 1 per cent Since May 26 some 4 per cent of its capital has changed hands This is a sizeable percentage as 50 4 per cent is effectively locked up by the controlling shareholder International Paper of New York Telecom New Zealand the biggest listed company has risen 10 3 per cent this year to NZ$5 23 yesterday This is in spite of expectations that the major shareholder Verizon formerly Bell Atlantic is about to sell its 20 4 per cent stake to reduce debt and uncertainty how this transaction will be carried out Booming consumer spending has boosted support for retail stocks The Warehouse the country's biggest retailer has risen 20 1 per cent this year to close at NZ$7 70 yesterday though this was down following profit-taking The Warehouse hit a record NZ$7 90 earlier this week Terry Hall,2
2002-06-21, The star pupil has become the problem child General Electric's power systems division the company's biggest industrial unit and an impressive performer since the late 1990s is starting to cause headaches on account of an expected big fall-off in sales and earnings in the next few years How the division reacts to a fall in orders for electricity-producing gas turbines a field in which GE is the world's biggest supplier will test its ability to meet external challenges and expand in the face of adversity Headquartered in Atlanta Georgia the power systems operation employs more than 30000 and had sales last year of $20 2bn As well as large gas turbines complex machines that can cost up to $30m it makes a range of smaller electricity generating machinery and oil and gas processing equipment It also derives 30 per cent of its revenues from services such as maintenance contracts for existing power stations or remote telemonitoring to check the plants are operating satisfactorily While the expected downturn in the gas turbine business will harm the division's impressive earnings record John Rice president of the division is confident it can get back on track by increasing its sales outside the US the strongest market for power equipment of late and which in 2001 accounted for about 60 per cent of the GE unit's sales He also wants to increase the proportion of the division's sales coming from services to 50 per cent by later this decade largely by improved marketing and through new software and instrumentation technologies that allow better monitoring of plants Mr Rice is also looking out for more acquisitions that have helped to fuel the unit's expansion since 1998 when its revenues were just $8 5bn In the past two years alone it has bought more than 30 companies around the world with a strong interest in ventures based on new technology It has also plunged into wind power for the first time by acquiring the wind energy operations of Enron the failed energy trader That puts GE among the biggest six producers of wind turbines GE has known for some time that its power systems division would have to respond to the bursting of the so-called turbine bubble in the US Orders for gas turbines in the US suddenly spurted in 1998 and remained high until late last year driven by shortages of power in western US states and a spate of under-investment GE was by some way the biggest beneficiary of the surge in demand It has about 60 per cent of the world market for gas turbines which last year provided revenues to GE of about $8bn with Siemens of Germany second with 25 per cent The fourfold increase in US demand for gas turbines produced an enormous boost to the GE unit's earnings The subsidiary's operating profits of $1 1bn in 1998 rose to $4 9bn last year and according to GE's own forecasts will reach $5 9bn this on sales of $23 5bn But the next few years do not look so good GE's projections suggest divisional operating profits will drop to $4 4bn in 2003 and $3 6bn in 2004 on falling sales To some extent GE is the victim of its own success The unit's operating margin of 24 per cent last year is way ahead of the comparable figures for the equivalent divisions of Siemens and Alstom of just 7 and 4 per cent respectively Even with the fall-off projected for the next few years the margins are expected to remain much higher than its rivals Also GE's ability to increase production of power equipment to meet the big increase in demand in 1998 was primarily the result of the introduction of new lean manufacturing and quality improvement techniques such as Six Sigma at GE's biggest gas turbine factory in Greenville South Carolina in 1996 Here GE is acknowledged to be some way ahead of both Siemens and Alstom As for the next few years both European companies are also planning a big increase in service revenues However GE may suffer in its ability to push up sales outside the US on account of its relatively low market shares in regions such as Europe and South America How the GE unit fares in such markets will indicate to what degree the world's biggest company can do well in bad times as well as good ,2
2002-06-03, Siemens the German electronics and engineering group is planning to change the image of its mobile phone unit according to Rudi Lamprecht group chairman and head of ICM the cellular arm Mr Lamprecht told Financial Times Deutschland that the change in marketing strategy for ICM will inevitably change the brand image of Siemens as a whole Our new marketing campaign will be more event-driven and people-oriented more like a classic consumer brand Our strategy will have to focus on and learn from companies such as Coca-Cola or PepsiCo This is completely new to Siemens said Mr Lamprecht Consumer goods companies such as Coca-Cola or Unilever typically spend more than 10 per cent of revenues on marketing We will therefore invest more in marketing than on R&D  ICM's new marketing strategy is a reaction to a change in the sector as a whole according to Mr Lamprecht The mobile telephony market will take a new shape The market at the moment looks like an egg with small lower and higher-price segments but a big middle-price segment In the future the market will look more like an hour-glass with a stronger polarisation that is with a strong high end with 20 per cent R&D investment and a very strong low end of 50 per cent in commodity technology for which marketing and logistics will become essential  In the last quarter revenues at the ICM unit amounted to {XEU}2 7bn $2 4bn Heinrich von Pierer Siemens' chief executive said the group's divisions had to achieve a minimum margin of 8 per cent by 2004 With an operating profit of {XEU}13m in the last quarter of its financial year ICM edged into the black with an earnings margin before interest and taxes of 1 2 per cent Mr Lamprecht said ICM would have to lift its market share via increased production which will keep costs per item lower and thus raise margins Mr Lamprecht also dismissed recent rumours that the handset unit would form a joint venture with Motorola All the rumours are based on speculation There is nothing to disclose Partnerships are not always the solution to gain share ,2

2002-06-14, A promising start to the London trading session triggered by a strong close on Wall Street on Wednesday was wiped out by mid-morning yesterday as many of the banks and insurance stocks came under heavy fire By the close the market was looking extremely ragged not helped at all by Wall Street's response to US economic data released during the session which showed a shock 0 9 per cent fall in retail sales and a 0 4 per cent decline in producer prices in May  That news prompted an early three-figure slide in the Dow increasing the already severe pressure on London's main indices Adding to the downside pressures in London was the testimony by Sir Edward George and other members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee which included a warning from Sir Edward that the committee would have no option but to raise interest rates if domestic demand did not abate The testimony also made a reference to the unsustainability of the current trend in UK house prices The FTSE 100 eventually finished a net 79 8 lower at 4771 9 its lowest closing level since September 27 when the index was still recovering from the events of September 11 Suffering just as badly were the FTSE 250 which finished 52 9 off at 5857 9 after 5855 5 the FTSE SmallCap lost 13 3 to 2488 3 and the all-encompassing FTSE All-Share dropped 35 83 to 2334 43 Even worse a near-friendless Techmark 100 index lost another 13 92 to a record low of 911 87 The market's early gain saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average finish Wednesday's session with a three-figure gain having been under pressure earlier while the Nasdaq regained the 1500 level And the Federal Reserve's Beige Book which sets the agenda for the next meeting of the Fed's open market committee indicated that the US economic recovery was uneven That news was interpreted by markets as suggesting the FOMC would leave US interest rates on hold after its June 25/26 meeting The day's winners among the FTSE 100 constituents were mostly from the ultra-defensive areas including transport stocks such as British Airways and Hays while the tobacco stocks were again well represented Commenting on the latest slide in markets dealers and salesmen were bearish almost to a man It would be foolish in the extreme to take a big punt in this sort of market said one marketmaker Tony Jackson UK equity market strategist at ING Financial Markets said We think the market still has at least a couple of hundred points to fall It follows that we favour the defensive sectors for the time being while the decline continues And those are also for the most part the high-yielding sectors  Turnover in equities was 2 2bn shares ,2
2002-06-11, One of India's most keenly awaited initial public offerings closes today raising hopes of a revival in the primary issuance market IT products company I-Flex hopes to raise $40m-$45m from the sale of a 10 per cent stake in the Bombay-based company set up by Citibank a decade ago Bankers say investor response to the I-Flex issue will be a gauge of the appetite for a bulging pipeline of new and revived IPO issues totalling $800m to $1bn over the next 12 months The list includes big names coming to the market as part of the Indian government's sale of assets and they have generated more interest than usual in the IPO market Barely a handful of issuers tapped the market last year when financial scandals and the impact of a global melt-down of technology stocks frightened investors away Markets remain worried by the prospect of war between India and Pakistan despite yesterday's firming of equity prices Foreign investors for example were net sellers of Rs560m of Indian equities in May However bankers are optimistic that foreign interest could return because of the quality and volume of prospective IPO issuers In the coming months Maruti India's biggest vehicle maker National Aluminium Company and oil major Bharat Petroleum will be tapping the markets as the government reduces its stakes in these large often market-leading companies Tata Consultancy Services the largest software services company in India also plans an issue likely to be the biggest The line-up of blue chip names presents an appealing opportunity for investors at a time when the equity market is undervalued by 15 to 20 per cent say analysts Most new issues are also likely to be priced at a discount to sector benchmarks offering even more value to investors ,2
2002-06-21, Robertson Stephens used to be one of San Francisco's four horsemen The boutique investment bank together with Hambrecht & Quist Montgomery Securities and Alex Brown for decades dominated the West Coast market for technology-related initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions Now it is war in the form of the struggle against terrorism following September 11 a famine of new business and a plague of IT accounting scandals that have combined to create the threat of apocalypse for many of Silicon Valley's former leading investment banks It was not meant to be this way Just two years ago Robbie Stephens as the bank is known locally expected to post revenues up 50 per cent at a record $1 5bn a figure that Bob Emery the then chief executive expected to double within the following few years Instead revenues imploded caught by the sudden downdraft in tech-related M&A and equity issuance as well as a sharp fall in sales and trading activity The bank is now looking for its fourth owner in five years The latest indignity is that its current owner the disenchanted FleetBoston may actually give the bank away together with about $200m of liabilities to existing management That would be cheaper than closing down Robbie Stephens Fleet's decision to sell Robbie Stephens says much about the difficulty of commercial banks managing investment banking arms But the sale also underlines the dire imbalance between supply and demand in the West Coast investment banking industry There is tremendous over-capacity explains Thomas Weisel chief executive of Thomas Weisel Partners the San Francisco-based boutique investment bank In terms of supply the top national and international banks added a significant capacity during the late 1990s For example Deutsche Bank which acquired Alex Brown had 25 dedicated tech M&A bankers in 2000 a team that it believed could rival the market leaders Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and CSFB In fact at that time Goldman had 70-75 tech bankers in Silicon Valley But while supply increased demand for investment banking services collapsed At the peak in the second quarter of 2000 IPOs from companies based in California Washington state and Oregon generated $11 2bn During the first quarter this year they raised just $530m according to Thomson Financial As for M&A in the region the value of deals has collapsed more than 90 per cent from a peak of $149bn during the third quarter of 2000 to just $14bn last quarter There's an undignified scramble by firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs looking for every scrap of revenue says Mr Weisel With revenues down all banks have been retrenching aggressively Merrill Lynch ABN Amro ING and Societe Generale have all cut back heavily Other businesses are for sale It's no secret that US Bancorp has been trying to sell Piper Jaffray its investment banking wing says Mr Weisel There is a danger that Robbie Stephens' problems indicate a malaise that is less cyclical than structural Almost all elements of the investment banks' business are in trouble The nature of research following the unjustified promotion of many internet stocks during the bubble will have to be redefined A new business model for research will have to be adopted says David Golden managing director of global tech media and telecoms at JP Morgan Chase which bought H&Q Sales and trading operations which many banks expect to cover their costs are also struggling due to low volumes And the lack of IPOs and M&A has affected not only the investment banks' traditional fee business but also their private equity wings which many West Coast investment banks set up during the bubble Bankers are hoping for a recovery in the equity markets that may help sales and trading and boost IPO and M&A activity But the danger is that this level of activity is the new reality ,2
2002-06-26, Lion Biosciences the German biotechnology company took a step towards restoring its battered image yesterday when it announced a software deal with Pfizer the world's largest pharmaceuticals company The shares however gave up early gains after it revealed plans for further goodwill impairment charges Pfizer has licensed iDEA Lion's bio-informatics software for simulating the body's absorption of untested drug molecules The deal estimated by analysts to be worth up to {XEU}500m $485m to Lion could be followed by others Pfizer is evaluating a metabolism package which would allow its researchers to predict which drug candidates might have dangerous side effects Lion said it was also in talks with at least one other large pharmaceuticals group Analysts said the agreement with Pfizer which closely follows two other research deals was of marginal financial impact but marked a turning point for Lion They have got a high growth business that is very close to profit said Robin Campbell of WestLB Panmure Lion faced a tough challenge in winning back investor support This is a nice step towards rehabilitation he said Lion shares leapt as high as {XEU}123 50 after it floated in August 2000 They slumped to {XEU}4 10 earlier this month after the company surprised investors with larger-than-expected asset write-offs and plans to spin off its drug discovery activities Yesterday Lion said it could take a further {XEU}60m charge linked to the acquisitions of Trega Biosciences which developed the iDEA software and NetGenetics Most platform technology companies are diverting resources into drug discovery which offers potentially greater financial rewards But Lion insists its future lies in the $3 5bn bio-informatics market ,2
2002-06-14, Consignia yesterday warned of more heavy losses to come as it announced the worst results in the postal operator's history and confirmed plans to cut 17000 jobs from its Royal Mail division But Allan Leighton Consignia's chairman who yesterday confirmed he would be staying on for another two to three years said he was confident he could restore profitability within three years as he revealed losses of £1 1bn for the year This business has been looking at this for two or three years said Mr Leighton as he warned that unless we change we will die The group confirmed the jobs cut plan and the replacement of the Consignia name with Royal Mail Group plc by the end of the year Earlier this year it cut 13000 jobs at its Parcelforce division and announced moves to close up to 3000 unprofitable urban sub-post offices as part of its £1 4bn cost-cutting plan Mr Leighton said yesterday that a further two to three thousand managerial jobs could go across the company Consignia warned that it was far from being out of financial trouble with a similar level of losses expected next year and a £500m exceptional charge on yesterday's job cuts likely in its next interim results Mr Leighton said he was set to give up two or three of his nine directorships outside of Consignia and to spend more time at the company where he currently spends two days a week Consignia is to begin the hunt for a new chief executive after John Roberts chief executive for the last seven years confirmed expectations that he would retire at the end of the year He has taken some of the blame for the company's parlous losses Consignia is also looking for two non-executive directors The group reported an operating loss for the year of £318m against a restated figure of £206m last time with all three of its divisions losing money The rest of the £1 1bn losses came from exceptional costs on restructuring the business However Mr Leighton said he was optimistic that the company which will save £350m a year by dropping the second post delivery would return to profitability within three years The other components of the £1 4bn cost-cutting plan include operational improvements at Royal Mail a restructuring of Parcelforce a streamlining of the company's transport network more outsourcing and cutting management costs at the Post Office network Mr Leighton challenged the postal regulator to allow Consignia to profit from rival operators using delivery network and postmen when competition is introduced in January We are not prepared to open the network at loss he said Postal unions gave a restrained response to the results which had been widely leaked Billy Hayes general secretary of the Communication Workers Union said the union would work with the company to improve productivity But he said that the union would insist any and every job cut is justified and would not hit the service or employees Patricia Hewitt trade and industry secretary said if the company's profitability targets were not met the government would consider making further changes to the board Opposition parties accused the government of trying to pass the buck over the financial fiasco The ultimate responsibility must rest with your government which was the main shareholder and interfered on a daily basis John Whittingdale shadow trade and industry secretary told the Commons He said Ms Hewitt's statement included no acceptance of blame whatsoever for the disastrous collapse in the service's finances But Ms Hewitt replied to Tory jeers that the important thing is not finger pointing name calling trying to allocate blame It is to support the company in these very difficult decisions ,2
2002-06-01, Fund managers and regulators are in turn excited and alarmed by the sheer numbers of hedge funds being sold to private investors New investments in hedge funds have more than doubled in five years and assets grew by 20 per cent last year according to hedge fund analysts Tremont Advisers The popularity of these largely unregulated investments is forcing regulators to re-examine them The Financial Services Authority the chief City regulator has barred most hedge funds from being marketed and sold to UK retail investors The FSA has repeatedly warned private investors to beware of what it calls exotic Isas hedge funds that have been wrapped and sold as a tax-free individual savings account to private investors But the regulator could shift its position in a discussion paper this summer One of its proposals is to set up a class of funds that could be regulated and marketed directly to retail investors The FSA's move is partly prompted by the surge in demand for this type of investment Barclays Global Investors this week announced that it has taken in so much new money into its leveraged UK Equity Market Neutral II fund launched in March this year that it has closed it to new investors The flood of new money has already prompted Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission to allow retail investors the chance to buy hedge funds later in the year The idea as much as anything is that broadening Hong Kong's range of investment offerings will boost the region's position in Asia The attraction for investors is that hedge funds can make money even when stock markets fall or so the managers claim The marketing spiel goes like this hedge funds benefit by being run by the most talented managers keen to operate outside the constraints imposed by conventional onshore fund management companies Hedge fund managers are able to pay out positive returns with low bond-like volatility regardless of what stock markets are doing Short-term figures back these claims According to CSFB/Tremont's index of hedge fund performance figures during April when the big US market indices fell eight out of 10 hedge fund sectors posted gains The S&P 500 fell 6 per cent and the Nasdaq tumbled 8 5 per cent during the month while hedge funds rose overall by 1 per cent in value However regulators and analysts are increasingly concerned that longer-term results could disappoint investors who have been led to expect double-digit returns from these funds in spite of markets' expectations of low inflation and low returns Managers can't turn in much higher returns without taking high risks they say Analysts argue that returns will be squeezed by the crowd of new entrants chasing the same opportunities in niche markets At the same time there has been a slump in many of these areas such as corporate merger-and-acquisition activity Research by McFall Lamm chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank's private bank in New York indicates that the differential between the top quartile and the bottom appears to be near 20 per cent This gap could widen says Mr Lamm as more funds flow in from inexperienced investors many of them going to less experienced managers Allenbridge a group of advisers is now forecasting returns of 3 to 5 per cent for all hedge fund strategies for the full year At the same time the dangers are becoming more apparent Andrew Popper head of portfolio management at SG Hambros Bank points out that investing in individual hedge funds is accompanied by increased risks with regard to safety liquidity and transparency He worries that returns have not been fully tested Equities have a 100-year record but investors have little idea how hedge fund returns will be affected in extreme and unpredictable markets Meanwhile research from a team of academics at Reading University warns that the statistics on hedge funds may mislead investors into overestimating the benefits and underestimating the risks Harry Kat associate professor of finance says When things go wrong in the stock market they also tend to go wrong for hedge funds  He and other academics argue that lack of transparency and limited trading in some markets make the hedge funds investing in them look much less volatile than they are In reality swings in returns are more extreme and often more negative than supposed says Prof Kat In addition hedge fund indices show a distinct bias towards what the industry calls survivorship Various hedge fund indices overstate returns by excluding the worst performing funds that go bust and disappear from the index Only 60 per cent of hedge funds that were in business five years ago are still with us Most advisers reckon that the best option for private investors is to buy a fund of funds as the optimum way of spreading exposure among different strategies and managers However critics point out that funds of funds double up the already high charges on individual funds to beat these charges funds of funds have to take higher risks Worse over 1994-2001 the average fund of funds did almost 3 per cent a year worse than a random portfolio of hedge funds says Prof Kat There is little evidence that managers of funds of funds can consistently select future outperformers Moreover many of the best funds are now closed to new investors Analysts say that adding hedge funds to a portfolio may enhance returns or reduce risk but they can rarely do both Funds that are genuinely low-risk may end up giving away performance when markets are rising while funds that promise high returns may be taking more risks than anyone

2002-06-26, Human resources consultants talk a lot about looking beyond cost cutting when it comes to outsourcing companies' HR functions Jim Madden CEO of Exult the California-based specialist outsourcing company takes a more realistic view I don't believe any company will sign up for this without cost reduction being part of it he says But he stresses that the reason his clients use Exult among them are BP Bank of America and since January Prudential Financial of the US is not just about saving money Most companies don't want to put their own resources into the HR department he says It's not a high priority for them If we can provide a guaranteed better level of service it's one less thing for them to worry about  Exult runs what Mr Madden describes as the engine room of his clients This encompasses processes ranging from training and administration of payroll and benefits to installing and running software Exult's clients are usually companies with more than 25000 employees Its average client has about 60000 employees and the largest Bank of America has about 160000 employees Between them the company's teams have managed more than $10bn in outsourcing contracts Things got off to a good start when in December 1999 just a year after Exult was established by General Atlantic Partners the private equity firm the company signed a seven-year $600m HR outsourcing contract agreement with BP At the time the deal was the largest of its kind in history Recent contracts include the $700m agreement with Prudential Financial and a 10-year $600m agreement with International Paper signed last October These and other companies expect a seamless service most of which will not be apparent to clients' employees If a company has a sophisticated web portal of its own as was the case with BP Exult will leave it alone If they've got a nice window in place and employees are comfortable with it that's fine says Mr Madden We'll hook up everything else underneath that to make it invisible to the employee  This invisibility is achieved through a combination of three delivery mechanisms  Intranet technology Exult's online portal is called myHR through which clients' employees access the system  Centres in locations such as Houston Charlotte and Glasgow act as sophisticated call centres answering calls as whichever company the employee is calling from  Transaction processes such as the administration of payroll and benefits and soon finance and accounting outsourcing as part of broader outsourcing contracts While it manages about $15bn per year in payroll transactions it now also manages about $12bn a year in accounts payable transactions An attractive client for us is one going through a lot of change because it creates an opportunity they're probably going to want to focus on the integration of front office processes like customer service or manufacturing says Mr Madden Some clients have approached us because they view it as one way to make an integration of a merger go that much more quickly he adds Or maybe they've just completed an integration and they've got too much work on their plates  Areas Exult steers clear of include succession planning or the promotion or recruiting of senior executives It also avoids compliance or fiduciary responsibilities such as pension plans But for all other HR business processes Mr Madden believes outsourcing is the answer Some companies don't want to outsource because they feel they're losing control of a process he says Our response would be that actually you gain lot of control because if we don't perform and we miss a service level we are contractually on the hook to not only make it right but also write a cheque for a service penalty If they keep those processes internally who's going to write that cheque Sarah Murray,1
2002-06-29, As equity markets have continued to slide the danger that more life assurers might be forced to sell equities in order to meet the regulator's solvency requirements has loomed larger The UK's Financial Services Authority has now adjusted the resilience tests applied to life assurers' investment portfolios in a way that significantly reduces the prospect of solvency-driven equity sales The adjustment is carefully pitched as an addition to the rules not a suspension of them the option the FSA took last September in the volatile market conditions that followed the terrorist attacks on the US The immediate effect however is still to make the stress test considerably less stressful The old rules required insurers to test how their portfolios would stand up to a 25 per cent drop in equity prices At current levels that means testing against the FTSE 100 index falling to 3405 The new rules which measure against the average level of the last three months set the benchmark at 3805 though if the market were to remain at this level the gap would unwind progressively In its detail the new test appears sensible It tapers the effect of sharp market movements and should give insurers more leeway to adapt their portfolios and capital bases smoothly to new market conditions But the timing coming after the FTSE has fallen 9 per cent in a month still raises concerns Most of the larger life assurers appear at current market levels to be in no imminent danger of being cornered into forced equity sales But the FSA's move could reignite concerns that without the benefit of this adjustment some were getting close to the borderline Whatever the merits of the new rules it would have been better to have introduced them at a less stressful moment ,2

1998-04-01, Robert Palmer Digital Equipment chief executive has indicated that he is unlikely to remain with the computer group after the proposed merger with Compaq Computer is completed Mr Palmer who joined Digital in 1985 said he had yet to discuss his future with Eckhard Pfeiffer Compaq chief executive Certainly after the merger is approved I have said we should sit down to discuss the issue he said You do not need two chief executive officers and I certainly would not accept a 'make-work' role  There has been growing speculation about what Mr Palmer who became chief executive in 1992 might do after the merger which will create a powerful third force in the full-service enterprise computing market alongside IBM and Hewlett-Packard Analysts have suggested that Mr Palmer an industry veteran and accomplished semiconductor engineer who co-founded Mostek in 1969 might retire after the merger The deal is subject to shareholder and Federal Trade Commission approval but is expected to be completed by June However Mr Palmer suggested he had other ambitions I am still relatively young he said He said it was too early to speculate about redundancies among Digital's 54000 workforce and that detailed plans would be made public when the two companies filed their proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission expected in the next few weeks He said there was relatively little overlap between the two companies' products although he accepted there would have to be a rationalisation of some operations particularly the engineering sales and services operations Customers do not want three salesmen one each from Compaq Tandem and Digital in the lobby he said Other senior Digital executives acknowledged that there would also be job losses among head office staff Compaq has demonstrated greater manufacturing efficiency and higher sales per employee while Digital is known for its architecture and engineering excellence Mr Palmer said He has said the merged company would be headquartered in Houston and that it would carry the Compaq name However he expressed confidence that Digital's core technologies would survive and noted that Mr Pfeiffer has publicly stated his commitment to Digital's Alpha microprocessor technology and its 64-bit Unix and Open VMS operating systems He said he expected Alpha to continue to provide a high performance platform for the merged group's customers Mr Palmer said he remained very optimistic about the acquisition by Compaq although he acknowledged that few mergers in the high-tech industry succeed Very few combinations make as much sense as this one he said ,1

2002-06-01, Japan yesterday suffered a rare and humiliating two-notch downgrade to its sovereign debt rating by Moody's Investors Service the credit rating agency which now ranks the world's second largest economy at the same level as Poland and Latvia The move infuriated the government by focusing attention away from the tentative signs of economic recovery and putting the spotlight on Japan's deteriorating fiscal position Washington also resumed its criticism of Japanese economic policy Glenn Hubbard the White House economic adviser urged Tokyo to make changes in its fiscal policy to encourage lasting growth The outlook is that there are needed changes to be made in fiscal policy in Japan and the sustainability of the economic performance of the country he said Japanese authorities again waded into foreign exchange markets yesterday to curb the yen whose strength they fear could imperil the economic revival Official dollar purchases an estimated $4bn-$5bn £2 7bn-£3 4bn sent the US currency up from Y123 to Y124 4 Analysts said the Japanese authorities were likely to intervene again early next week in an effort to push the dollar back above Y125 The nascent economic recovery has been driven by an increase in exports to the US the yen's recent move to just over Y123 to the dollar has threatened to end the recovery before it had a chance to begin properly The Ministry of Finance which has taken the unusual decision of picking a public fight with the world's three leading rating agencies Moody's Standard & Poor's and Fitch yesterday described the move as completely inappropriate The government has argued that Japan's position as the world's largest creditor with the largest savings surplus the biggest current account surplus and largest foreign exchange reserves makes the demotion of its rating to a level below that of Botswana ridiculous Moody's downgraded its local currency debt rating to A2 from Aa3 with a stable outlook and maintained its foreign currency rating at Aa1 with a stable outlook Japan's local currency guideline the upper limit for issuers domiciled in Japan was unchanged at Aaa Moody's yesterday in effect accepted some of the arguments put forward by the MoF by saying the essentially closed nature of the Japanese financial system provides a high level of financial stability such that the risk of an uncontrolled funding crisis is remote A new Japan Page 10 www ft com/asiapacific,2
2002-06-01, Carphone Warehouse Europe's largest mobile phone retailer will next week reveal that more than 1000 rival UK outlets have closed this year The company will report its financial results for the year to March 30 on Thursday following the publication of disappointing figures by network operators Vodafone and MMO{2} this week The store closures are expected to bolster Carphone's UK market share The company has not closed any of its own UK outlets this year but will reveal that the total number of mobile phone retail outlets in the UK has fallen from about 4700 in December to 3500 in March The mobile phone market continues to suffer the effects of slowing handset sales reflecting both saturation levels for second generation mobile phones and delays to the arrival of next generation handsets Other retailers have also been hit by declining demand for pre-pay handsets following the withdrawal of operators' subsidies Carphone's penchant for advice has helped it focus on contract customers In a trading statement in March Carphone said pre-tax profits before goodwill and exceptionals would be £45m-£50m Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation are expected to have increased from £66m to more than £70m despite slowing demand reflecting an improved share of the market However Carphone has earlier indicated it will incur a one-off £32m restructuring charge largely for store closures in Germany and Belgium It's a big exceptional but will give them a clean start said Nathan Cockrell an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Carphone's joint broker It is compensated for by the sale and leaseback on its head office  The results will mark the debut of Hans Snook Carphone's recently-appointed chairman who is widely credited with turning Orange into one of Europe's leading mobile phone operators as its founding chief executive Carphone has been refashioning itself as a broader telecommunications group rather than just a retailer and nearly half its profits are expected to have been generated by after-sales services with recurring revenues ,2

2002-06-19, Markets grossly overvalued says US treasury secretary That is not a headline one expects to read Treasury secretaries are cheerleaders So Paul O'Neill may have believed he was doing his job this weekend by expressing the view that recent falls in share prices were inexplicable But the remark was a howler Mr O'Neill implicitly excluded the possibility that the valuations from which recent falls occurred were still far too high Yet the evidence suggests that the surprising fact is not that markets have fallen but that they remain so overvalued The story is told in my chart This shows the Standard & Poor's composite index deflated by consumer prices since the 1880s On this logarithmic scale the steeper the slope the faster the rate of growth There have been several bull markets the fastest rise was in the 1920s but the longest and cumulatively biggest was in the 1980s and 1990s A line across each successive peak up to and including 1968 rises at a compound rate of just under 1{1/2} per cent a year It can also take decades to regain a previous peak Above all in the mid-1990s the market shot far above the peak-to-peak trend At its highest it was almost twice as high Even today the peak-to-peak trend suggests a value on the S&P 500 of below 900 The implication is that the market's level remains historically abnormal Can this be justified To answer this question one has to consider fundamental value There exist three analytically serious methods for valuing markets all of which are properly applied and measured equivalent Tobin's Q or the valuation ratio which relates the market's value to the replacement cost of net corporate assets the cyclically adjusted ratio of stock market prices to earnings and the dividend discount model which compares the real return to shareholders measured as the current payout plus its likely real rate of growth to the equilibrium risk-free real interest rate plus the equity risk premium The often-used relationship between nominal interest rates and equity yields is in comparison with these methods a joke as I have argued in a previous column A poor defence for share prices October 24 2001 It conflates changes in real interest rates which are relevant with changes in inflation which may not be So what do the three measures of fundamental value appear to tell us about US markets The answer on the first two is straightforward As Andrew Smithers and Stephen Wright of London-based Smithers & Co show in a paper published in May both Q and cyclically adjusted p/e ratios suggest that the market was then around 1 8 times overvalued It had moved from being the most highly valued market in history to being only a little less highly valued than at the 1929 peak What about the dividend discount model The dividend yield on the S&P 500 is currently 1 5 per cent But share buy-backs must also be taken into account An analysis by two economists at the Federal Reserve shows that the net repurchase rate was about 1 per cent in the second half of the 1990s  But they forecast a sustainable level of half a per cent This gives a total equity yield of 2 per cent equivalent to a payout ratio of about 50 per cent Evidence suggests that corporate profits grow no faster than gross domestic product in the long run The 1990s profits surge ended in 1997 whereupon the miracle economy turned out to be dismal for profits This was painfully true for the high technology sectors A reasonable guess is that the long-term growth of the economy will be 3-3{1/2} per cent That gives a total real return on equities of 5-5{1/2} per cent Take one percentage point off for management fees and costs of transactions and the real return falls to 4-4{1/2} per cent Meanwhile the real interest rate on risk-free bonds is 3 per cent the rate on US index-linked treasury securities The prospective equity premium is then around 1-1{1/2} per cent Yet in a superb analysis of the stock markets of the advanced economies Triumph of the Optimists 101 Years of Global Investment Returns Elroy Dimson Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School estimate the prospective worldwide equity premium over riskless bonds at 4 per cent on an arithmetic mean  To deliver the required real return of 7 per cent the yield on the market needs to be 3{1/2} to 4 per cent Again that suggests the market is seriously overvalued It is possible to question the assumptions in this calculation The economy and profits may grow faster particularly during a recovery But the most obvious way of challenging the model is to question the risk premium Here at least three points must be made First equities are indeed risky As the London Business School authors argue common stocks cannot be regarded as a safe bet for the long haul even when the investment horizon has a duration of 20 or more years The shortest period that one needs to hold equities and be confident of a strong outperformance over bonds has been not far short of 40 years The worst years to buy stocks were not surprisingly when they were highly valued Second since the cost of capital must in equilibrium equal its return a decline in the risk premium would lower the cost of capital to companies only if the supply of capital increased Otherwise the risk-free rate would itself rise The decline in the risk premium would raise the cost of capital to governments not lower it to companies Third nobody is behaving as if the expected real return on and cost of capital is far lower than ever before If this were true surveys would suggest lower expected returns from markets than before the opposite is the case In addition companies would sustain investment as returns fell the recent investment bust suggests just the opposite Either this has been a bubble the scale of which is making deflation slow and painful or the long-run real return on and cost of capital in the US is lower than before If it is the former markets remain very expensive If it is the latter everyone expects historically low returns I for one think the market is simply expensive  Nellie Liang and Steven Sharpe Share

2002-04-30, The shock result of France's first-round presidential election has sent three clear messages to the country's leaders First things cannot go on as they are France's decline must be halted Second France must be governed properly politics must again become the exercise of power translated into action not the privilege of occupying office disguised by hollow communication Third the present leadership an ageing and corrupt clique mummified in the privileges of an oligarchy of technocrats must give way to a new generation more diverse in its origins and experiences more open to society and the world more committed to tackling the country's problems and more ethically exacting Faced with these demands there are two possible responses The first is to ignore them to dismiss the result as an aberration and to return as quickly as possible to the familiar divisions of partisan politics For the right this means exploiting to the full Lionel Jospin's absence from Sunday's decisive second-round vote For the left it means taking to the streets to rebuild the broad left majority before the forthcoming parliamentary elections The second response is to draw on the result both as a rejection of the political system its actors and the experience of cohabitation and as aradical expression of desire for change For Jacques Chirac this second approach implies an electoral strategy in which he becomes defender of the nation above party politics a leader who can at last set in train a programme of renewal that breaks with the past The goal would be a root-and-branch overhaul of the constitution scrapping cohabitation a fully independent judiciary decentralisation and a separation of roles so that no one can hold several offices at the same time It also requires a rapid start on long-deferred reforms of tax employment law education health pensions and the rest Yet faced with these alternatives Mr Chirac has chosen not to choose His campaign alternates between lofty appeals to the values of the Republic and crude messages focused on the theme of law and order his substitute for a political programme since the first round As a result it is as if Mr Chirac regards April 21 merely as a mild outbreak of fever that will respond to gentle medicine or even as an unhoped-for chance for re-election that can be turned to his advantage This approach is full of dangers both to his legitimacy as president and for the country as a whole whose decline and endemic instability it will accelerate Jean-Marie Le Pen must be weakened at the ballot box rather than in the street He should be challenged in debate not shunned criticised for his unreasonable and perverse manifesto rather than personally vilified Mr Chirac's refusal to take part in a televised confrontation with his far-right rival is therefore a mistake He has lost an opportunity to demonstrate one of his few consistent principles his revulsion for the National Front He has reduced his future legitimacy even further given that the 44 per cent of votes cast for the left in the first round are deprived of proper expression in the second round and the 20 per cent of votes for the far right are placed beyond public debate And all the while he reinforces Mr Le Pen's claim to be a victim of a political elite that distrusts the people The hasty creation this week of a coalition to give Mr Chirac a centre-right majority in the parliamentary elections seems ill-advised It blocks the mobilisation of the traditional right against Mr Le Pen which should remain the absolute priority It may complicate rather than simplify the reconstruction of the right That in turn may feed the left's desire to seek revenge for Mr Jospin's defeat increasing the prospect of a further spell of debilitating cohabitation between president and prime minister It could lead to an un-Governable parliament at the mercy of a group of National Front deputies and fellow travellers The election of a government unable to pursue decisive reforms would have devastating consequences for France The absence of any clear indication of the team that would lead the country and the goals it would pursue plays into the hands of Mr Le Pen whose programme is if nothing else clearly defined There can be no doubt that an elected president with weak legitimacy and an uncertain mandate would soon stymie the process of reform if it was not made impossible from the outset Politicians can manage interests regulate power manipulate sentiment but they cannot ignore the fury of a humiliated people especially when those people are willing to turn violent against each other France is calling for a war leader to wage a drastic campaign against decline If the voters feel they are been tricked again by the same political posturing it could all end very badly Defeat this time for all parties might even be irreversible The writer is a French historian and economist,3

2002-06-26, Martha Stewart the US lifestyle icon went on network television yesterday to deny any wrongdoing in selling shares in ImClone the day before negative news on a drug sent the biotechnology group's shares tumbling Interviewed during a regular cookery slot on CBS's The Early Show Ms Stewart said she believed the affair would be resolved soon and she would be absolved of any ridiculousness While chopping cabbage for a summer salad Ms Stewart said the sensitivity of the investigations into the affair meant she was not at liberty to answer many other questions She declined to comment on last Friday's suspension of Peter Bacanovic her stockbroker by Merrill Lynch and his assistant Douglas Faneuil Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Ms Stewart's company fell 21 per cent to an all-time low on Monday as investors worried that negative publicity around its eponymous founder could damage the brand The shares regained some ground yesterday morning rising 48 cents or 3 8 per cent to $13 03 by lunchtime Ms Stewart has previously said she sold her 3928 remaining shares in ImClone on December 27 as a result of an agreement with her broker to sell if the price fell below $60 But Merrill is understood in interviews with Mr Bacanovic and Mr Faneuil to have uncovered discrepancies that raised questions over whether there was such a price target It remained unclear exactly what triggered the sale however The House energy and commerce committee investigating ImClone has asked for copies of Mr Bacanovic's telephone records and client list The committee is also examining trading logs concerning his other clients It hoped to interview the Merrill broker on Thursday or Friday this week but it remained unclear yesterday whether he would appear ,2
2002-04-20, One of the legacies of the French Revolution is a public fascination with seeing the heads of the rich and powerful roll Two hundred years ago the Paris crowds flocked to see regal and aristocratic heads fall under the guillotine in the Place de la Concorde This week a short walk away outraged employees stood outside the headquarters of Vivendi Universal the media conglomerate calling for the blood of Jean-Marie Messier The crime of Mr Messier chairman of the company has been close to treason not just in the eyes of employees but of the entire political establishment He is accused of betraying l'exception francaise the idea that France has a unique cultural identity that must be defended at all costs against Hollywood More directly he is charged with engineering in the pursuit of profit a palace coup at loss-making Canal Plus the pay-television company owned by Vivendi By sacking Pierre Lescure chairman of Canal Plus Mr Messier is seen to have damaged a key force in maintaining the independence of the country's film industry Under French law Canal Plus must contribute to national film production Regardless of whether Mr Messier has got too big for his boots lost his roots and misplayed his hand the antipathy he has aroused is emblematic of France's fear of change in a world dominated by the US Indeed the Messier saga has generated such passions this week that on occasions it has pushed from the headlines what should have been the main event the run-up to the first round of the presidential elections on Sunday As such it has had the merit of focusing attention on how France confronts globalisation and its shrinking role on the world stage Until this happened such issues had been touched on at best gingerly during the election campaign by the two main candidates on the right and left outgoing President Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin Mr Chirac talks in vague terms of the virtues of a more liberal economy while simultaneously pledging to defend French interests Mr Jospin wants tougher rules to protect the French public service culture but knows he has to make concessions Eleven of the other 14 presidential hopefuls whether on the right or left are opposed to globalisation and anti-capitalist in tone So sensitive is the subject electorally that a brief jail sentence imposed on Jose Bove the publicity-conscious figurehead of the anti-globalisation movement in France has been delayed for fear of upsetting the election campaign Mr Bove was sentenced for his role in destroying a McDonald's fast food restaurant Whoever wins the second round of the presidential vote on May 5 will have to confront the changes in French society illustrated by l'affaire Messier  Mr Messier was once seen to have political ambitions Yet like several talented forty-somethings he has eschewed the traditional career structure of the French elite Instead of shifting effortlessly from the civil service into politics they have sought well-paid jobs in business This phenomenon has contributed to the lack of renewal in the French political class and it is part of a more general national disaffection with politics Such indifference has grown despite evidence that France is at a political turning point This election could signal the end of the political model enshrined in the founding of the Fifth Republic under Charles de Gaulle in 1958 This was a France shaped round a strong presidency and a weak national assembly By creating a directly-elected head of state Gen de Gaulle established a republican monarchy with a renewable seven-year term of office This presidential system unique in Europe in terms of its lack of checks and balances was tailor-made for the general himself It failed to take account of the fact that parliamentary elections might return a majority opposed to the president's policies Since 1986 there have been three such cohabitations including that of Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin The latest co-habitation has reduced President Chirac to a benign figurehead with residual control over France's role abroad The old left-right policy divide has blurred helping to lull the country into political torpor But there are vital issues at stake in the election If the polls are correct in predicting a tight Chirac- Jospin race in the second-round contest it will place more emphasis on the parliamentary elections in June Until now presidential and parliamentary elections have not coincided That means that voters are getting their first chance to vote tactically on co-habitation The June election will give the electorate the choice of whether to re-establish a presidency with full powers If it chooses not to the resulting cohabitation would bury the concept of a republican monarchy forever and push France towards a more parliamentary system like the rest of Europe making the presidency increasingly honorific Even if the next president wins control of parliament the Jospin administration has changed the ground rules by cutting the presidential term to five years from seven This will inevitably make the head of state more accountable to the electorate and allow the French presidency to be less of an exception among major democracies For now the people are enthralled by the spectacle of Jean-Marie Messier but soon they will have the chance to reshape France ,3
2002-06-08, Marks and Spencer yesterday said it would seek investor approval for a new bonus scheme which could result in awards to directors and senior executives increasing by as much as 250 per cent The plan aimed at providing substantial incentives for six board members and 24 senior executives would make it compulsory for recipients to invest one third of any cash bonus in M&S shares The cash bonus could amount to as much as 100 per cent of the executive's salary Executives could invest the entire amount of their bonus in the share scheme if they so wished The news emerged as M&S published its annual report revealing that Luc Vandevelde chairman and chief executive received a total pay package of £2 23m in the year to March 30 2002 an increase from £834000 last time The pay-out included bonuses of £1 36m £704000 of which was deferred from the previous year and a salary of £654000 Assuming Mr Vandevelde earned a bonus equal to his base salary last year he could be in line for a £1 64m pay-out after three years if he invested the entire amount in shares Roger Holmes managing director of UK retail would earn just over £1m on the same basis Potential rewards through the Executive Share Matching Plan are linked to three-year performance targets These are based on M&S's total shareholder returns compared to two peer groups a basket of 20 retailers made up of the largest food and clothing retailers and the FTSE 100 Each would have a 50/50 weighting But at the upper end of the range which would mean M&S would have to perform in line with the top ten FTSE 100 and top two retailers the return could be 2 5 times the executives' original investment in shares If M&S performs badly against the peer group the payout would be capped at a minimum of their original investment plus 25 per cent M&S said it had already been in talks with its largest shareholders about the scheme It claimed it wanted to align the performance of the share bonus scheme with the share price performance It said executives would have five years to invest the equivalent of 100 per cent of their base salary in M&S shares From next year one-third of the bonus will be compulsorily invested in shares though executives can invest all of their bonus in shares The shares fell 2p to 370p ,2
2002-04-06, The US Defense Depart-ment's effort to broaden the scope of national security reviews for foreign acquisitions of American companies is only the latest in a decade long campaign Leading conservatives in the Republican party have long looked to tighten export controls to prevent sensitive technologies from slipping into the hands of suspect governments Indeed the first battles over foreign ownership of US defence contractors occurred during the Reagan and first Bush administrations which implemented the Exon-Florio law that placed mergers involving overseas buyers under the purview of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US CFIUS a secretive agency chaired by the Treasury Department However the late 1980s was a different policy era with fears rampant among national security hawks that foreign industry particularly in Japan was overtaking American companies and would ultimately force the US to rely on overseas companies for key defence technologies Although it was a different era many of today's players were there particularly Richard Perle then a mid-level Defense Department official who is now seen as the intellectual godfather of many top Pentagon policymakers including Paul Wolfowitz deputy defence secretary and Douglas Feith head of defence policy Both opponents and advocates of the Pentagon's current push the department has drafted legislation that would mandate CFIUS review for all foreign acquisitions valued at more than $100m agree that the same defence hawks pushing for US intervention in Iraq and for a national missile defence system are behind the new legislation This is Richard Perle setting merger policy said one critic of the move While the players in the debate may not have changed the political arena has shifted significantly Efforts in the 1980s to tighten foreign access to US markets was largely a bipartisan affair with defence hawks on the Republican right finding common cause with economic protectionists on the Democratic left But this is no longer the case The current battles stem largely from criticism of the Clinton administration which was repeatedly accused of a lax policy towards export licence waivers particularly to China Expectations were high among defence hawks that George W Bush's administration would bring a large-scale change in policy towards foreign defence acquisitions The first sign of this was last year's efforts by the Pentagon led by Mr Wolfowitz to block the Dutch group ASM Lithography's $1 2bn buyout of California technology company Silicon Valley Group a maker of high-calibre optics and high-speed computer chips This was a fundamental policy shift said Todd Malan executive director of the Organisation for International Investment a group that represents foreign companies with US subsidiaries The people that are advocating this position know nothing about cross-border merger policy They are unaware of the consequences of time and costs for these companies and they really don't care  But despite the Pentagon intervening through CFIUS in the Dutch deal many conservatives remain disappointed that the Bush administration has been reluctant to be more aggressive in implementing new policies to protect sensitive US technologies They accuse the White House of some of the same sins as the Clinton administration bowing to economic interests and campaign contributors at the expense of national defence There was some expectation that the Bush administration would be much more sensitive to the concerns of the defence hawks said Alan Tonelson a research fellow at the conservative US Business and Industry Council I am concerned that the political will to do the kind of monitoring needed in these proposed transactions does not exist at the top of this administration ,1
2002-06-14, With the Israeli shekel at a record low investors on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange have been desperately seeking reassurance from the captains of the economy over fiscal and monetary policy David Klein the central bank governor knew this on Sunday when he lifted the key interest rate by 1 5 percentage points the second rise in two weeks in an extraordinary move designed to keep the shekel from falling beyond the psychological barrier of Shk5 per dollar Later in the week he met Silvan Shalom the finance minister to try to end an ongoing policy row that has undermined their credibility And last night the two were expected to meet Ariel Sharon the prime minister in another confidence-building gesture to the marketplace But so far the market has found no comfort The interest rate move may have stopped the shekel from falling below Shk5 per US dollar but it has not reversed the trend Meanwhile still shaken by the shekel the TA 100 index slipped another 0 05 to 362 09 yesterday after gradually sliding downwards throughout the week in lacklustre trading Talking is not enough and we need to see action such as another major cut in the budget or another interest rate rise said Stephen Levey head of UBS Warburg's Tel Aviv office Nobody believes there is any stability  The market has also been confused by the implications of tax reform proposals unveiled this week If implemented the programme would impose a capital gains tax on stock market earnings to finance a gradual decline in income taxes But the problem stems from last December when the Bank of Israel slashed interest rates by 2 percentage points to 3 8 per cent a historic low Initial excitement and hopes of a rebound in growth dissipated quickly as the rate cut sent the shekel on a sharp decline more than 17 per cent over six months and triggered an inflationary surge At the same time with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict raging on and the global economy still shaky growth is expected to be flat this year after a 0 6 per cent contraction in 2001 And fiscal policy is a mess despite a recent Shk13bn austerity plan to plug a gaping hole in the country's budget After widening the deficit target from 3 to 3 9 per cent of gross domestic product economists still believe the deficit is heading for at least 5 per cent and further cuts will be necessary The dilemma now is whether to move hard and fast to stabilise financial markets knowing that a tighter monetary policy and more budget cuts will further stifle growth If that happens the shekel may stabilise but as long as there isn't a political endgame regarding the security situation concerns over the budget deficit and inflation targets will probably persist said Mehmet Simsek emerging market economist at Merrill Lynch in London None of these scenarios is good for investors While they want to see the shekel stabilise they know that squeezing growth will further darken corporate earnings and further depress an already unhappy mood surrounding Israeli equities Avi Machlis,3

2002-04-18, People on a salary of £100000 a year will pay almost £1000 more in tax thanks to the chancellor's decision to increase national insurance contributions by 1 per cent across the board Matt Barrett chief executive of Barclays would have paid an extra £18620 on his 2001 income of £1 86m which includes a salary of £850000 an annual cash bonus of £765000 and benefits of £247000 But accountants said some high earners would be relieved that Gordon Brown did not completely remove the upper limit on national insurance contributions For Mr Barrett that would have added more than £95000 to his tax bill last year The decision to add an extra penny in NI contributions across the board from 10 to 11 per cent means that rather than fund improvements to the National Health Service mainly out of the incomes of the best-paid segment of the UK population the money will come almost equally from all income groups including lower and middle-earners Simon Philip a partner at Andersen Private Client Services said This is clever politics There will be many people relieved that it is only 1 per cent  He said middle and higher earners had been braced for a much larger proportion of their disposable income being taken away The chancellor has raised NI contributions from April 2003 on all earnings above £89 a week or £4615 a year from 10 per cent to 11 per cent across the board The extra amount means taxpayers will pay 11 per cent up to the earnings cap of £30420 effectively increasing tax across the board by a penny This adds an extra £261 52 a year for taxpayers up to that limit However taxpayers in the 40 per cent tax bracket whose NI contributions would previously have been pegged at the £30420 limit will now be paying an extra penny in tax up to their maximum earnings In effect a person earning £50000 a year will pay that extra penny on their earnings about £456 a year more For some of the UK's higher earners the one penny increase means they will be required to find thousands of pounds more Jonathan Bloomer chief executive of Prudential the life assurer whose salary in 2001 was £958000 not including benefits would have to pay an extra £9537 32 in NI contributions Niall FitzGerald chairman of Unilever who received a total of £1 9m in 2001 including performance-related bonuses according to the company's annual report would have paid an extra £18957 32 based on his salary that year Lord Browne chief executive of BP who earned almost £2 8m in 2001 not including an incentive scheme which may or may not be taxed would have expected to pay another £27957 32 Employers will also be required to pay an increased National Insurance Charge of 11 8 per cent for their employees from next year Meanwhile the chancellor has announced he will freeze until 5 April 2004 the tax-free earnings allowance of £4615 The 10 per cent tax charge on the first £1920 of taxable income whatever its source will not be frozen nor will the 22 per cent charge currently levied on the next 29920 of income ,3
2002-06-20, Gerhard Schroder the German chancellor yesterday endeavoured to regain the upper hand in the unfolding election campaign by ridiculing the tax-cutting promises of Edmund Stoiber the conservative candidate for the chancellorship Reacting to Mr Stoiber's rapturous reception at this week's pre-election conference of the opposition Christian Democrats Mr Schroder used a news conference on his government's 2003 budget to pour scorn on his rival's economic programme Attacking the opposition's plans for massive tax cuts as completely irresponsible Mr Schroder warned implementation would mean breaking Germany's commitments under the European Union's stability and growth pact However he dismissed the risk of that happening as he said the opposition itself knew its electoral promises could never be put into effect Mr Schroder stressed his government's success in tackling the legacy of economic mismanagement left by former chancellor Helmut Kohl and painted a picture of financial rectitude since his Social Democrat-led coalition took office in 1998 Describing next year's budget as sensible and responsible he said We're not making any promises than cannot be financed  The draft 2003 budget approved by the cabinet yesterday envisages a fall in net new borrowing to {XEU}15 5bn $14 57bn from {XEU}21 1bn in 2002 Followed by a reduction to {XEU}10 2bn in 2004 Germany would be in line with its EU commitments to have a budget close to balance by the end of 2004 said Hans Eichel finance minister Mr Eichel stressed that while next year's spending would fall by 0 5 per cent to {XEU}246 3bn the budget left room for increases in politically sensitive areas such as social security Expenditure by the labour ministry the biggest single item is due to rise by 1 3 per cent to {XEU}93 4bn next year Mr Eichel said next year's budget would be boosted by {XEU}6bn in privatisation receipts Some {XEU}5bn would derive from shares in Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Post Mr Schroder had to concede however that the SPD's own election manifesto contained promises the government would not be able to keep if re-elected Most strikingly its planning leaves no room for increasing child benefits in the next legislature in spite of the SPD's manifesto commitments to helping families ,3

2002-06-24, Rose Marie Bravo chief executive of Burberry the GUS-owned fashion house is set to become the highest-paid female executive at a publicly-quoted UK company by being awarded a new pay package worth more than £10m The package will include shares and options and will come on top of the £1m base salary and £10000 annual clothing allowance she already receives A 51-year-old New Yorker Ms Bravo was poached from Saks Fifth Avenue the US department store in 1997 Details of her remuneration including the financial targets that must be met before it is awarded will be revealed today when Burberry publishes its flotation prospectus GUS is next month expected to float up to 25 per cent of Burberry valuing the company at between £1 2bn and £1 5bn The company and its advisers at Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were finalising details of the pricing last night The company will today also announce the make-up of the Burberry board which will include three or four new non-executive directors one of which will be a GUS representative The prospectus will also provide a trading update since Burberry's year-end results at the end of March Trading at luxury goods companies was hit hard by the fall in tourism and sluggish demand after September 11 In April GUS insisted the trading difficulties were short-term even as its wholesale order book for its autumn-winter 2002 range indicated that sales were likely to be flat That compares with 6 per cent underlying growth in wholesale operations from the spring-summer order book That the flotation remains on target suggests that Burberry's trading was not as disappointing as Gucci's first quarter results which came in below analysts' expectations If the luxury goods market does not improve rival Prada could again delay its flotation plans Burberry is giving its iconic check pattern a diminishing exposure because of changes in fashion and fears of over-use ,2
2002-06-18, At atime when western Europe is moving towards the right notably in France central and eastern Europe seem to be sliding in the opposite direction The victory of the Social Democrats in the Czech election is the third success in a year for the left in the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe First the ex-communist SLD triumphed over the remnants of the Solidarity movement in Poland last autumn Last month Hungary's Socialists ousted the centre-right Fidesz movement and its outspoken leader Viktor Orban Now the Social Democrats have retained power in the Czech Republic beating the controversial former prime minister Vaclav Klaus But it would be wrong to see a serious ideological divide developing on the continent The leftist parties of central and eastern Europe are above all pragmatic They govern countries in which the economic freedom of action for governments is limited by a lack of funds and by the overriding desire to prepare for European Union accession Since memories of communism are still fresh it is difficult for leftist parties to resort to traditional socialist ideology even for rhetorical purposes This is especially true in Poland and Hungary where the leading leftist parties are the communist parties' direct heirs Instead the left-of-centre parties draw on social democracy matching economic progress with growing social justice They are also generally enthusiastic about the European Union Aleksander Kwasniewski Poland's president is an example of this mix skillfully turning himself from ex-communist official to Europhile social democrat If the left in the region sometimes seems insipid this cannot be said of the right The right and centre-right have made most of the political running in the region since 1989 and continue to do so often with great passion At first right-of-centre parties led the way in demolishing communism and in developing democracy and market-oriented economic restructuring But as voters tired of the pressure for change the centre-right parties fell into disarray When they regrouped the influence of the liberal intellectuals who led the anti-communist revolutions was often overtaken by assertive nationalists The picture is clearest in Hungary where Mr Orban endured the criticism of his former liberal allies to turn Fidesz into a movement with strong nationalistic overtones He moved so far to the right that he captured votes from Miep the party of the far-right In Poland the centre-right splintered last year with the political demise of the Solidarity movement Among the beneficiaries is Andrzej Lepper populist head of the Self-Defence movement who campaigns on a violently Eurosceptic ticket The Czech picture is complicated by the enduring presence of 60-year-old Mr Klaus who spoke out against excessive influence from Brussels a decade ago Today he tempers his message to avoid offence to pro-EU middle class supporters But he remains suspicious of EU-inspired initiatives In Slovakia another long-serving heavyweight dominates the right in the form of Vladimir Meciar the authoritarian former prime minister The key question in this autumn's election is whether the fragmented anti-Meciar parties can unite as they did four years ago to keep him out of power Liberals still make their influence felt For example in the Czech Republic the centrist Coalition which includes liberals is likely to join the government as a junior partner for the Social Democrats However theirs is no longer a dominant voice Vaclav Havel the former dissident remains Czech president but has negligible political influence Centrist forces are unlikely to recover their strength very soon Political life is increasingly polarised between right and left particularly in Poland and Hungary Mainstream parties are being forced to protect their flanks against the rise of populist forces on both left and right In Poland Mr Lepper has made the most noise increasing his support from 10 per cent in the autumn election to 17 per cent in the latest opinion polls In the Czech Republic the Communists caused the biggest shock this weekend increasing their vote to 18 5 per cent their best-ever result in democratic times They would leave Nato and on the current conditions would drop EU accession Andrzej Rychard a Polish political scientist argues that in this political confusion the main divide is no longer between ex-communists and anti-communists but between supporters and critics of greater European integration While the pursuit of EU accession is accepted by most political leaders there is growing debate about the nature of the union with the left favouring more integration and the new right less In that they are similar to their western counterparts www ft com/left,3
2002-04-04, Equity markets were more upbeat as Wall Street opened higher on weaker energy prices Earlier Tokyo gained nearly 2 per cent as public pension funds went on the business year's first real buying spree But investors were still looking for evidence that economic recovery would feed through to profits and worries persisted that conflict in the Middle East would push up oil prices and company costs These are the two themes plaguing most investors' minds said James Montier at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein The markets have been moving sidewards despite strong economic recovery since the beginning of the year Analysts' forecasts have been mainly about margin reflation cost-cutting or increasing prices and neither of these is likely in the near future So investors are right to be sceptical that economic growth will trans-late into higher profits in the immediate future he said Wall Street opened slightly higher as weakening energy prices provided some respite and investors returned to the technology sector after a bout of selling There was little in corporate news to boost confidence except from chemicals group DuPont which said it expected quarterly earnings to match estimates Europe briefly picked up on the strength of insurers chemicals and telecom-munications stocks The chemical sector hit a high for the year and Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB jumped on news it had resolved its immediate credit problems But the markets lacked enthusiasm drifting in tight trading ranges as investors remained cautious and companies failed to provide new stimuli Marianne Brun-Rovet,2
2002-04-29, Sir Richard Branson plans to float at least eight companies from his Virgin empire step down as their chairman and slow the rate of new start-ups in a strategy that could see him surrender his majority stake in Virgin Atlantic The flagship airline brand co-owned by Singapore Airlines since 1999 is now slated for flotation as soon as 2004-05 in spite of Sir Richard's pledge last autumn that nothing would persuade him to divest his 51 per cent controlling interest He is understood to be proposing to dilute his stake to as little as 30 per cent provided a controlling shareholding could be maintained by certain London-based institutions Overall his planned moves to be implemented over the next eight years could add as much as £2bn to the £1 3bn that Sir Richard has raised in the past three years from whole and partial trade sales The strategy marks a turnround from Virgin's previous stance on going public Virgin Group the empire's former holding company spent a troubled two years on the stock market in the mid-1980s before Sir Richard took it private again complaining that the City was short-termist and misunderstood him There is now only one public company in the empire Virgin Express the Brussels-listed European airline 59 per cent of which remains in Sir Richard's hands It will be a significant departure from past practice for Sir Richard to let go of the reins of management He holds 55 directorships in the UK alone most of them Virgin companies and is chairman of the majority of Virgin's 270 trading companies worldwide In an interview he said I would step down as chairman of any company we take public in future There would be no place for me on the board both for reasons of good corporate practice and personal time management My skills are more in creating and building companies  His declaration follows the resignation 10 days ago of Stelios Haji-Iaonnou as chairman of Easyjet the low-cost airline that he founded in 1995 and floated last year As Sir Richard takes his companies public and steps back from running them he will focus on the international expansion of the next candidates for flotation He plans to accompany his change of heart about the City with a change of heart about the Inland Revenue Since 1984 the bulk of the empire's holding companies have been domiciled offshore mainly in the British Virgin Islands I would like to move the Virgin holding companies back onshore within two years he said The pledge is dependent on the implementation of government plans to ease the rate of corporate tax on reinvested capital gains Back down to earth Page 24 www ft com/uk,2
2002-06-07, Nortel Networks was last night on the verge of pricing an $800m offering of shares and convertible securities after a dismal week that saw the networking company's share price tumble to levels not seen in almost two decades The fact that Nortel was proceeding with the issue amid the current Wall Street gloom suggested the company was increasingly desperate to shore up its cash reserves to help it outlast the prolonged downturn in telecommunications spending Shares in Nortel which started the week at $2 21 have been hammered by short sellers over the past few days in anticipation of the pending offering Nortel shares sank another 12 per cent yesterday to close at $1 41 in New York Some company watchers suggested the offering would dilute Nortel's 3 2bn share base by an additional 450m-500m shares Critics have argued that Nortel made a crucial mistake by delaying the offering in hopes the market would rebound Instead the outlook for telecoms spending has only become worse in the recent months with a rebound not expected until late 2003 or 2004 As a result Nortel's slumping share price has made the issue all the more dilutive as the company has to issue more shares in order to raise the same amount of financing The Canadian company has $4 8bn in debt and UBS Warburg recently forecast that Nortel would need to raise at least $1 6bn to remain properly funded through 2003 People familiar with the situation said the offering was due to be priced later on Thursday and that the common stock issue was twice oversubscribed while the convertible offering was three times oversubscribed Nortel said earlier this week it would issue 150m common shares as well as three-year securities convertible into common shares The securities were expected to carry a 7-7 5 per cent dividend and be convertible at a premium of 18-22 per cent over the share price at the time of sale Nortel which has slashed its workforce in half over the past year lost more than $27bn in 2001 and earlier this year had its credit rating cut to junk status ,2
2002-06-06, Archipelago staff knew from the beginning that the vision of its founder and chief executive Jerry Putnam was to transform the electronic communications network ECN into a fully fledged stock exchange If all goes according to plan Mr Putnam's ambition will become a reality by the autumn when Archipelago aims to have completed the roll-out of both NYSE listed and Nasdaq stocks on to its trading platforms and offer clients a seamless one-stop way of executing trades This transition from ECN to an exchange is like the transition from homo erectus to homo sapiens says Kevin O'Hara general counsel at Archipelago The route from a start-up company riding the wave of the late 1990s equities market boom by offering a platform for the booming shares to trade to a full-fledged stock exchange with a national order book has been relatively short and steeply upward-bound defying the ever gloomier environment prevalent in stock markets as the gains faded The elements of Archipelago's success so far are obvious according to Mr O'Hara who describes the process as the competent execution of a visionary strategy The arrival of Archipelago and other ECNs was prompted by the implementation of Order Handling Rules OHR in late 1996 by the Securities and Exchanges Commission The new rules allowed ECNs to interact with Nasdaq in order to execute stock trading orders In its first two years of existence Archipelago saw trading volumes increase to 10m shares a day attracting the attention and capital of strategic investors such as Goldman Sachs ETrade JP Morgan Instinet Merrill Lynch and the television news channel CBNC The company filed with the SEC in August 1999 seeking approval to become a national securities exchange but was able to short-circuit a potentially long and testing regulatory approval process by merging with the Pacific Exchange in 2000 thereby inheriting its rules and regulations which had already been approved by the SEC In the wake of the deal only a filing to note a name change in those rules was necessary in order to form the Archipelago Exchange ArcaEx in October 2001 By then trading volumes were in excess of 260m shares daily Earlier this year it completed the merger with REDIBook another ECN thus creating the largest alternative trading platform with a volume of 460m shares traded daily Mr O'Hara thinks ArcaEx which will operate as a division of the Pacific Exchange will be able to attract clients by providing a venue to execute trades cheaply quickly and anonymously in both Nasdaq and listed shares It will create a unique order book whereby investors can view the depth of bid/ask spreads not just the best offer In addition to executing orders internally at sub-second speeds proprietary technology can send them to other marketmakers or ECNs in order to complete trades In a further bid to attract investors ArcaEx will aim to offer a compromise to the contentious issue of internalised trading or the matching of order flows by investment banks in-house rather than on the market Unlike the NYSE which strongly opposes the practice or Nasdaq which imposes no restrictions on it ArcaEx will allow internalised trades to be completed but only if the bid/ask spread is as good as or better than the market The reconciling approach is an attempt by ArcaEx to lure as many clients as possible both retail and institutional by offering cheap options to execute both small and large-size trades The latter tend to be internalised by banks and market-makers because of the sheer difficulty of executing them anonymously in traditional ways on the markets Archipelago started rolling listed stocks on to its ArcaEx trading platform and wants to ensure the technology is performing optimally before moving over-the-counter stocks to the new systems He contends that Archipelago's success so far is a rebuttal to the argument that ECNs could only survive in a bull market and a proof that competition ensured an incredible evolution in stock trading if the environment is well-regulated While admitting that market makers might have suffered from the opening to competition Mr O'Hara says the benefit of putting millions into investors' pockets outweighs that harm Andrei Postelnicu,2
1998-04-03, The decision to replace the lottery regulator with a five-member commission should not be seen as a pointer to reform in other regulated industries government officials said yesterday The Department of Trade and Industry said that the commission structure was one model that was being examined as part of the government's review of utility regulation But the lottery had unique characteristics which meant that a different approach might be appropriate It is a franchise system where one company gets a monopoly unlike the water electricity gas and telecoms industries said an official Ministers are keen to reduce the amount of discretion in the hands of individual regulators which they believe can lead to unpredictable and unaccountable decision making In opposition Labour expressed interest in moving to the commission model along the lines of US regulators The idea has also been advocated by Don Cruickshank the telecoms regulator who argues that a commission could bring together the specialist expertise necessary to oversee a complex industry such as communications In addition to the commission model with up to five members the government's recent discussion document asks for views on the replacement of individual regulators with a small executive board This would probably have three members with the chairman having a casting vote The document says that the idea of executive boards or commissions would address concerns that regulators have to cover too broad an area of economic activity The third option would be to require individual regulators to consult a statutory advisory group capable of reflecting the broad public interest on all key decisions The advantage of this approach would be that it builds on existing best practice with several regulators having appointed advisory boards already ,3
2002-04-05, The European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged yesterday but warned that rising oil prices meant eurozone inflation this year could be higher than once expected Wim Duisenberg the ECB president said the bank still hoped that annual inflation provisionally estimated at 2 5 per cent last month would fall below its 2 per cent target ceiling in May But he acknowledged for the first time that there was a slight risk that average inflation for the whole of 2002 might not be below 2 per cent Inflation rates during this year could turn out to be somewhat higher than previously expected he said On average we are confident it inflation will be below or close to 2 per cent  Mr Duisenberg was careful not to suggest that the ECB was already thinking in terms of raising interest rates because of the inflation risks stemming from higher oil prices He said the ECB's main interest rate which has stood at 3 25 per cent since last November was appropriate for maintaining medium-term price stability the same formulation the ECB has used since the start of this year High oil prices were the main reason inflation overshot the ECB's 2 per cent ceiling in 2000 and 2001 The price of London Brent crude oil futures rose yesterday to almost $28 a barrel its highest for over six months The ECB has always stressed however that high oil prices are an external shock of the kind that is beyond the control of monetary policy Economists said that while the ECB was likely to raise interest rates this year it would try to give the eurozone time to consolidate its recovery before doing so So far the recovery has been modest a point underlined by industrial production data published yesterday which showed that month-on-month eurozone output was flat in January In December output rose by only 0 4 per cent rather than a previously estimated 0 8 per cent according to Eurostat the European Union's statistical agency A more positive signal came from a monthly survey of the eurozone's services sector which showed business activity expanding for the third straight month The Reuters-NTC Research index rose to 53 1 last month from 51 5 in February In Germany the eurozone's largest but most sluggish economy the national index recorded an expansion in service sector activity for the first time since April 2001 rising to 52 3 from 49 8 But unrest spread across Germany yesterday as IG Metall the largest industrial trade union called stoppages in support of its annual pay demand Workers from Verdi another union staged a similar warning strike at Frankfurt airport For regional reports www ft com/europe,2
2002-06-11, Instinet/Island That Instinet is paying for Island in stock could be an encouraging sign that Island's private owners have faith in the combined group's prospects It also means that Instinet can now pay a special dividend first That allows Reuters which owns 83 per cent of Instinet to extract $207m of trapped cash Equally Instinet's battered stock might simply be the best thing on offer for Island's private equity holders The outlook for electronic communications networks is uncertain at best amid collapsing volume And with Nasdaq poised to launch its SuperMontage trading platform it is potentially very bleak indeed Having ousted Instinet's senior management Reuters gets a new and respected team The combined group offers greater liquidity accounting for some 21 per cent of Nasdaq trading Buying Island might even reduce margin pressure a little In the long term it is possible that the old-fashioned and high-cost Instinet platform will benefit from Island's technology To say the companies are being careful not to overpromise is an understatement Even paid in stock $508m or 23 times last year's net income is a pretty price If Nasdaq's SuperMontage is a success it threatens to undermine all the ECNs It is not clear how buying Island will make it easier for Instinet to withstand a successful SuperMontage and worrying that no one appears in a position to explain For Reuters Instinet with its new management should now be less of a distraction Over time it will no doubt sell down its holding from 62 per cent of the enlarged group For now who would want to buy it,2
2002-04-15, From the Czar's winter palace in St Petersburg to the shelves of the Moscow elite to kitchen tables in Vladivostok the Lomonosov Porcelain Factory has provided Russians with crockery for the past 258 years Unsurprisingly its takeover by a US investment fund was controversial There was a kind of allergic reaction says Daniel Buatois general director of the Lomonosov enterprise People in St Petersburg were upset that the factory was bought by Americans  But the hurdles faced by the western shareholders were not just a question of affronted national pride The fate of a celebrated brand the factory was founded by Peter the Great's daughter became a test-case for the rights of foreign investors to turn legal ownership of an enterprise into practical management in the face of obstruction by entrenched Soviet-era directors Through the mid-1990s the US-Russia fund paid $5m for a 35 per cent stake in the factory buying secondhand shares from companies that had acquired them since the factory's initial 1993 privatisation Together with another US fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co and two smaller shareholders they took a controlling stake and sought to install their own management The existing directors disputed the legality of the sale and denied the foreign investors access to their purchase A legal and public relations battle ensued culminating in a November 1999 court decision renationalising the factory the first such case in Russia's post-communist history A St Petersburg court ruled that the outside funds' share acquisition had violated the terms of the 1993 voucher privatisation scheme and that an historic asset should stay in Russian hands The foreign shareholders launched a campaign of lobbying and appeals resulting in a January 2000 federal court decision reversing the renationalisation Douglas Boyce vice-president of the US-Russia fund was hastily voted chief executive He finally occupied the general director's office with the help of armed bodyguards and spent the weekend there to ward off any old-guard counter-offensive Two years later all trace of the turf war has gone Earlier this year Mr Buatois replaced Mr Boyce who it transpired after September 11 was a US special forces reservist required in an undisclosed location to fight terrorism If Mr Buatois a soft-spoken Frenchman from the porcelain business in Limoges faces a less pugnacious task than his predecessor it is equally challenging to make the Lomonosov Factory competitive The factory didn't know what a customer was he says Until 1917 everything was made for and bought by the Czar Then in the Soviet era there were no real customers either  When Gosplan the Soviet state purchaser vanished companies scrambled for market share Lomonosov porcelain at least had a good enough brand to justify price rises in line with inflation The factory still produces staple kitsch Russian household tea sets but also promotes a luxury range for export Fifteen per cent of output is sold abroad up from a negligible proportion 10 years ago Mr Buatois's target is 35 per cent within five years Growth is possible say the current managers thanks to the underlying profitability that emerged once opaque Soviet-era finances had been unravelled and endemic theft stamped out Net profit in 2000 the year after the takeover was Rbs72m Structural changes might not be so quick The battle for control meant winning a propaganda war for the hearts of the factory's employees who feared for their jobs and heard court claims that a national treasure was in jeopardy The latter allegation was addressed by enlisting St Petersburg's Hermitage Museum to look after the factory's priceless antiques including imperial commissions and early Bolshevik agit-crockery painted by Russian avant-garde masters such as Kandinsky and Malevitch Today highly skilled painters earn about $250 per month although the factory average is closer to $150 Mr Boyce raised wages promptly on taking charge but labour is still cheap and there have been few redundancies The 1700 employees collectively own 16 per cent of the factory and are represented on the board Larissa one of the factory's army of middle-aged female employees says she would like wages to be higher but she is reconciled to the new management The factory is almost as old as the city itself and we are still making porcelain That is the most important thing he says Rafael Behr,2

2002-06-26, Last year was one of broken dreams for the private banking industry and there is little prospect that the nightmare will end this year As equity markets around the world declined so did the profits of an industry which had been seen by most banks investment banks and brokers as one of the great under-exploited seams According to Boston Consulting Group BCG a management consultant onshore revenues in Europe declined on average by about 12 per cent while costs rose by about 3 per cent as firms continued to invest Profits plunged on average by about 38 per cent although in some cases the fall would be sharper Declan Sheehan who runs JP Morgan's private bank in Europe the Middle East and Africa says In private banking people had believed it was immune to markets last year's performance of most leading private banks was a rude awakening  Firms suffered from a sharp decline in the amount of share trading by their clients According to BCG the average amount of time investors hold stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market rose last year for the first time in years When clients did trade they did so in smaller ticket sizes This hit commissions in European onshore firms by almost 10 per cent Furthermore as markets fell so did the value of clients' assets This knocked fees in asset management products At the same time clients tended to move from equities to fixed income investments and money market funds which bring lower margins The number of people with $250000 to invest has dropped and the mass affluent on whom so many hopes rested have suffered a very real decline in their wealth Research by BCG shows there were 2 3m fewer wealthy households in 2001 than in the previous year and they had $2600bn less in net investments As aconsequence BCG estimates that the average cost to income ratio for wealth management firms rose from 60 per cent in 2000 to 72 per cent last year In order to recover their former levels of efficiency without an increase in activity this year firms will have to cut costs by at least 10 per cent Mr Sheehan says JP Morgan's private bank the product of merging JP Morgan Chase Manhattan Robert Fleming and Hambrecht & Quist cut expenses by almost 10 per cent Generally however Christian de Juniac a senior member of the financial services practice at BCG says Firms have not been able to achieve cost reductions in line with revenue reductions In the US people have been much more active about it it is easier if you have a network of brokers but they still have a long way to go  Some outfits have sought to counter the declining equity markets by altering the products they offered Marianne Hay head of private wealth management for Morgan Stanley in Europe and the Middle East says We responded to the difficult market conditions with diversification for example offering a fund of hedge funds offering capital guaranteed products and having a higher component of fixed income in our balanced portfolios  The downturn has thrown up some grim inefficiencies For example analysts believe that more than half most private banks' customers have net investments which are below the minimum set by their banks Most of these are unprofitable clients Analysts estimate that to provide a full service to clients with $5m-$20m costs about $60000 a year Anyone with less than $5m invested is unlikely to be covering the bank's costs unless they are moved to a much reduced service Many propositions aimed at mass affluent clients with about $200000 of invested assets failed because the economics of the firms allowed them to afford on average about six hours a year of front office time with such clients Understandably these clients had higher expectations than that Merrill Lynch and HSBC recently announced the demise of the internet-based partnership which they launched amid great fanfare and promises to invest $1bn in April 2000 Having fallen dramatically short of expectations it is being absorbed into HSBC after Merrill decided to pull out of the joint venture It is a bit of a crisis time for a lot of organisations in this sector says Michael Maslinski a consultant on the banking sector Many of them have been found out by the falling market Many were not delivering what they promised But they were shielded from that by the fact that markets had been rising and clients were happy to pay a lot for not very much  For all the talk of providing advice the central business model is little more than flogging investment products and portfolio management he believes They claim to be painting on a wide canvas but it's really rather a narrow one  Some analysts believe that the fall of the markets the bursting of the internet bubble and Enron are going to shift power back away from the aggressive US banks back towards smaller more considered more personal financial advisers Many wealth management outfits especially those from some of the larger banking and investment banking groups were built around offering privileged access to initial public offerings and privileged access to institutional equity research both of which have proven quite expensive privileges It is not necessary to be aware of every investment opportunity in the world It is necessary to miss out on opportunities that are going to lose you a fortune says Mr Maslinski At the top end of the market this could present an enormous opportunity for family offices such as Sand Aire or Fleming Family & Partners which serve the very wealthy families The trend towards independence is going through the whole market and an institution has a massive choice to make between whether it is a product provider a relationship manager or whether it can be a credible combination of the two says Mr Maslinski However Ms Hay still believes there are huge growth opportunities in private banking and that there will continue to be advantages for the integrated offering Each individual client is looking for a very tailor-made service she says Morgan Stanley's wealth management business which targets clients with $5m or more does offer products from third party providers Mr Sheehan adds Clients want to use our investment engine to tailor their portfolio to their needs We would still offer third-party products and on an increasing basis But you don't have to have one or the other You can have a combination of the two  But there are other more secular challenges for private banks too Chiefly the growing importance of onshore tax-aware investing as increased disclosure and lower taxes have reduced the attractions of sending funds to be managed offshore In Europe banks have to offer a local service in each European market taking into account the tax environment in each jurisdiction JP Morgan is undaunted but others are more reluctant This diversity in Europe is one of the factors which has held back most banks including US ones who were initially very enthusiastic from throwing themselves across the continent However the more pressing challenge is also the more prosaic Just like ordinary investors on the high street private bankers on both sides of the Atlantic are praying for an improvement in the equity markets ,2
2002-06-03, Baron Alexandre Lamfal-ussy the driving force behind the acceleration of reform of Europe's securities markets has warned that the European Commission may have to intervene if exchanges and other bodies do not find ways to make it cheaper and easier to clear and settle cross-border trades Baron Lamfalussy was speaking at the annual convention of the Federation of Securities Exchanges On the subject of making clearing and settlement more efficient he said I wouldn't exclude public intervention if the appropriate consolidation is not taking place  He added that he would prefer to see the exchanges reach their own agreements on arrangements A solution should be in the hands of the private sector he said A number of initiatives are taking place  Merger talks have been held between London Clearing House and Paris-based Clearnet and between Crest and Brussels-based Euroclear However the merger between Deutsche Borse owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and settlement house Clearstream earlier this year was viewed by some market participants as a threat to transparency of costs because it created a single trading clearing and settlement operation a so-called vertical silo In November a report from former Banca di Roma executive Alberto Giovannini written on behalf of the European Commission identified 15 factors that make cross-border trades more expensive than domestic ones These included the fragmented structure of the industry but also differing taxes and laws among European countries A cross-border trade in Europe costs roughly seven times as much as a domestic one Cross-border trading is expected to grow strongly following introduction of the euro which has created a single investing market especially for big European fund managers Clearing and settlement are the parts of a transaction where essential post-trade processing takes place ensuring the two parties have entitlement to their sides of the trade and then completing the transaction by matching the assets to be exchanged and transferring those assets The Commission's paper on clearing and settlement revealed in the Financial Times last week will be formally published today Market participants should not be constrained in making investment decisions by the location of counterparty securities or infrastructure it says It gives interested parties until the end of August to make further comment At present Germany requires that trades done on its exchanges must also be cleared and settled in Germany The moves form part of a broader effort to update the Investment Services Directive of 1993 ,1
2002-06-06, Frederick Grede has a straightforward approach when it comes to pursuing alliances with other bourses The chief operating officer of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing HKEx the company that runs the territory's stock market cites Jerry Maguire the Hollywood film in which Cuba Gooding Jr plays a professional footballer whose most famous line is Show me the money I simply say 'Show me the money' Let's go to where the biggest pools of capital are and try to attract them says Mr Grede In line with this philosophy HKEx recently announced a proposal with the London Stock Exchange to allow co-trading of stocks on each other's markets and to make dual-listings easier With European capital markets already rapidly consolidating and those in the US expected to follow suit most analysts believe Asia needs to see many more such tie-ups if it is not to be left behind Individually Asian markets have been among the world leaders in terms of restructuring Over the past four years Australia Hong Kong Singapore and Tokyo have ended their former club-like mutual status and become profit-oriented corporations All with the exception of Tokyo have listed their shares Forming meaningful global and regional alliances with other bourses however has proved a much more complicated task Early efforts have been made in this direction The Singapore Stock Exchange SGX and Tokyo Stock Exchange last year announced plans to form a strategic alliance to broaden distribution and improve liquidity of products traded on both markets The region has yet to see the deeper levels of co-operation let alone mergers and acquisitions that have been occurring in Europe The region has more than a dozen bourses many of them tiny by global standards and each with different currencies and rules and regulation Most countries also remain reluctant for nationalistic reasons to allow outsiders to buy large equity stakes in their stock markets Expansion regionally is still a few years down the road says Stephen Kam an analyst with Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong referring to HKEx Each of the different countries essentially would like to stay as independent as possible  The region's position in global timezones does not always work in its favour either Hong Kong tried trading Nasdaq stocks but received a disappointing response The stocks did not draw enough interest from buyers in the US who are mostly either sleeping or getting ready for bed when the Hong Kong market is open Twenty-four hour trading is not yet enough of a reality globally to ensure adequate liquidity HKEx's tie-up with London which opens during Hong Kong's afternoon should work better The hours match up much better so we would in essence be the pre-market session for London and they would be the after-hours session for Hong Kong stocks says Mr Grede Despite the challenges to consolidation in Asia most commentators agree that the rising cost of new technology shrinking margins and the need for economies of scale will eventually force Asian markets to start banding together more closely Mr Grede argues that the cost of future trading systems alone at up to $60m may become prohibitively high for smaller markets While we might be able to afford it how's Malaysia Thailand or the Philippines going to afford those kinds of investments Mr Grede asks He says future co-operation might be forged around common trading platforms as has been the case in Europe The final configuration of any future alliances remains anyone's guess But most analysts believe the wild card will be China The mainland's domestic A-share market is Asia's second largest after Tokyo with a market capitalisation of about $500bn At present mainland Chinese investors are not permitted to place this money offshore But Beijing is considering allowing qualified domestic institutional investor schemes that would enable limited fund outflows Eventually when China moves to full currency convertibility its capital markets will become one of the most important in Asia alongside Tokyo For other Asian markets the challenge of the next decade will be how to align themselves more closely with these two giants Whoever can successfully tap those two liquidity pools in Asia will have amazing strength to then negotiate with the other large liquidity pools for better terms and conditions says John Ott head of the East Asian financial institutions practice with McKinsey & Co in Hong Kong In other words the old rule show me the money will become more important than ever among Asian capital markets ,2
2002-04-26, Bertie Ahern Ireland's prime minister yesterday launched his Fianna Fail party's manifesto for next month's general elections with a pledge to use the debt markets to finance future public infrastructure development Speaking in Dublin just hours after confirming the May 17 poll date Mr Ahern spoke of a radical departure for funding big infrastructural projects through a new National Development Agency if returned to power The plan would involve the issuance of up to {XEU}2bn £1 4bn a year of project-related bonds Officials insisted this would not add to the public deficit as the funds would be treated as non-government borrowing through the creation of the agency which would act as the issuer He said a new approach was needed because the reality is we were spending small money now we're spending big money How to improve Ireland's overstretched public infrastructure will be one of the main issues in Ireland's three-week election campaign which is widely expected to see Fianna Fail returned with the largest number of seats in the 166-member Dail or lower house of parliament Mr Ahern has headed a two-party coalition government with the right-of-centre Progressive Democrats for the past five years a record period for peacetime in Ireland He ruled out the prospect of Fianna Fail securing an outright majority The decision to call the election in May was widely expected In the six years to 2006 the government is committed to spending {XEU}54bn on roads rail ports schools and other public infrastructure using state funds European money and private sector finance through public private partnerships PPPs However implementation has been hampered by planning and other disputes Mr Ahern said there were 30 to 40 PPP projects at one stage or another But only one has been successfully negotiated a project for five schools being built and managed by Jarvis the UK company with financing by Barclays Officials say one of the problems with PPP where the contractor is the borrower is that the finance costs are much higher than the conventional government procurement contracts where Ireland is the borrower Mr Ahern said part of the motivation was also to reduce the government's dependence on outside consultants Asked why lenders would invest in such bonds Charlie McCreevy the finance minister said Because they would be government backed  However he maintained that the borrowings would not be included in the calculation of Ireland's national debt He also insisted that everything in the manifesto is about sticking to the EU's stability and growth pact This requires that European Union countries keep public finances close to balance over an economic cycle with substantial fines applied if the deficit of 3 per cent of gross domestic product is reached ,3

2002-06-26, Prices on government bonds fell yesterday as investors moved back into rising stock markets In recent weeks government bonds have risen sharply on the back of a slide in equity markets around the world Traders said stock markets were still the driving force but now they were causing price falls instead of gains The rebounding stock market pushed US government bond prices lower yesterday despite a deterioration in consumer confidence The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to 106 4 in June from 110 3 in May slightly better than forecast Nevertheless the index indicated that labour market conditions continued to weaken and that economic growth remained moderate Stocks took heart in the fact that consumer confidence had not deteriorated as much as feared and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 88 points at midday on Wall Street Existing home sales also held up well in May with demand underpinned by low mortgage rates and the new popularity of real estate as a long-term investment option according to Greenwich Capital Markets The 10-year US Treasury note was down {11/32} to 99 at midday to yield 5 878 per cent and the 30-year bond had fallen {7/16} to 98{3/8} to yield 5 488 per cent The two-year note was {1/16} lower to 100{19/32} to yield 2 922 per cent Although much of the spotlight is on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week the outcome is expected to be no change in interest rates Things are likely to stay that way until there are clearer signs of the US recovery gaining a stronger footing said analysts at Bear Stearns In Europe there was also profit-taking on bonds But traders said they did not think government bonds would lose all their recent gains Equity markets are still volatile and many investors will still want the safety of bonds said one There's profit-taking going on  The two-year German schatz yield rose by 6 7 basis points to 4 023 per cent The 10-year German bund yield was up 5 4bp to 4 981 per cent In the UK the 10-year gilt yield was 7 9bp higher at 5 048 per cent Japanese government bond futures prices rose after a worrisome JGB auction went smoothly and following a day of lacklustre trade in equities The government auctioned Y1800bn in new 10-year paper with a year-low coupon of 1 3 per cent Before the sale traders were concerned that the low coupon would not attract enough buyers Their worries appeared unfounded as JGB futures prices continued to rise in evening trade Early enthusiasm on the equities markets quickly soured also giving bonds a buying boost The bond market will expect the Bank of Japan which holds its policy board meeting today to keep its policies unchanged The key September 10-year JGB future contract rose 0 05 to 138 94 The 10-year cash JGB rose 0 133 to 100 839 pushing the yield down 0 015 to 1 305 ,2
2002-06-24, One of the first tasks of every new chief executive is to step out of the shadow of his predecessor For Burkhard Poschadel the German-born head of GAM that has been quite a task His predecessor was Gilbert de Botton the firm's erudite founder But Mr Poschadel a soft-spoken former academic and veteran of UBS the Swiss banking giant that bought GAM three years ago says his appointment as chief executive marked a break with the past He took over in 2000 after Mr de Botton who sold GAM to UBS for $675m £462m died suddenly at the age of 65 Mr Botton had established GAM in 1983 with $1m of capital It quickly became known for its expertise in hedge funds and fund of hedge funds What remains is the business model but my style is very different from that of the founder Mr Poschadel says at GAM's London offices We are implementing a management structure that is no longer centred on one person  The new structure will be based on a seven-strong business committee including GAM's global divisional heads This team will report to the board of directors of GAM Holding AG a new Swiss holding company chaired by Hans de Gier who is also vice-chairman of UBS Mr Poschadel will be a member of the committee and the board His management reshuffle comes amid fierce competition within the global hedge fund industry Last month the UK's Man Group acquired Swiss rival RMF for $833m creating a company with almost $20bn of assets under management Mr Poschadel says GAM with its $17 6bn of assets will stay clear of overpriced acquisitions opting instead for organic growth The big question is who will be the Fidelity of the hedge fund world in five years' time he says Man and RMF are claiming this title and we will see a lot more of that  One of the battle grounds is the fast-growing market for fund of hedge funds a $100bn industry that Mr de Botton helped to create His idea was to persuade wealthy private clients to invest in funds that allocated money to top hedge fund managers In this way investors could spread their risk while reaching some of the finest stock-pickers This was an unfashionable idea since private clients were typically assigned a single fund manager But GAM's early entry to this market is paying off We have one of the longest track records in fund of hedge funds says Mr Poschadel and we have reached a size that allows us to reinvest revenues into the growth of our operation  Fund of hedge funds account for about 40 per cent of GAM's funds under management and play a vital part in its three business areas private client portfolios institutional portfolios and mutual funds The stock market boom of the 1990s has led to an explosion in GAM's mutual fund business which accounts for almost half of its assets This says Mr Poschadel has created a need to rebalance the overall group His strategy is two-pronged First he is focusing on GAM's private client business which he expects to double to $9bn of funds under management by the end of 2004 He believes GAM will benefit from the emergence of a new generation enjoying the benefits of inherited wealth the so-called Erbengeneration The new generation is even more sophisticated than the old one and is very open to our products including hedge funds he says Yet by returning to its private client roots GAM will be going head-to-head with the fund management businesses of traditional Swiss private banks which are locked in a bitter fight for market share This has been illustrated by the merger this month of Lombard Odier and Darier Hentsch Mr Poschadel says GAM has no intention of entering private banking These banks are offering a comprehensive range of services he says whereas we want to remain a pure asset manager  The firm already benefits from its relationship with UBS Private Banking whose clients account for a quarter of GAM's funds under management Mr Poschadel is confident that GAM will be able to retain its special status within UBS which recently integrated its collection of local fund management businesses including the UK-based Phillips & Drew under its UBS Global Asset Management brand What UBS bought 2{1/2} years ago was not just $14bn of assets but a distinct business model and a brand he says If they were to integrate GAM it would destroy the business model  The second part of Mr Poschadel's strategy is to focus on the firm's institutional business which is expected to benefit from a growing interest in alternative investments amid poor equity returns Potential clients include pension funds in Switzerland the US and Canada with those in the UK expected as he puts it to put their toes into the water I think the perception that we have racy hedge fund products is wrong says Mr Poschadel Some of our fund of hedge funds have a lower volatility than the respective benchmarks  GAM prides itself on using rigorous screening methods including face-to-face interviews to pick and monitor its fund managers It invests in more than 100 different hedge funds with a third being replaced each year He concedes that industry-wide returns have been poor in the last two years One of the reasons was the lack of themes that managers could play on he says He believes that equity long/ short funds could still perform well in the medium term Yet for all his confidence in his strategies Mr Poschadel's mettle remains untested He may have left the shadow of his predecessor but he has yet to make a lasting difference to the business ,1

1998-04-02, The Cool Britannia syndrome yesterday spread to the Foreign Office where Robin Cook announced a panel of 33 luminaries to transform Britain's image around the world The team which includes an eclectic mix of style gurus politicians and Labour-supporting businessmen has been charged with selling Britain as a nation of flair and innovation Tony Blair will today join the rush to rebrand the country when he tours a grey tent resembling a giant bouncy castle erected in Horseguards Parade London as a temporary design showcase The location of the powerhouseuk exhibition appears to have been chosen to represent the new Britain rising in a venue associated with royalty pomp and ceremony It consists of a series of pods containing such diverse products as artificial limbs a Jasper Morrison shopping trolley and the artwork from the new Pulp album The foreign secretary who has been presenting a rather confrontational image of Britain on his recent overseas trips yesterday lent his weight to the rebranding exercise Launching the Panel 2000 group Mr Cook said There could be no more important task for the Foreign Office than to convey to those around us apositive and accurate image of the modern Britain  In the vanguard of the Cook revolution are such talents as Stella McCartney the designer Judy Simpson the athlete Ruth Mackenzie of Scottish Opera and Zeinab Badawi of Channel 4 News The panel will be chaired by Derek Fatchett the foreign office minister but will also include more predictable figures such as Peter Mandelson minister without portfolio and Mark Fisher arts minister Lord Levy and Lord Paul two prominent business donors to the Labour party are also included ,3

2002-06-26, Early gains evaporated on Wall Street as the bears charged back into the market triggering a sharp sell-off in the stock indices The selling continued for the sixth straight week as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 155 points lower at 9126 82 The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite flirted near their September 21 lows for the second time this week The S&P 500 shed 16 58 to 976 14 while Nasdaq fell 36 33 to 1424 01 Volume was heavy with about 1 5bn trades in the NYSE The follow-through from the previous session's gains was short-lived which did not surprise many traders Peter Coolidge senior equity trader at Brean Mur ray & Co said the market saw an early technical bounce because of oversold conditions However the market continued to lack a catalyst to take it out of its doldrums The latest economic data showed that the consumer confidence index fell in June at its fastest pace since immediately after the September 11 attacks suggesting consumers are losing faith in the recovery The Federal Reserve may see this as more evidence to justify leaving interest rates unchanged at its two-day monetary policy meeting that ends today There is increasing talk that rates may stay at 1 75 per cent for the remainder of the year DuPont the chemical company attracted buying interest but the downbeat mood cut into its gains Shares rose 0 3 per cent to $43 24 after it raised its second-quarter earnings estimates L3 Communications the defence and electronics maker was among the most actively traded stocks in the NYSE after the company raised $800m in a public offering on Monday but shares fell 3 7 per cent to $54 51 Dial rose 4 6 per cent to $20 38 after the company said second-quarter earnings would beat expectations FedEx however fell 14 3 per cent to $48 after it said it expected first-quarter earnings to fall below estimates Financials lost their early lustre as Citigroup reversed gains falling 1 2 per cent to $39 12 JP Morgan shed 0 8 per cent to $32 93 and American Express gave up 2 1 per cent to $36 32 Merck lost 1 per cent to $49 05 but Abbott Laboratories was a bright spot up 2 4 per cent to $38 11 Toronto was also unable to hang on to early gains The S&P/TSx composite index fell 8 25 or 0 12 per cent to 7121 68 after an intraday high of 7176 l61 Techs slid again with Celestica down 5 8 per cent to C$34 20 and Nortel down 0 8 per cent to C$2 05 Even gold stocks the one group showing promise recently slipped 1 3 per cent Placer Dome fell 1 5 per cent to C$19 10 ,2
2002-06-05, The recent demise of Atriax a foreign exchange trading platform might seem to have driven yet another nail in the coffin of internet trading exchanges But while B2B exchanges have failed so spectacularly in many other industries experts believe internet trading is here to stay in the foreign exchange market even if Atriax and perhaps one or two other FX portals fall by the wayside FX is the most commoditised of financial products and despite the growth of online trading systems to manage and settle orders much of the initial price discovery is still done on the phone Today a vast majority of FX trades are initiated using the telephone and the adoption rate of online system use is slow says a report from Meridien Research a financial consultancy Phone-based trading is seen as essential to the inter-dealer FX market and big multinationals with sizable currency exposures also like the human touch They typically have FX relationships with several banks and so phone around to find a better deal But most smaller corporate clients deal with one bank and their FX business is too meagre to justify banks reducing their standard bid-offer spreads These customers see FX trading not as a way to make money but simply a means to an end For a lot of customers FX is just a headache It is a by-product of another transaction or a trade in real-world goods says Jas Singh business development director at AVT Technologies a supplier of FX trading systems The arrival of the internet promised to democratise the FX business by allowing anyone to obtain competing quotes from a range of FX players simultaneously displayed on their screen Atriax was the most ambitious of these multi-bank FX portals and was founded in 2000 by Citibank JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank At the time of its launch in mid-2001 around 65 banks had agreed to participate in the venture accounting for over 50 per cent of global FX dealing Nevertheless it failed to revolutionise the FX world and after struggling against low volumes it closed its doors in April 2002 The three founding banks now contribute prices to FX Connect a rival online portal set up by State Street the custodian bank According to a recent Tower Group report FX Connect has a 75 per cent share of the online FX market Nevertheless this market has failed to live up to early expectations The daily volume of FX trades between banks and customers is around $500bn but that done via online portals is only a few billion dollars I remember seeing predictions that 70 per cent of FX transactions would go online I still see the same charts but now the dates get pushed back says Mike Whitaker director of marketing and strategy for Reuters' treasury business Reuters was one of the founders of Atriax Some observers blame the slow uptake on online FX portals on flawed trading models For example FXall provides a stream of prices in real time but these are only indicative The counterparty can move from the advertised price once a request is received Atriax used a different approach in which users submitted a request for a quote but to many potential users that seemed to offer little advantage over the old fashioned way of picking up the phone and asking for a quote But perhaps the biggest flaw facing the FX portals is that they were designed primarily to cut transaction costs and neglected the fact that FX trading is already highly efficient With telephone trading there's no exchange floor so there is very little opportunity to reduce costs says Andrew Murphy of PA Consulting Group Users of multi-bank trading portals such as FXall are likely to be disappointed if they were expecting to see tighter spreads from the banks  The demise of Atriax is seen as a small setback rather than a major catastrophe for the online FX industry and indeed by eliminating one competitor it strengthens the chances for the remaining portals The backers of Atriax seem not to have lost their enthusiasm for online FX trading As well as supplying FXConnect Citibank now also provides liquidity to FXall a rival multi-bank portal When the news came that Atriax would close Citibank wasted no time in reconfiguring its system to supply the rival portals Once such a reconfiguration would have required a major IT project But the use of off-the-shelf web technologies and IP-based networking made the job relatively straightforward Citibank had been using our network to connect to Atriax and once they made the decision to switch we had them connected to FXall by the end of the day says Brennan Carley chief product and technology officer at Radianz which runs an IP-based extranet for the financial industry According to Mr Carley this flexibility to rapidly plug into different liquidity pools is one of the biggest benefits of the internet revolution In the past banks would have to hard-wire their computer systems into a trading platform and install proprietary software As for the future of the FX portals experts believe they are not going to go away although they will have to rethink their business models and do more than display prices Multi-bank portals have a role to play but I do not think they are suited to all clients in the marketplace and they will need a higher adoption rate than is currently there says Richard Estes head of e-commerce at the Bank of New York the custodian bank BoNY holds a stake in FXall and developed multi-bank order management technology for the portal BoNY claims it remains committed to the multi-bank portal idea but the bank is also promoting its own proprietary FX trading software iFX Manager which was developed jointly with AVT and on which the multi-bank version is based This software automates the complete order management process of FX trades and so improves post-trade efficiencies which is the real challenge facing the FX industry Mr Estes believes Ironically perhaps iFX Manager automates everything apart from the price quotation process This is because BoNY believes its customers still prefer to obtain prices the old-fashioned way over the phone ,1
1998-04-03, Richard Branson's Virgin group plans to invest up to $60m £36m over the next three years on extending its UK cinema chain into the US and Japan Simon Burke chief executive of Virgin Entertainment said the company had assessed the potential for introducing Virgin Cinemas to other countries and had chosen the US and Japan as the most promising locations Virgin is now searching for suitable sites in those countries according to Mr Burke and intends to begin its expansion by constructing six multiplexes in each before developing larger chains The finances of the Virgin group particularly newer areas of activity notably trains and drinks have been dogged by controversy However so far the UK cinema chain which Virgin acquired by buying the MGM circuit for £195m in 1995 seems to have been one of its more successful investments Virgin acquired 116 UK cinemas from MGM but sold the 93 smaller theatres for £69m to a management buy-out team in 1996 It has since refurbished half the remaining 23 cinemas and opened six new multiplexes The group plans to spend roughly £90m over the next three years on building 22 other multiplexes in the UK the first of which is a 13- screen complex opening today in Birmingham Virgin has developed special facilities for its new cinemas including cafe-bars children's party rooms miniaturised versions of its Virgin Megastores and premium-priced Premier screening rooms with armchair seats and private bars Mr Burke said the encouraging response to its new cinemas in the UK had prompted the group to develop them in other countries It had considered diversifying into France Spain and Germany but its research suggested those markets would be too competitive Moving into the US and Japan makes more sense for Virgin particularly as the name is already well established there because of the airline and megastores said Mr Burke The US cinema market is notoriously overcrowded but Mr Burke said Virgin was certain there would be strong demand for its value-added multiplexes there ,1
1998-04-01, NTT Docomo Japan's dominant cellular phone group is taking a Y36bn $272m extraordinary loss in relation to its stake in NTT's personal handy-phone system PHS companies As a result Docomo cut its parent net profits forecast by Y43bn to Y21bn for the year to March 1998 The lower net profits which come on sales of Y1261bn and pre-tax profits of Y125bn reflect the extent to which the PHS business is weighing down on the NTT group Docomo has a 48 per cent stake in the nine PHS companies in the NTT group which have cumulative losses of Y240bn Docomo's profits revision follows NTT's statement that parent net profits in the year to the end of March would be Y188bn or 28 per cent lower than previously forecast because of losses in the PHS units NTT is taking a special loss of Y67bn in relation to the write-down of its PHS businesses PHS which is a cheaper and more restricted form of mobile communication compared with cellular phones has faced difficulties since its launch three years ago It was initially hailed as a convenient low-cost alternative to cellular phones but fierce competition saw handsets given away free and a high level of churn has led to mounting losses at most PHS companies The decline in cellular phone handset costs and in call rates has also eroded the main advantage of PHS over cellular phones PHS subscriptions in January declined by 68000 overall according to industry statistics The write-offs at NTT and Docomo suggest that NTT is planning to tackle the problems by either merging the companies with Docomo or liquidating the PHS companies and transferring assets to Docomo ,2
2002-06-21, The failure of big deals that attracted private equity houses to Germany has combined with damped expectations on the easing of tax on disposals to weaken the private equity sector There is now the danger that fresh tax laws will further weaken the industry The situation is so precarious that the European Venture Capital Association EVCA has expressed concern about the future of the German venture capital and buy-out sector Edoardo Bugnone EVCA chairman says Germany is the only country that is going against the tide  The uncertain situation has already affected fund raising No new funds have been launched since February 2001 due to the threatened taxation and the uncertain legal situation The prospects for 2002 are much blacker warns Holger Frommann managing director of the German Venture Capital Association BVK Yet over the past few years Germany has developed into an important market for private equity and venture capital investment According to a joint survey by the EVCA and the Global Technology Industry Group of PricewaterhouseCoopers the UK was still the leader with regard to total investment in 2001 Some 29 per cent {XEU}7bn of European investment was allocated to UK companies This was followed by Germany with 18 per cent {XEU}4 4bn Whether this development will continue is now questionable Ernst & Young and Venture One concluded in a recent report that Germany in comparison with Europe's leading countries is the clear loser While investment in the Federal Republic fell by almost 75 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 from {XEU}448m to {XEU}106m investment volume in the UK rose 2 4 per cent to {XEU}446m In France investment rose 24 per cent to {XEU}242m Julie Teigland responsible for Ernst & Young's venture capital division says An end to the downturn in Germany is not yet in sight  The private equity sector has been hit by bankruptcy and errors of judgment Illustrious names such as Apax Partners and Clayton Dubilier & Rice CDR once celebrated as the catalyst for overdue structural changes in Germany have endured failures Returns are down because holdings acquired at inflated prices in the years of euphoria can no longer be sold for a profit in recession At the end of 2000 Apax Partners paid {XEU}1bn for the state-owned Bundesdruckerei Sector competitors such as Giesecke & Devrient did not offer half that Another example of a big miscalculation was the investment by Allianz Capital Partners and Clayton Dubilier & Rice in the now insolvent regional aircraft maker Fairchild Dornier However there are rays of hope For a long time Germany was a disappointing market for private equity investors commented Chris Davison head of market research for Alt Assets in London There was an imbalance between interesting purchase opportunities in Germany and the economic strength of the German market  However institutional investors indicate this has improved Mr Davison says We are registering an unusually large interest  This is reflected in the behaviour of international private equity houses Candover a leading sector company is setting up its own German branch Until now it has operated on the German market from London and has named a leading light for this venture Kurt Kinzius worked for Mannesmann for 12 years before moving to Candover The decision may seem a brave one because many UK venture capital and private equity groups have withdrawn from Germany He says Germany remains an attractive market for the private equity sector one must have a presence here  The group is already in Germany with a stake in Vestolit the PVC manufacturer Recently Candover caused a sensation by acquiring Swissport the Swissair unit for SFr580m Other Anglo-American investors according to Alt Asset also want to expand in Germany Many German investors are restructuring and plan to work as niche boutiques German experts such as Maximilian Broenner of LGT Capital Partners see the development as positive The current consolidation will lead to the creation of some of the great German firms of the decade  He believes the German market has entered a mature phase and says Financial and structuring skills have become mainstream whereas operational and entrepreneurial expertise remain scarce  Consolidation will result in Germany increasingly adapting international practices of the buy-out and venture capital sector Minority financing of family firms or silent partnerships will die out in Germany forecasts Wilken von Hodenberg management board spokesman of Deutsche Beteiligungs He also considers worries over regulation is exaggerated He thinks there will be little change even when experience with financial investors has been gathered in Germany He says German family firms have very seldom prepared for a management buy-out  In the meantime the German private equity investor has become more critical Disillusion has spread in a sector used until recently to returns of up to 30 per cent Mr Broenner himself looking for successful investment teams said In the search for the best funds and fund of funds German investors now apply rigorous due diligence and only experienced teams with at least five to 10-year track records receive funding  There is also new caution through the sector Investors favour the secure harbour of umbrella funds which use their expertise to spread the risk These funds also impose key man clauses under which the departure of a named fund manager triggers withdrawal rights Private equity funds such as Apax with the mechanical engineer MPM or Carlyle with the rubber product manufacturer Contitech would rather let a deal fail than pay too much ,2
2002-06-28, After a promising start on Wall Street equities fell back in late morning trade yesterday as encouraging jobless data and upwardly revised first-quarter gross domestic product figures failed to pull the market out of the doldrums Skittish sentiment prevailed as investors grappled with corporate scandals the latest being WorldCom's alleged $3 8bn fraud revealed on Tuesday We have not had three back-to-back up days since late April All you have are these flurries that fade said Larry Wachtel of Prudential Financial So it's a'show me' attitude If you can put together three days the money will flow in But I doubt if this thing is going to hold together through the end of the day  The anxious mood was underscored as shares in General Motors which were briefly halted on the NYSE fell on rumours of accounting irregularities Shares were down 1 6 per cent at $52 25 GM said the rumours were totally unfounded and the company was not subject to any accounting investigation By midday the Dow Jones Industrial Average had erased gains of as much as 79 points and was down 30 67 at 9089 44 The S&P 500 index fell 2 33 to 971 20 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 2 69 at 1432 11 The US commerce department yesterday said first-quarter GDP grew at an upwardly revised annual rate of 6 1 per cent its fastest pace in more than two years Separately the US labour department said initial jobless claims fell 10000 to 388000 for the week to June 22 But the data were not enough to sustain a rally For the most part telecoms continued Wednesday's slide AT&T a Dow component fell 4 2 per cent to $9 22 and Nextel lost 3 2 per cent to $3 00 But Qwest Communications which lost 57 per cent on Wednesday added 16 2 per cent to $2 08 Shares of Micron Technology which fell 3 8 per cent on Wednesday added 6 3 per cent to $20 19 after Lehman Brothers upgraded the company to strong buy Computer Associates gained 0 3 per cent to $16 05 as Sam Wyly the Texas billionaire started another attempt to gain control of the software company's board Mr Wyly failed in a similar attempt last year Toronto hovered just inside positive territory by midday The S&P/TSX composite index was up 3 33 points at 7024 31 Healthcare stocks were up 1 3 per cent with Biovail gaining 63 cents to C$42 51 and MDS gaining 40 cents to C$24 70 The gold sector weighed in the opposite direction with a 1 9 per cent decline ,2
1998-04-02, Yashwant Sinha India's new finance minister yesterday sought to assure foreign investors of continuity of economic reforms and a big welcome for foreign investment in some sectors Mr Sinha said he aimed to take this message directly to investors in New York and London later this month on a visit planned around the annual World Bank/IMF meeting in Washington In his first interview with a foreign publication since taking office last month the finance minister said he aimed to dispel negative impressions surrounding the new Bharatiya Janata party-led government's economic nationalist policies of swadeshi  or self-reliance which includes discouraging foreign investment in some sectors We are interested in creating an investment regime which will ensure transparency speed and which will create a completely hassle-free regime for the foreign investor he said The minister said he hoped to deliver his first budget by early June and admitted facing a fine balancing act in seeking both to control India's high fiscal deficit 6 1 per cent of GDP last fiscal year and to kickstart a limping economy through higher spending on infrastructure and agriculture Mr Sinha said the BJP alliance favoured opening the state-owned insurance sector to the Indian private sector but not yet to foreign companies He also said the government would move swiftly on further public sector disinvestment and would continue to include international equity offerings as a component of such sales His message to foreign investors was that we are not out of another planet we are not Hindu nationalists as newspapers in the west describe us We are ready to welcome foreign investors in a very big way in sectors which we feel foreign investment has a major role to play  The BJP has broadly defined these sectors as including infrastructure and high-technology-based industries While there might also be a negative list of sectors where we may not need foreign investment he added We will define everything very very clearly But I would plead that we should not be judged negatively on the basis of this small list  Mr Sinha said We believe in the continuity of government policies we are committed to economic reforms we will carry forward the process of internal liberalisation much faster  But he added We will have to calibrate external liberalisation to ensure that the Indian economy is not thrown out of gear  The minister would not be drawn on whether he intended raising some import tariffs in his budget a growing plea from sections of Indian industry ,3

2002-04-19, SAP Europe's largest software company reported disappointing first-quarter software licence sales amid overall results that only just matched expectations yesterday but stuck to its forecasts for full-year margins and sales growth Software licence sales a closely-watched indicator of the company's performance fell more sharply than expected by 12 per cent to {XEU}402m $357m with a particularly marked decline in the Americas Consistency in the US is a key investor criterion so this is a disappointment said John Segrich at Goldman Sachs However it is not a bad performance relative to others in the sector  Siebel Systems the market leader in customer and sales software this week reported a 20 per cent fall in group revenues with software sales down 26 5 per cent while i2 Technologies said revenues had collapsed 72 per cent year-on-year Conditions for software purchases remain challenging SAP said and while Europe remains relatively strong businesses in the Americas are taking a more deliberate and measured approach to new software investments SAP's first-quarter sales rose 9 per cent to {XEU}1 66bn while operating profit before charges for stock-based compensation and acquisition costs rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to {XEU}237m SAP had been careful to damp expectations of a strong start to the year and it was clear the previous year's strong performance would be hard to match with little improvement in corporate IT spending likely before the second half But it nevertheless continues to expect 15 per cent sales growth and operating margins of at least 21 per cent in 2002 The 15 per cent target one of the strongest outlooks in the industry is challenging in the light of the difficult first quarter but nonetheless attainable with the fourth quarter traditionally key analysts said About a third of revenues are generated in the last three months of the year The pressure is on but they have aggressively cut back costs and have shown they can hit bottom line said Mr Segrich ,2
2002-04-17, Today's Budget is being portrayed as a gargantuan struggle between the good guys who want to put taxes up to pay for a better health service and the bad guys who want to leave taxes alone By implication these heartless rogues would starve the National Health Service of its birthright The reality is otherwise The Budget should be an occasion to ask why the increase in taxation since this government came to power has made so little impact on the quality of important public services Where has all the money gone Could some of it not be better spent We could begin by examining the extraordinary increase in public spending on transport There are no visible improvements and many signs that things are getting worse The most striking feature of the government's 10-year transport plan is how it combines high cost to the taxpayer with poverty of ambition The aim is to invest £180bn over 10 years This includes £27bn of subsidy for the railways and substantial sums on road maintenance and Highways Agency administration likely to exceed £12bn But London Underground is promised only £16bn over a 15-year period with much of that needed for renewal rather than expansion Meanwhile in the same 10-year period Britons are forecast to spend £180bn or so on new cars The main transport difficulty in Britain is that there is not enough of it Much of the policy debate agonises over how to switch at the margins from car and lorry to train and bus But the country is short of railway lines as well as of road space It needs big investment in new capacity but this is not included on any scale in the present plan Instead we have a 21st-century economy and a transport system capable of handling the traffic volumes of the 1970s The government forecasts that about £60bn of its £180bn transport plan will come from the private sector The risk is that even this modest amount will be delayed and reduced Railtrack is in administration Many of the train operating companies are unsure of their future waiting to see if their franchises will be renewed and wanting to know how the government intends to merge franchises Most people would like a more integrated transport policy but we need to begin by understanding the current popularity of the motor vehicle which accounts for 87 per cent of our travel needs Integration means finding ways to tempt the motorist out of the car on to the bus or train The past five years have shown that motorists cannot be taxed and regulated off the road The first task must be to make it easier to commute by bus or train from suburbs to city centres That requires cheap and secure commuter car parks at stations The second task is to boost capacity on the tube railways and buses so there is a good chance of getting a seat with a regular service The third task is to make it easier to drive to the station We need to review station access in each town and city The fourth task is to take urgent decisions to enable the railway industry to attract massive private investment to do the job That means getting Railtrack out of administration as quickly as possible It means proposing a scheme for the tube that would release far more private capital than the convoluted PPP so far devised It means offering long franchises to existing train companies quickly or getting on with supplanting them There is no advantage in insisting on only one company at each station imagine the chaos if Heathrow airport decided it wanted only one airline to fly in It means creating a Londoner's tube owned by London voters and tube travellers which could raise substantial sums from the City to build a new line put air conditioning on the trains and build park-and-ride car parks at outlying stations We also need to increase the capacity of our road network Where new road space is being supplied it could be tolled allowing the money to be raised in the private sector The Dartford crossing showed how successful this approach can be The emphasis should be a little less on management of an inadequate network and much more on attracting large sums into our transport system No one argues over where the money to build new telephone mobile cable and internet networks is going to come from If British Telecommunications were still a nationalised monopoly there would be queues to get a mobile and the internet would be rationed So let us learn the lesson for transport and quickly We need to spend much more than £180bn on transport over the next 10 years but to spend much less than £120bn of taxpayers' money on doing so Setting Railtrack and London Underground free in the private sector would be a good start The telecommunications industry shows how spending can be increased while the cost to the taxpayer is cut Do it for transport and Britain can spend more on the NHS without putting taxes up The writer is MP for Wokingham,3
2002-06-11, Ryanair No thrills no spills Just a simple business model that is sometimes dismissed as too good to be true Yet once again Ryanair's financial predictability has paid off with margins climbing 200 basis points last year to 24 per cent as average fares fell 8 per cent The key is cost Last year the benefits of online booking cut marketing and distribution costs almost in half Those cost benefits are finite Ryanair has now acquired larger planes at low interest rates which will ferry more passengers for almost the same fuel and staff cost and lower interest payments If cost cutting gets harder there is a greater need for increased traffic which may explain Ryanair's raised forecast of 30-35 per cent annual growth Margins may ease to around 20 per cent as Ryanair cuts fares to promote travel but it will still generate more cash than it knows what to do with As long as it is true to its pledge not to misspend the {XEU}900m cashpile its predictability will be anything but boring The market however appears to have overlooked Ryanair amid the recovery of the network majors and the excitement of the EasyJet/Go merger Over the past six months the shares have underperformed European airlines at least until yesterday's rally Yet Ryanair's strong start in Frankfurt Hahn with 80 per cent load factors is a tangible threat to large European airlines With none of EasyJet's complexities Ryanair is still good value despite its premium to the sector ,2
1998-04-02, Dexia the Franco-Belgian banking group made clear yesterday it was still on the acquisition trail despite its decision not to bid for CIC the French bank The group formed by the alliance of Credit Communal de Belgique and Credit Communal de France said it had signed a preliminary agreement to take over the pensions division of SMAP Belgium's leading insurance company in the pension and life sector Francois Narmon chairman of Dexia's Belgian arm said the deal was a step towards creating a bancassurance business in Belgium We are also looking at other acquisitions in Europe he said 1998 will be a year of alliances and acquisitions  The comments came as Dexia reported a 12 9 per cent increase in 1997 net income from BFr19 4bn to BFr21 9bn $574m It also reported an exceptional gain of BFr14 6bn on the sale of its stake in Banque Bruxelles Lambert Belgium's third largest bank taken over by ING of the Netherlands last December Net banking income rose 4 9 per cent from BFr85 03bn to BFr89 2bn reflecting only a modest rise in net interest income from BFr65 3bn to BFr67 2bn The rise was limited by the fact that revenues from the sale of Dexia Belgium shares by Belgian local authorities were used to pay off their loans reducing the bank's outstanding commitments Non-interest income increased 11 5 per cent to BFr21 97bn Earnings per share for the Belgian arm rose from BFr263 8 to BFr294 2 with an 11 1 per cent jump in the dividend proposed to BFr130 Earnings for Dexia France rose from FFr43 3 to FFr48 9 with a gross dividend of FFr25 95 ,1

2002-06-11, The landmark agreement between Island ECN and Instinet the two largest alternative securities markets in the US could not have come at a worse time for Nasdaq For several decades the second largest US stock market has dominated the electronic trading side of US investing It is on the brink of rolling out an important new technology system called SuperMontage and was in talks with Island and Instinet to convince them to participate in the new system rather than go it alone SuperMontage was expected to give Nasdaq a competitive advantage It was also hoped that it would bring old foes together against a common enemy Until yesterday Nasdaq held a clear advantage over the fragmented alternative markets That advantage has narrowed considerably The risk for Nasdaq is that it could lose an increasing share of its electronic liquidity to Instinet Island and others Instinet and Island together account for about 22 per cent of Nasdaq trading liquidity which was less of a problem when Nasdaq was mainly a display facility and not an execution destination Nasdaq was traditionally the screen-based system that market-makers and other traders used to display their orders Nasdaq never provided execution services on its own but relied on others including the electronic communications networks ECNs Its advantage was in its liquidity and it was able to collect huge fees for displaying stock quotes and for printing those quotes once a match was made That model changed several years ago when Nasdaq said it would transform itself into an independent for-profit business which also executed orders on its own system That move set off alarms at the largest ECNs Instinet and Island which became even more panicked when Nasdaq unveiled SuperMontage Some have dubbed SuperMontage an ECN killer because of the speed of its planned executions and certain disadvantages the ECNs would have if they participated By combining Island and Instinet will no doubt have greater sway over their terms with Nasdaq than either could before Moreover executives at the two companies said they were keen on developing the listed side of the business in stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange Island especially has made deep inroads to one area of trading that puts it squarely in competition with the NYSE the trading of exchange traded funds or ETFs baskets of stocks that trade like a single security People are increasingly willing to trade listed stocks with us because of our success with ETFs said Edward Nicoll chairman of Island ECN It remains far too early however to know if Nasdaq or the NYSE will be severely challenged by the combination of Island and Instinet Executives have no clear plan as to how the two trading systems would be combined to the advantage of investors other than the fact that initially the two systems will be linked Island has managed to eclipse Nasdaq and Instinet in recent months because of its low cost strategy In November Island became the largest alternative platform in Nasdaq stock trading for the first time and has held on to that position ever since Island's success has forced both Nasdaq and Instinet to lower and alter their own pricing policies in response All three will have to rethink their strategies as traders respond to the launch of SuperMontage ,2
2002-06-08, An astral theme seems to be recurring in the UK fund management industry First Mercury then Jupiter then New Star and now Neptune have become planetary influences on the names of fund managers How many planets are left for further entrants Robin Geffen one of the UK's best performing managers of small funds who has just set up Neptune admits the shrinking universe of potential names limited the options Maverick had been ruled out as an early contender but Mr Geffen still hopes Neptune will stand out from the crowd exploiting a niche for a small independent player focused on the retail market He says the market needs independents to offer fresh ideas Many of the large houses have grown to the point where the investment style that originally made them successful can no longer be applied he says Neptune has been set up following the withdrawal from the UK market of Orbitex Financial Services the small Zurich-based fund manager where Mr Geffen had run its pooled pension fund At Orbitex he built up a strong track record Over the three years to March 31 the CF Orbitex Balanced Fund performance was ranked first out of 71 similar funds with annual growth rated at 17 7 per cent according to the performance measurement consultancy Russell Mellon CAPS A rival performance measurement consultancy Micropal ranked it first out of 164 similar funds with an increase of 61 8 per cent over the three-year period With that kind of track record Mr Geffen might have been expected to succumb to the lucrative temptations of the hedge fund world which is currently sucking up star managers like a market black hole But Mr Geffen believes there is more potential to set up a traditional long only fund management house At the moment there is a bull market developing in hedge funds with massive capacity building up he says A few years ago you had established managers with at least a strong three- to four-year track record entering the industry Now you are getting a lot of inexperienced managers coming in  They will not be able to deliver the returns that are commensurate with the kind of fees they are charging  Before Orbitex Mr Geffen had been a prominent manager at Eagle Star York Trust and lastly Scottish Equitable where he helped set up its pooled fund business At Scottish Equitable he also set up what he says was the UK's first emerging markets pension fund At Eagle Star Mr Geffen was on the European desk before heading up its Asia Pacific team In 1986 under his direction the Eagle Star Far East Unit Trust was the second best performing authorised unit trust Neptune will have modest beginnings with contracts to manage £30m of assets transferred from Orbitex a tiny amount in the fund management world But Mr Geffen says Neptune's investment style is highly scaleable with the capacity to grow quickly Neptune plans to focus on large capitalisation stocks selected through global sector analysis It will adopt a neutral style rather than focus on growth or value methods of investing Mr Geffen is a believer in active management with concentrated holdings some stocks will account for up 4 to 5 per cent of Neptune's portfolios This entails greater risk but he says this can be minimised through strict investment policies to stop losses and stockpicking skills Mr Geffen says Orbitex had delivered consistent returns although he does admit a blip in the last quarter of 2001 when he under-estimated the strength of the market rally after the September 11 terrorist attacks We had been overly defensive in that quarter he says There is still an old economy bent to Neptune's current portfolio Top 10 holdings of Neptune include Associated British Foods Astra Zeneca BP British American Tobacco Cadbury Schweppes Imperial Tobacco Shell Apache Corp Eni and Devon Energy Mr Geffen says the tobacco stocks are still undervalued in spite of recent gains and should continue to do well with stable earnings and dividend growth Imperial Tobacco had made a rare example of a value-enhancing acquisition with its takeover this year of Reemtsma the German tobacco company even with £1bn rights issue to fund the deal For once a rights issue was welcome he says Mr Geffen says oil stocks should also continue to do well In spite of recent rising inventories in the US demand for oil should remain strong and prices firm amid continued tensions in the Middle East He says one of Orbitex's strongest recent gainers was Enterprise Oil which was taken over by Royal Dutch/ Shell this year in a £3 5bn deal The gains from this stock had been reinvested in Devon and Apache two US oil groups These companies are in the second tier of oil companies in the US where there is a lot mergers and acquisition activity continuing to take place he says On Associated British Foods Mr Geffen believes the owner of British Sugar and Twinings tea should continue to benefit from its restructuring and long-awaited acquisitions to use its cash pile In April the company bought Mazola corn oil and 18 related brands from Unilever for £248m Before that deal it was estimated to have a cash pile of about £900m There are signs of change Mr Geffen says He says stability of the investment team will be a key factor in maintaining performance at Neptune He says the performance of some funds at larger houses had been hit by the current spate of departures of star managers He believes small houses where managers have a stake in the company are more stable Mr Geffen says no exit strategy through a trade sale of Neptune or flotation would be considered for at least five years We are in it for the long term he says ,2

2002-06-01, Rail travellers in the north of England could suffer sporadic strikes until February a rail operator has warned as unions launched fresh strike action today in a pay dispute Arriva Trains Northern said last night it was disappointed and frustrated that travellers were to suffer in another one-day stoppage called by the Rail Maritime and Transport union Ray Price managing director said the 4 per cent pay rise it had offered rail workers 10 days ago was fair and a genuine attempt to resolve the dispute The union rejected our offer despite giving strong indications that it would be acceptable and did not take the opportunity to put it to a vote by its members  The stoppage comes on the first day of the jubilee weekend Arriva which runs a trans-Pennine network said it hoped to provide more than 55 per cent of its services today ensuring that three-quarters of the network was covered The company warned that if there was no resolution it would be faced with the intolerable prospect of strike action continuing until its franchise ran out in February The row centres on union demands that the company close the pay gap between conductors and train drivers  Local government unions yesterday revealed plans to ballot members on a 24-hour strike on July 17 as part of their pay dispute ,3

2002-06-03, It is often an advantage to be Irish in the US But Willie Cotter chief executive of Bank of Ireland Asset Management is the first to admit the limitations of playing the ethnic card in the world's most important investment market In many ways the last thing they Americans would have associated with Ireland was having their money managed there says Mr Cotter speaking at BIAM's Dublin headquarters where a staff of 25 manage a $52bn £35bn global equity portfolio half of which is for US clients BIAM originally a joint venture with two UK merchant banks Schroder Wagg and Morgan Grenfell is now the fifth largest manager of non-US equities for US institutions Last month it announced its first acquisition a $177m £120m deal to buy 61 per cent of Iridian an independent US active investment manager Non-US or international equities make up about 15 per cent of US pension assets As with other foreign providers BIAM has had little luck tapping into the much larger domestic equities market which represents closer to half of all US pension fund assets I don't think it's ever been done says Mr Cotter The only way to go is through acquisition  BIAM looked at hundreds of potential takeover targets over the past five years before deciding on Iridian We're a bit choosy because this industry is known for a distinct lack of success for acquisitions working A lot of acquirers are doing it for the wrong reasons It became a very trendy thing in the 1990s particularly for European banks said Mr Cotter The Iridian deal will double BIAM's client base BIAM currently has about 250 public and corporate pension fund clients while Iridian has some 200 US clients in the foundation and endowment markets Under stock exchange rules Bank of Ireland is not required to publish profit figures for Iridian as the cost of the deal is less than 5 per cent of the bank's market capitalisation At around 3 per cent of assets under management the price paid is in line with similar deals in the industry Mr Cotter is reluctant to make predictions but he does not rule out the possibility that Iridian could soon be a bigger fund manager than BIAM It has been a long hard slog establishing a reputation in the US market We got our first customer in 1990 which was a $1m account says Mr Cotter Pension funds don't hire people quickly They will track you and watch you for years before they hire you  The Irish links were important New York's police and fire departments which have strong Irish affiliations are among BIAM's major clients But Mr Cotter points to a school teachers' retirement fund in California where many teachers were Jewish and the state of Hawaii which doesn't have too many Irish on its board Mr Cotter believes Irish fund managers were uniquely suited to break into the US market Ireland has a tradition of managed pension funds and as players in a small domestic economy Irish fund managers would have had much more international experience than their UK counterparts Mr Cotter says Irish pension funds have about half their assets invested outside Ireland We have always been international investors unlike funds in Britain which didn't really need to look beyond their shores  BIAM's toe in the water in the early 1990s coincided with a change in investment policy by US pension funds with many buying foreign equities for the first time Between 1991 and 1999 US pension funds increased their exposure to international equities from 3 per cent to 14 per cent America is a wonderful country    you can make a very fine living being a niche player says Mr Cotter By buying Iridian we are into a bigger niche  Like Iridian BIAM is an active value manager The bank pursues what it calls a model approach to investment all clients receiving the same product and the same investment advice Mr Cotter says BIAM is fairly conservative in picking stocks favouring well established companies over fast growth performers His team of investment managers targets companies that drive return on equity and year after year add to shareholders' funds In the financial sector he says BIAM favours the UK banks because of their strong dividend yield and the fact they have been active consolidators in their home market Mr Cotter says We focus on companies that have a healthy balance sheet strong cash flow and a good dividend history Needless to say having a strong management is also essential ,1
2002-04-18, From the enthusiasm of the thousands of flagwaving government supporters packed into the main square in Gyor it would be easy to forget who is ahead in Hungary's election campaign They seem barely aware that the centre-right Fidesz party is trailing after the first round When Viktor Orban prime minister starts speaking it is obvious where their inspiration comes from Only two weeks ago Mr Orban seemed assured of easy re-election now he is fighting for his political life The message is simple and reflects real panic on the Hungarian right that having taken a first-round election lead the opposition Socialists might take power after Sunday's second decisive vote There are situations in a person's life when there are one or two possible options ahead Mr Orban tells the crowd There are two roads and we have to decide which we are going to take  The government needs votes Please remember everybody should bring along a friend Mr Orban says in a refrain now so familiar that the crowd say it with him The rally reflects a sharp change in tactic for Mr Orban and Fidesz his centre-right party since their surprise first-round defeat on April 7 Having run a slick media-oriented campaign before the first round the party is now concentrating on big shows of strength On April 9 thousands of Fidesz supporters blocked streets in suburban Buda to hear a speech by Mr Orban On Saturday several hundred thousand Fidesz supporters though the party claims up to 2m rallied outside parliament At Gyor in deference perhaps to the presence of Helmut Kohl the former German chancellor Mr Orban misses out his customary criticism of big business He normally says that big taken to mean foreign capital would run the country under the Socialists Mr Orban does remind his listeners however about the miseries of the Socialists' 1995 austerity package to which many economists attribute the country's present growing prosperity He also repeatedly mentions the low level of pensions under the Socialists Fidesz's tactics are based on the idea that the party's first-round defeat was down to the failure of rightwing voters to get to the ballot box In particular Mr Orban has appealed for supporters of the agrarian Smallholders' party which collapsed amid scandals two years ago to turn out on Sunday The electoral arithmetic however looks forbidding Since a record 71 per cent of the electorate took part first time round the room for a higher turnout looks limited The Socialists and the liberal Free Democrats have also withdrawn competing candidates in the second round to unite the anti-government vote and the new centrist Centrum party has also withdrawn most of its remaining candidates The combined anti-government forces had more first-round votes than the combined rightwing forces in more than 100 of the 131 seats to be decided in the second round Fidesz consequently may struggle to win even the 56 still-contested seats where it took first place on April 7 The anti-government parties meanwhile are delighted with Mr Orban's new tactics believing they have banished the complacency that might have overcome their supporters ,3
1998-04-01, Substantial cost-cutting and improved efficiency lifted pre-tax profits at Maruti India's biggest carmaker 20 per cent to Rs9 76bn $247m for the year ended yesterday The results which compared with Rs8 08bn the previous year were achieved despite a modest rise in car sales of 7 7 per cent Maruti a 5050 joint venture between the Indian government and Suzuki the Japanese carmaker maintained a share of more than 80 per cent of India's passenger car market with unit sales of 326840 against 303525 a year earlier despite growing competition from newly arrived foreign and joint-venture carmakers R S S L N Bhaskarudu the managing director whose appointment last year caused a bitter dispute with Suzuki refused to comment on the continuing dispute which is the subject of arbitration proceedings in Paris Suzuki opposed Mr Bhaskarudu's appointment saying he was unsuitable for the post He would say only that a solution to the dispute lay in the hands of Maruti's owners The company's basic 800cc model remained the mainstay of production with output of 189000 cars Falling output of its 1000cc and Esteem models down almost 25 per cent at 18700 units was offset by rising sales of both the 800cc and its Omni minivan up 21 per cent Mr Bhaskarudu said the sustained profits growth nearly matching the previous year's 22 per cent rise resulted largely from cost-cutting at Maruti's Gurgaon plant outside New Delhi with savings of at least Rs750m coming from cuts suggested by workers Exports mainly of the Suzuki-branded Alto model fell to 25986 cars from 36000 a year earlier but Mr Bhaskarudu said the company aimed to export 10 per cent of production next year The company said export earnings fell to $120m from $140m a year earlier and were exceeded last year by foreign exchange outgoings of $185m Turnover was Rs84 5bn up 6 3 per cent ,2

2002-04-04, It was another uninspiring day for London stocks with Wall Street's latest poor showing both overnight and yesterday continuing to cast a shadow over European markets All the main UK indices lost further ground although dealers said the downside pressures on the market were never substantial It's very quiet Lots of people have taken extended Easter holidays and there are still a lot of empty seats around the place said one trader It will take a while for the market to crank up to full speed he said The FTSE 100 ended a session highlighted by investor indecision and a general lack of enthusiasm with a marginal 3 6 decline at 5247 8 having been as high as 5268 4 and as low as 5235 4 As for the other leading indices it was bad news with the FTSE 250 closing 19 2 off at 6178 9 after a low of 6178 6 and the FTSE SmallCap down 2 56 at 2547 81 In percentage terms however it was the Techmark 100 that took the heaviest punishment sliding 18 2 or 1 5 per cent to 1177 8 its lowest level since October 3 Wall Street's problems stemmed once again from profit warnings many of them in the tech sector slightly disappointing economic data and the continuing concerns about events in the Middle East Among the factors behind a mid-afternoon dip in markets was news that Egypt had adopted a much colder relationship in government- to-government relations with Israel after recent events The economic news also unsettling sentiment in the markets was a slide in the US ISM's index of non-manufacturing in March On Tuesday evening the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 48 points while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite took a much heavier blow sliding 58 points or over 3 per cent to its lowest level since the beginning of March And there were more problems for Wall Street yesterday as the Dow lost over 90 points not long after London closed and the Nasdaq fell back below the 18000 level It was a quiet day for company news and for economic data The latest Halifax UK house prices survey showed prices rose by 0 4 per cent in March much slower than February's 1 5 per cent That news was greeted by those concerned with the view that a rampant housing market would hasten a rise in domestic interest rates in the near future Meanwhile the market expects the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to leave interest rates unchanged when it announces its decision at midday That news will be followed by the European Central Bank's decision on eurozone interest rates which are also expected to be left on hold Among the winners and losers there was a definite old economy/new economy bias with the new stocks taking punishment and providing the majority of the losers in the top 100 index Turnover in equities fell just short of 2bn shares ,2
2002-04-09, Elections may be a year away but voter registration begins soon and it's there that the first contest in Nigerian politics traditionally begins If the right sum of money is placed in the right hands the number of constituents in a ward can be shifted up or down says one aspiring senator of his area A whole industry of what he calls grass roots political consultants are on hand to prepare other advantages including control of ballot boxes on polling day Whether they can see it or not from Abuja it is happening The electoral commission is recruiting officials now for voter registration so politicians are starting to put in place their rigging mechanisms he explains Nigeria has been down this road before Both previous attempts at civilian rule in the 1960s and 1980s were cut short by the military following chaotic elections mismanaged by incumbent civilians This time few Nigerians have forgotten or forgiven the military for the role it played in their country's decay But from the arid north to the swamps of the oil-producing Niger Delta disappointment in civilian rule is running deep Disputes between the executive and the legislature and the presidency and state governors even when they are from the same party are paralysing policymaking Pursuit of office often appears more important than what to do once there It is not that people don't want democracy and they wouldn't choose to have the military back It's just that so much energy is being dissipated on nothing laments one National Assembly member Unless there is a dramatic turnaround general elections scheduled for March 2003 will take place in the context of a virtual one party state The People's Democratic party PDP controls the Senate the House of Representatives and 21 of 36 state governments Both parties in opposition the All People's party and the Alliance for Democracy are in disarray The fate of new political parties is in the hands of the National Assembly If allowed to contest they would have little time to mount an effective challenge My projection is that if we go on this way we will not have an election result that is easily acceptable to the populace says the same National Assembly member Despite widespread concern about the consequences little is being done as yet to create an electoral system less open to abuse If we continue to believe that only rigged elections are won our democracy will lack the fundamental foundations of legitimacy President Obasanjo warned recently Our nation is in danger of being caught in a vicious circle where only those who have no respect for our laws will find their way into making laws for us and determining how we live our lives he added Only weeks before this warning the presidency itself had tinkered with the electoral law in a bid to restrict the contest to existing parties put together hurriedly in the dying days of military rule This and the sudden replacement of 34 state electoral commissioners has heightened fears that factions within the ruling PDP are determined to press home their incumbency advantage at all costs The sums required to contest for office have raised the stakes in the power struggles at state and local levels Both between parties and within the ruling PDP these are triggering riots bomb plots and murder in many southern states As elections loom President Obasanjo faces as hard a choice as anyone He has already had more than his fair share of crises to manage The religious violence between Christians and Muslims sparked by the spreading imposition of Islamic Sharia law in the north has been among the worst Perhaps inevitably in Nigeria's divided context he is perceived in the north and south-east to have favoured his own Yoruba group from the south-west Meanwhile his reputation at home for arrogance was cemented by a spectacular blunder in the commercial capital Lagos in January Live on television he told an emotional crowd freshly depossessed by the explosion of an army weapons dump to shut up He was apparently unaware that nearby more than 1000 people had died and that locally the event was being likened to Nigeria's September 11 Among supporters who in 1999 saw Mr Obasanjo as a safe pair of hands there are some who argue that the best thing now would be for him to stand down By levelling the playing field or at worst giving all parties an equal opportunity to rig he could play a similar refereeing role to the military suggests a colleague of old from the north But if he is seen to hand his candidacy now to Atiku Abubakar the northern vice-president he risks being accused by fellow Yorubas of cutting their long-awaited turn at the presidency short Another perceived dilemma is the lack of alternatives with the requisite stature So far only a succession of mavericks have openly declared an interest in running against him Posters appearing across Nigeria featuring Ibrahim Babangida at the head of the Association for Sustainable Democracy and Good Governance signal that the former military ruler of legendary wealth and influence may have more than a passing interest too Whether he decides to stand or not Mr Babangida under whose rule corruption thrived and in 1993 democracy was aborted is bound to play a decisive powerbroking role in coming months The hope is that the outcome will not be too divisive and that the next government will be forced to take stock and start repairs But if Nigerians are united now it is in the fear that some sort of collision is becoming inevitable It may be that the convergence of religious ethnic and economic crises and the recalcitrance of a political old guard that has contributed so much to cause all three has made overhauling the system overwhelming ,3

2002-04-20, The increases in NI contributions are unwelcome but could have been much tougher says Kate Burgess Whichever way you lookat it GordonBrown has raised the tax rate for most individuals by 1 per cent to pay for spending on the National Health Service Both employees and employers will pay 1 per cent extra in national insurance NI contributions a tax by most people's reckoning which was introduced in 1911 to pay for medical expenses It is a compulsory levy on both employees and employers The new rules come in next year starting in April What it means is that anyone earning between £4615 and £30940 in 2003-04 will pay an extra 1 per cent in NI on top of the 10 per cent rate due in 2002-03 The government has also introduced another layer of tax to catch higher earners For the first time they will pay 1 per cent on earnings above what the government had previously deemed an upper earnings limit on contributions The threshold will be £30940 in 2003-04 The changes mean that anyone earning £100000 will pay an extra £900 a year say tax experts while those earning £35000 will be £304 worse off from April 2003 onwards High City earners garnering £2m in annual income will pay £18000 more Top rate earners will breathe a sigh of relief Many were expecting Brown to abolish the upper earnings limit and levy a flat rate of NI on all earnings above £4615 at say 10 per cent That would have meant those earning for example £100000 a year would have had to stump up an extra £7000 a year It's politically clever says Simon Philip partner at Andersen Private Client Services One per cent is inoffensive  If this limit had been abolished individuals might have had to pay 11 per cent on all earnings That would have hit wealthy consumers' discretionary spending says Philip NI contributions entitle taxpayers to the state pension and a number of benefits such as the Jobseeker's Allowance This is the first rise in direct taxes since Labour came to power and isn't that onerous says Eleanor Dowling senior tax consultant at Mercer Human Resource Consulting The chancellor has insulated moderate earners and working families with joint incomes under £58000 through the new child tax credit  The lower earnings threshold for NI contributions is currently £4615 This lower limit has been frozen for 2003-04 The upper earnings limit will increase from £30420 to £30940 in 2003-04 which is in line with inflation The self-employed pay a different rate of NI They pay a flat £2 a week and anyone making more than £4615 a year will pay 7 per cent on earnings up to £30420 in 2002-3 From April 2003 they will pay 8 per cent on their profits between £4615 and £30940 and an extra 1 per cent on anything they make above that Individuals who have let their NI contributions lapse as a result say of not working can voluntarily pay Class 3 NI contributions of £6 85 per week ,2

2002-06-20, Benpres Holdings a leading Philippine conglomerate has failed to make two interest payments due this week endangering the fundraising efforts of a water utility In a statement to regulators Benpres which owns the country's biggest electricity retailer and largest television broadcaster said it failed to pay interest due yesterday on $150m euro notes and payments due on Monday of 2bn pesos of long-term commercial paper Left vulnerable is Maynilad Water Services a joint venture with Ondeo the French water operator which is negotiating a $350m loan from multilateral lending agencies and international banks The loan which was expected to be approved next month will finance expansion and rehabilitation projects Benpres did not reveal the size of its missed payments However the eurobonds carried a coupon rate of 7 875 per cent payable twice a year indicating that $5 9m interest was due yesterday The local commercial papers had interest of 5 817 per cent payable quarterly suggesting a 29m peso interest payment The missed payments are likely to affect the ability of Benpres subsidiaries to raise money to fund projects Creditors would be worried about the parent company's capacity to guarantee its subsidiaries' debt They will remember this for a long time said Jose Vistan economist at AB Capital and Investment a Manila investment bank Benpres is in talks with creditors to restructure outstanding loans of $597m about $200m of which are maturing this year It has appointed Credit Suisse First Boston as financial adviser It also plans to cut debt by selling non-core assets valued at $200m ,2
2002-06-01, Philip Morris Philip Morris has finally unloaded Miller to South African Breweries at what looks like a very acceptable price True at 9 4 times earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation the multiple lags behind that of recent deals But Miller's is a pretty flat beer franchise and it certainly appears that Interbrew overpaid for Beck's Philip Morris will maintain a 36 per cent stake in the combined SAB Miller and says it might possibly increase the stake in 2005 when the terms of the agreement allow More likely it is keeping up appearances The structure of the deal is clever both for legal and tax reasons Philip Morris is merging the assets into SAB maintaining a stake worth $3bn and taking a $2bn dividend that it will use to move cash out of the corporate entity subject to tobacco litigation Because the book value of the assets is less than the value of the stake in SAB Miller it retains it can claim not to be selling assets in order to buy back shares without blushing too much Because it is only receiving $2bn in the form of cash the tax bill on the $5 6bn transaction is only $300m Assuming that Philip Morris is not serious about increasing its stake it will eventually spin off the SAB Miller shares to its shareholders Over time legal issues permitting the 84 per cent stake in Kraft Foods will go the same way For now the litigation risk surrounding the tobacco business means that Philip Morris is unlikely to trade much above the current ratio of 11{1/2} times forward earnings roughly a 50 per cent discount to the market despite double digit earnings growth and prodigious cash generation Yet adding the $1 7bn of cash received to its existing share buyback programme and $5bn dividend means that this year Philip Morris will return more than $11bn to shareholders The dividend yield of 4 1 per cent is attractive and there is ample compensation for the litigation risk By the end of 2006 Merrill Lynch analysts estimate that Philip Morris will have returned some $60bn to shareholders That is equal to half the current market capitalisation ,1
2002-04-25, Investors continued to snap up new municipal bond issues yesterday digesting a $504m offering from Georgia The sale was the latest in a string of successful deals including a $500m healthcare revenue bond from Kaiser Permanente California priced on Tuesday as well as a$335m offering from Connecticut that sold easily even after the state revealed that it expected its deficit to double in 2002 As we move out of March and April into May and June we would expect issuance to pick up some because the patterns in our market are seasonal said Philip Fischer a director at Merrill Lynch Next month investors will be offered the third largest muni deal ever $3bn in bonds from the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority But demand seems to be keeping up with supply The bonds which are tax-free for in-state investors gained favour as a haven investment through the stock market downturn Even now with analysts predicting an economic recovery investors' fears about Enronesque corporate blow-ups have kept them in munis Mr Fischer said States and localities are generally quite good credits some of them triple A and our investor base remains really risk averse he said Caution has paid off Municipal bonds have returned 2 21 per cent since the end of 2001 compared with a total return of 0 74 per cent for corporate bonds and a 4 per cent loss excluding dividends for the S&P 500 Most states and localities have maintained their credit ratings through the recession and investors including insurance companies and mutual funds as well as retail buyers beefed up their municipal bond holdings as a result The September 11 claims which the property and casualty companies insured were not as costly as we had originally feared so they didn't have to liquidate their bonds and they became more profitable because they could increase rates Mr Fischer said Meanwhile an ageing retail population seized on less risky income-producing securities and muni bond mutual funds saw dramatic inflows Nuveen and Blackrock responded to the demand by opening 15 new funds between them in just one week last month Arbitrageurs are also moving into the market betting on movements in the spreads between different muni bonds or between muni bonds and other fixed-income securities Mr Fischer said Different investors prefer different deal structures but Merrill Lynch has noticed a sharp upswing in demand for bonds with 15-year maturities and 5 5 per cent coupons The muni bond yield curve has been volatile in recent months due to changing expectations about the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy But that's the sweet spot Mr Fischer said That's where the risk and return gets really maximised  The size of the New York deal and new economic data releases may put pressure on municipal prices in coming weeks According to Dow Jones several brokers are advising investors to bargain hunt selling old New York debt for example to buy new bonds at lower prices ,2
2002-06-12, Bertelsmann is to acquire Zomba the music company behind Britney Spears for almost $3bn £2bn in a move that will strengthen the German media group's music business but will restrict its ability to make other acquisitions The news is likely to damp expectations that Bertelsmann could be preparing a bid for television assets in the UK and further music or magazine acquisitions in the US Zomba and BMG Bertelsmann's music business have had ties since the mid-1980s Zomba founded by music producer Clive Calder has been Bertelsmann's best source of talent in recent years contributing acts such as Britney Spears and N'Sync to BMG's roster In 1991 Bertelsmann acquired a 25 per cent stake in Zomba's music publishing division and in 1996 it bought 20 per cent of its record division In ajoint statement with Bertelsmann Zomba said yesterday it had exercised a put option forcing BMG to acquire the shares it does not own in the business Thomas Middelhoff Bertelsmann's chief executive has been in talks with Mr Calder for months about the option but neither of the companies would say what role if any Mr Calder would now play at BMG Bertelsmann declined to comment on the deal yesterday citing the ongoing legal and regulatory process involved But in its latest annual report the group said the option which was due to expire at the end of this year was worth about $3bn The option was based on a multiple of eight to 12 times Zomba's annual profits between 1999 and 2001 The company is believed to have profits of about $300m on sales of $1bn The transaction will increase the profitability of BMG which has suffered from poor demand and is in the middle of restructuring The fourth biggest of the five music majors BMG made a net loss of {XEU}43m in the six months to December 2001 on sales of {XEU}1 6bn The deal will stretch the finances of Bertelsmann which said last week it would soon issue a {XEU}1bn bond its first benchmark-sized debt issue The group is expected to have net debt of about {XEU}4bn £2 6bn by year-end Ratings agencies have said Bertelsmann's BBB+ credit rating or equivalent could only be maintained through disposals should the option be exercised www ft com/media,1

2002-06-07, Motorists are unlikely to see large increases in the cost of their car insurance this year as insurers begin to make profits on motor policy underwriting according to a study by Datamonitor the independent market analyst It found that car insurance rates were likely to remain at about 2001 levels as underwriting profits return The insurance industry last made an underwriting profit from motor insurance in 1994 and according to the Association of British Insurers made losses totalling £916m in 2000 Datamonitor says that drivers have seen the cost of comprehensive cover in-crease by 53 per cent during the past three years Motorists paying for non-comprehensive cover have seen their premiums rise 78 per cent during the same period Premiums have increased because of the rise of the no-win no-fee compensation culture which has led to more claims The latest figures show that numbers of claims rose by 5 6 per cent to 2 9m Insurers have also been affected by changes for personal injury compensation awards as calculated under the so-called Ogden Tables Liz Hartley financial services analyst at Data-monitor said that insurers had become more focused on underwriting performance and had moved out of areas of unprofitable or risky business In the 1990s motor insurers were cutting premiums to win new business Ms Hartley said Now they are less concerned about chasing volumes and instead are being far more selective about the motorists and cars they insure  In 2000 premium income soared to record levels of £7 8bn up by 9 per cent on the previous year www datamonitor com,2
2002-04-13, NTL the cable company crippled by $17bn £11 9bn debt was last night again locked in crunch talks about the future shape of the company and its management with the committee that represents the main bondholders expected to gain control Despite calls from minority bondholders to sack NTL executives the committe representing the funds that hold most of NTL's $11bn in bonds is keeping its powder dry ahead of any agreement The funds will be left with the biggest share of NTL equity command of its board and its short-term funding supply under the terms of a debt for equity swap still being hammered out Negotiators described an outline deal as imminent But they warned it could still take time for details to be signed by the bondholder committee and NTL's lending banks The lending banks include a UK working group of banks and one which has lent to Cablecom NTL's Swiss subsidiary They are understood to be supportive of the current management and its performance during the restructuring A deal would need to be backed by a sufficient number of smaller bondholders many of which want Barclay Knapp NTL chief executive and John Gregg its finance director to go While generally supportive of current NTL management some committee funds are prepared to make changes to win concessions One bondholder said We will do whatever it takes to maximise the value of the asset whether it means getting rid of one two or any other number of management That doesn't mean it will happen on day one  Committee funds rejected suggestions by sources close to Liberty Media the investment company led by John Malone the US cable tycoon that they have been sweet-talked into accepting restructuring terms overly favourable to NTL's current management Liberty Media made its own $2bn restructuring offer to NTL management which was rejected by Knapp and his team Another bondholder said If anyone thinks we have been persuaded by charismatic Barclay Knapp to sign up for something we are not happy with I would respectfully comment they are on the wrong page  One person close to the situation said When bondholders own the company these decisions will be theirs to take It wont't be for the management to save their jobs  NTL decline to comment yesterday ,2
2002-06-28, In all the coverage of Gordon Brown's Mansion House speech on Wednesday night it went largely unnoticed that he had in effect declared that one of the five tests for euro entry had been passed Mr Brown referred his audience of bankers to the Treasury's 1997 assessment of the fourth test the effect on financial services which concluded the benefits and the opportunities from the single currency will probably be easier to tap from within the eurozone He added We reaffirm that the decision on EMU must ensure that the UK remains an attractive location for financial services  That test for just about everyone not in the Mansion House at the time is the least important In the wealth of detail Mr Brown provided about the preliminary and technical work now under way at the Treasury which to all intents and purposes is equivalent to the assessment itself there were plenty of other questions with less clear-cut answers But many of the issues he raised do at least allow the government the possibility of beginning to make the economic case for euro entry On flexibility for example the British economy's recent record in coping with shocks seems to suggest the labour market has been working well The world economy has been through a severe slowdown but unemployment has barely risen and inflation has stayed low Mr Brown's emphasis on inward investment puts the spotlight on the figures showing that Britain has remained the most favoured location in Europe but its lead appears to have been slipping The strength of the pound and the decision not to join the euro from the beginning may have had some effect The fifth test that sums up the rest and looks at the effect on employment was also described by Mr Brown in ways that could show entry into monetary union in a positive light The Treasury is looking at the likely impact of EMU on trade which seems certain to be positive though there is a debate among economists about the size of the effect The lessons from the US the subject of another Treasury study will surely show that monetary union has been good for the US No one seriously believes it should go back to having separate regional currencies Other questions are more ambiguous Investigation of the housing market will reveal significant structural differences between Britain and the eurozone Many eurozone countries have equally high or even higher levels of owner-occupation but in most of them mortgage borrowing is generally at fixed rates and on a smaller scale than in Britain Another issue under examination is the EU's stability and growth pact which has been often criticised by Mr Brown although there have been signs that a further reinterpretation is now on the agenda Perhaps the most difficult question will be the determination of a sustainable exchange rate for entry The consequences of getting it wrong would be severe an inflationary boom or an export sector condemned to a long-term lack of competitiveness And economists cannot agree on what is the right rate The Confederation of British Industry's upper limit of a rate of £0 67 to the euro is a level that many of its members would still find unacceptable ,3
2002-04-18, The market was in recovery mode after yesterday's Budget looking for earnings growth and punishing consumer related-companies with high payrolls because of the increased national insurance contribution BT one of the most liquid stocks in the UK market rallied 8{1/2} to 272{1/4}p on heavy volume as investors looked for a way into recovery-related technology media and telecom stocks The shares had slid fairly gracefully from a peak above £10 a couple of years ago to a low of 215p in late February The move was helped by Deutsche Bank which added BT to its Focus List of recommended stocks and stressed its 307p price target The broker said its forecasts were at the conservative end of management's targets for all the key metrics and our valuation is unaggressive Deutsche's recommended list is biased towards an upturn particularly in the telecom sector its three strongest buys are MMO{2} Signet and Vodafone It also likes BSkyB which was the best performer in the FTSE 100 yesterday with a rise of 28{1/2} to 812{1/2}p Meanwhile retailers and related stocks were out of favour yesterday in anticipation that a tax rise would defuse the consumer boom Analysts also pointed out that many high street names were also the county's biggest employers and would suffer from the increased tax burden For example Tesco employs 150000 and Sainsbury's 112000 while GlaxoSmithKline the UK's second largest quoted company only employs 108000 Tesco fell 2 to 258p and Sainsbury 4 to 403p while the main three fallers in the Footsie were all high street stalwarts Kingfisher fell 18{1/2} to 388p Dixons 7{3/4} to 242{1/4}p and GUS 17 to 657p Pressure on Dixons Dixons was under additional pressure from Credit Suisse First Boston which downgraded its stance on the electronics retailer on valuation grounds to hold from buy on a target of 270p It said Dixons would be affected by a declining games and PC market In the FTSE 250 retailer WH Smith was hard-hit after a disappointing half-year performance from its US Travel Retail business and lower-than-expected UK retail profits Analysts said that in spite of a robust sales performance profits at the core UK retail business came in below expectations ABN Amro retained its buy recommendation but reduced full-year profits forecast by £8m to £120m and its forecast for the following year by £12 5m Williams de Broe reiterated its sell stance Debenhams dropped 15{1/4} to 387{3/4}p with Morgan Stanley throwing in some bearish comments and cutting its price target to 400p from 430p after uninspiring first-half figures from the chain The broker said it saw no positive catalysts earnings were at risk from a potential fall in like-for-like sales growth and Debenhams' share price reflects low growth prospects The same picture was seen in the food sectors Safeway fell 4 to 301p following its fourth-quarter trading statement with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney among the first to issue a price target cut Reiterating its neutral stance Schroders' reduced its price target to 310p from 340p citing the likely increase in competition in the industry this year and Safeways' current cash outflow due to new site acquisitions and store expansions Associated British Foods slipped 9 to 526p in spite of first-half results at the top end of analysts' expectations AB Foods' profit rose 6 per cent to £192m ahead of house broker ABN Amro's estimate of £186m which encouraged it to upgrade the company to buy from add WestLB Panmure raised its full-year forecast to £410m from £402m after the figures One dealer pointed out that after the clawback effect from falling interest rates on the company's huge cash pile underlying earnings were up 13 per cent GlaxoSmithKline bucked the effects of an earlier downgrade out of the US as the chancellor gave the drugs group slightly more than expected The shares rose 12 to £16 32 R&D boost for Glaxo Gordon Brown announced a 25 per cent tax credit for research and development Glaxo the UK's largest pharmaceuticals group which accounts for about 17 per cent of the total UK spend on R&D was estimated to be able to gain £68m a year up from earlier estimates of about £50m The presure came from Banc of America which cut its ratings on Eli Lilly of the US and Glaxo on ongoing concerns about their earnings prospects for 2002 The broker moved Glaxo to market performer from buy and its price target to £18 30 from £20 It said although the group traded at a discount to its European peers that was not a reason to buy the stock Rather than offering a buying opportunity we believe a substantial discount is increasingly warranted given the downside risk of deteriorating prospects for near-term earnings growth mainly due to patent concerns it said Imperial Tobacco was predictably one of the Budget losers in reaction to a 6p rise in the price of a packet of cigarettes The shares fell 16{1/2} to 950p Small brewers benefited from the Budget news that duty would be halved by this summer in time for the World Cup Wolverhampton & Dudley added 6 at 718{1/2}p and Greene King 7{1/2} to 815p The oil majors dropped as Mr Brown announced an additional 10 per cent tax on profits from North Sea oilfields BP fell 7 to 598p and Shell Transport 8 to 507p Emap added 2 at 819p after Goldman Sachs upgraded its recommendation on the stock to market outperformer

offered investors attractive fundamentals at a good price given its high quality cash generative businesses Innovation the insurance software provider led the FTSE 250 share risers after announcing $23m of contracts and an agreement to buy the intellectual property rights of InterX Technology's software for up to £8 3m However Torsten Schellscheidt of WestLB Panmure said the acquisition seemed quite expensive given that InterX Technology's parent company had turnover of less than £500000 in the last quarter of 2001 The stock which fell 71{1/2}p in March following the company's move to US

2002-04-18, New Labour Old Labour who knows any more While Tony Blair makes common cause with rightwing leaders in Italy Spain and the US Gordon Brown has unveiled a Budget that should have the ghost of Aneurin Bevan dancing with delight Imagine if Mr Blair had said on the eve of the 1997 election We will double National Health Service expenditure in real terms within a decade In our first term we will raise taxes by stealth In our second we will raise annual taxes openly by £8bn within three years to secure the future of public services  This by any standard was an Old Labour Budget even if it was New Labour fiscal discipline that made it possible I have always said that our prudence was for a purpose said the chancellor His aides insist the strategy is consistent with the principles Mr Brown set out while shadow chancellor in 1993 after the debacle over the 1992 election defeat that taxes would only be raised for a purpose and the purpose to which they would be dedicated would be clear It is risky nonetheless It's a gamble said one minister People will pay a bit extra on taxes to get better services but if they don't see those delivered by the next election there will be a price to pay  It is even more of a gamble because it requires Middle Britain to pay more As Iain Duncan Smith the Conservative leader pointed out a nurse consultant earning £34000 a year would be £24 worse a week off and a police inspector on £37000 would be £27 worse off The child tax credit and working tax credit ease the pain for the lower paid and for some middle-income families with children The freeze on petrol duty also helps the middle classes Mr Blair said I am 100 per cent confident that this Budget goes with the grain of what the British people want us to do more support for families and enterprise and investment in the NHS tied to reform How it will be paid for is all clearly signalled  It is hard to avoid the conclusion though that Mr Brown has found a devious way round Labour's manifesto commitment not to raise income tax His 1 per cent addition to national insurance going right up the income scale taxes most earners in a similar way It was not something Mr Blair or Mr Brown forewarned the voters of at last year's general election The chancellor has also put New Labour's pro-business credentials seriously at risk by raising employers' national insurance by £3 9bn in 2003-04 and £4 1bn in 2004-05 albeit offset by corporation tax cuts for small companies and a research and development tax credit for big ones Michael Jacobs general secretary of the Fabian Society the venerable Labour think-tank said This is a seminal moment for British politics There is now clear red water between Labour committed to a tax-funded universal NHS with European levels of spending and the Tories now committed to dismantling it The death of ideological conflict has clearly been exaggerated The government's social democratic credentials so long questioned cannot now be in doubt  By setting out spending increases until 2008 Mr Brown has laid down the gauntlet to the Tories Mr Duncan Smith refused to commit himself to match the £100bn in annual health spending The Conservative leader is planning a gamble of his own that the public will break with tradition and back alternatives to the tax- funded NHS The price of all this is that Mr Blair's Labour government is harder to define than ever That is in the nature of power and the accretion of apparently contradictory decisions The public will not care as long as hospitals and schools are better ,3
2002-04-15, Long before dotcom companies made profitability a perpetual work-in-progress for the following year there was Star TV The pan-Asian broadcaster acquired by Rupert Murdoch in 1993 for a hefty US$950m was often believed to be on the verge of profitability but it never happened In the meantime costly shifts of strategy accumulated losses and additional investments along the way made that initial bet swell to $2bn So when Mr Murdoch's younger son James arrived in Hong Kong to take charge in the summer of 2000 and predicted that Star would be profitable in a couple of years the sceptics scarcely bothered to raise an eyebrow The younger Mr Murdoch argued that Star's transformation from an English language free-to-air broadcaster that ran old American serials such as Dynasty and Baywatch in 1993 to what is today a media group with 300m viewers offering 39 channels in eight languages had not been given the credit it was due Last week Star was finally out of the red At a media conference in New York the company disclosed that it had made an operating profit of $2 4m in the third quarter of its fiscal year ending June 2002 on revenues of $120m against a quarterly loss of $10 7m a year earlier Vivek Couto an analyst with Media Partners Asia says Star's focus on local programming has begun to pay dividends along with Mr Murdoch's ability to delegate to a team of able lieutenants Star had a history of screwing up in Asia but since Murdoch took over they haven't made many mistakes he says In an interview last week Mr Murdoch attributed the turnaround at Star to being focused You look at what you can afford and that really dictates what you are going to invest You just can't do 10 new things at one time he said One of Star's first moves after Mr Murdoch took over two years ago was to scrap a pay-TV joint venture in Hong Kong a strategy that now looks prescient as more companies have pulled out after deciding the market is far too small Instead Star has focused on the two big markets in the region India and China Since Star withdrew from a dysfunctional joint venture with Zee Telefilms in India in 1999 it has not looked back It scored a runaway success with an Indian remake of the quiz show Who Wants to be a Millionaire launched in July 2000 and followed with popular serials in Hindi centred on for instance the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship Lagging behind Zee and Sony in June 2000 it is now well ahead of both its competitors' channels Last month Star put to work in China some of the lessons it has learned in India which is estimated to account for about 55 per cent of its revenues in Asia Star launched a Mandarin language channel on March 28 with similarly light entertainment offerings such as a courtroom drama before a real judge and a crime show produced in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Security called Wanted! In China The channel called Xing Kong Wei Shi which means Starry Sky Satellite TV is aimed at China's growing band of yuppies The million-dollar question of course is whether rolling out a 24-hour Mandarin Channel in China will push Star back into red Mr Murdoch is emphatic that it will not be a black hole in terms of investment Star is keeping a lid on costs by concentrating on prime-time programming delivered at low cost Media Partners' Mr Couto estimates that an episode of a serial made in China costs as little as $5000 in China compared with $7000 in India Raking in the advertising will be harder than in India but Jamie Davis Star's head in China and an accountant by training says he expects the channel to break even in three years If Star can keep the profits coming quarter after quarter it will be one of a handful of multinationals that invested in China and India in the past 10 years and has profits to show for it Mr Couto predicts however that the progress in China will be incremental at best Star's current high share of TV advertising spending in India meanwhile may be as good as it gets especially as Zee and Sony aggressively roll out new offerings The real money will come if Star can boost cashflow by getting a larger share of some $1bn in subscription revenues in India Mr Couto estimates broadcasters get just 7 per cent of subscribers' fees in India against about 35 per cent that cable broadcasters receive in the US Given the fragmented and relatively lawless state of India's cable sub-operators this is a very tall order Having patiently followed the rainbow to prove there is money to be made in a pan-Asian media business Star may discover that the opportunity is not as big as it thought it was ,2
2002-04-17, Pernod Ricard the French drinks group will seek compensation from Vivendi Universal for allegedly overstocking Chivas Regal scotch whisky and Martell cognac the two main brands that Pernod acquired as part of the carving up of Seagram's drinks portfolio Patrick Ricard chairman said his company had found 750000 excess litres of Chivas Regal and 450000 litres of Martel when it took control last December Mr Ricard said Vivendi Universal had inflated the value of the brands by jamming the distribution channels something which wasn't good practice even if not uncommon in the industry It deserves some compensation and we will complain Mr Ricard added Pernod acquired Seagram's drinks business in an $8 15bn joint bid with Diageo in December 2000 a deal that helped reshape the global drinks industry The transaction allowed Pernod to leapfrog from fifth to third behind Diageo and Allied Domecq However the takeover only became effective a year later because of antitrust obstacles Mr Ricard said the regulatory delay combined with the fact that terms had been agreed with Vivendi on the basis of 2000 results meant that we discovered what we in fact bought only at the start of 2002 However he insisted the deal still represented a cheap opportunity for Pernod to add and revamp global brands that had been somewhat neg- lected by our predecessors High stocks have recently reduced sales volumes for both Chivas Regal and Martell as retailers slowed new purchases In the first quarter Chivas Regal volumes fell 15 per cent while Martell dropped 18 per cent Pernod shares fell 3 5 per cent to {XEU}90 60 yesterday Pernod reported a 2001 net profit of {XEU}358m $316m compared with {XEU}195m boosted by {XEU}220m of exceptional gains following the sale of some brands acquired as part of the Seagram transaction including Orangina-Pampryl the soft drinks business sold to Cadbury Schweppes Pernod also hopes to complete in coming months the sale of BWG its wholesale distribution business to Electra a British venture capital firm Operating profit rose 7 per cent last year to {XEU}451m Pernod forecast that operating profit in its core business would double this year ,1
2002-06-28, For all the hullabaloo about Jim Nicol's multi-million pay package at Tomkins his first day in the public eye was anticlimatic Analysts meeting him for the first time yesterday remarked that Mr Nicol delivered a low-key performance short on numbers but long on muted enthusiasm for his new employer While ability to make peppy presentations is probably not at the top of the list of requirements for chief executives these days Mr Nicol who joined Tomkins in February and has since been fine-tuning its strategy could have given analysts a clearer picture of his plans for the company To be fair he has the right idea He wants Tomkins to streamline its manufacturing operations to explore other markets in Europe and Asia to develop its technologies and to get rid of unprofitable operations He is encouraging managers to communicate more and spread good ideas across the group rather than looking at it as an investment portfolio These are undoubtedly principles that helped him turn around Magna International the Canadian components group But where are the numbers Tomkins does not have the financial problems of Invensys but it would be helpful if Mr Nicol had been more specific about the type of top-line growth he wanted from each division Equally he might have elaborated on the plans for acquisitions and disposals if only to give investors a better sense of what lies ahead The advantage to a strategy such as Mr Nicol's is that there is little danger of disappointing the market at least in the short run Allen Yurko former chief executive of Invensys and a North American like Mr Nicol learned the hard way the perils of promising too much and delivering too little Given the uncertainty about the recent direction of the US economy on which Tomkins is so dependent Mr Nicol might have disheartened investors and his employees if he had said more Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about £296m for the year to December 2003 At yesterday's closing share price this gives Tomkins a prospective p/e of about 12 in line with the rest of the sector Until Mr Nicol lives up to the promise implied in his salary this seems fair ,2

2002-06-13, From Dr Geof Rayner Sir I always consider it a fine use of my time to read Amity Shlaes' column much better than having to wade through all those press releases from Washington rightwing think-tanks or the White House She provides precise illumination of the mindset of these people and reminds us that no matter who or what Iraq being only the latest US perceptions of self-interest will always be presented in universalistic terms and driven by good intentions Similarly in opposing current US views on the importance of the Iraqi threat Europeans are being told by Ms Shlaes June 11 that they are not motivated by the real nature of the threat but by a particularly heavy chip on their collective shoulders Given the US's past impact on and continuing involvement in Afghanistan Iraq Israel/ Palestine and so on its undermining of both Nato and the UN and its dismissal of the Geneva Convention in the case of the Camp X-ray prisoners perhaps this is the only defensive route left to Ms Shlaes and her ilk The underlying implication of this threadbare stuff and the most worrying one for Europeans remains that the only opinion US policymakers truly value when setting foreign policy is domestic Geof Rayner London SW17 7HQ,3
1998-04-01, Jefferson Smurfit the Irish paper and packaging group expects prices in the sector to recover this year after a difficult 1997 Dermot Smurfit deputy chairman said We see ourselves as being at the bottom of the cycle What is encouraging is that there has been a significant moderation on the capacity side within the industry This points to a sustainable recovery  The group which had cash of I£665m £550m at the end of last year up from I£636m also said it was considering returning capital to shareholders if it could not find value-adding investment opportunities It has authority to buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares at a cost of about I£235m It is thought to be keen either to take control of Jefferson Smurfit Corporation its US associate in which it has a 46 5 per cent stake or to merge it with another North American group Analysts said the threat of a buy-back might induce the Morgan Stanley equity funds the other main shareholders to agree terms Smurfit is also thought to be considering acquiring a paper plant in Brazil Mr Smurfit's comments accompanied the announcement of a sharp fall in pre-tax profits to I£150m I£201m on flat sales of I£2 57bn However the results were in line with expectations and the shares closed unchanged in London at 171{1/2}p The group said profits were well above those in the last downturn reflecting lower costs It had achieved higher than expected savings of I£55m in the first year of a three-year I£100m cost cutting programme Earnings per share were 9 8p 12 6p For tax reasons the group is planning to pay the final dividend as a first interim for 1998 of 2 97p This is on top of an interim of 1 65p and compares with a total of 4 2p last year Comment  Forecasts for this year vary enormously reflecting analysts' differing views on where prices in the industry are headed and on how quickly Smurfit can cut costs Most pre-tax profit forecasts range from I£190m to I£230m putting the forward p/e above 16 but at least one observer expects I£250m What would help the shares perhaps even more than returning capital would be news on JSC Rolling that business into a venture with a large North American group might be a neat way of solving the apparent impasse with Morgan Stanley The shares are still at a premium to the sector but less so than in the past they are down from a year high of 214{1/2}p making them a hold ,2

2002-04-01, Homebase the DIY group considering a flotation is to make an early repayment of £240m to the original backers who financed the group's £750m purchase from J Sainsbury last year It follows a buoyant trading period in the year to January that resulted in strong cash generation Homebase which has just concluded its first year as an independent group is to report full-year figures in about five weeks when sales are expected to rise from £1 25bn to more than £1 4bn Profits before interest and tax of about £40m in 2000-01 are also expected to show a strong improvement It is also likely to confirm that sales in the current year have made an impressive start partly a reflection of an early Easter The group is budgeting for a 40 per cent rise in sales in the week ending March 30 compared with the previous week The DIY sector is one of the stars of a particularly buoyant retailing market Homebase is 70 per cent owned by Permira the venture capital group formerly known as Schroder Ventures J Sainsbury has 18 per cent with the balance held by management Homebase is to repay £65m in mezzanine debt and a further £175m of shareholder loans The return has come earlier than anticipated due to good trading performance the group said The repayment will lead to a small increase in bank debt Permira is known to be considering exit strategies for its Homebase investment However it may decide to delay an exit given the growth being achieved at the DIY retailer and choose to withdraw for a higher return at a later date There are bags of steam in this business for the next four to five years the group said this weekend Homebase had 289 stores at the time of the sale Five were sold to B&Q as part of the deal and a further 10 closed shrinking the portfolio to 274 Rob Templeman previously with Harvey's Furnishing joined as chief executive on March 16 last year at the same time as Chris Woodhouse finance director As part of the deal J Sainsbury retained freehold properties which were leased to Homebase Sainsbury reinvested £31m for its 18 per cent ,1
2002-06-28, The International Monetary Fund will today approve its next $1 1bn loan tranche for Turkey as political uncertainty continues to threaten the country's IMF-backed economic rescue programme The latest part of Turkey's record $16 3bn IMF loan has become even more important since Turkey's financial markets were shaken by the news of prime minister Bulent Ecevit's illness Mr Ecevit 77 who is credited with personally holding together a fractious three-party coalition was hospitalised for 10 days in early May During his convalescence at home markets have been gripped by fears of a collapse of the coalition followed by early elections and the demise of Turkey's hitherto successful IMF-backed reform plan Yesterday Mr Ecevit fuelled the uncertainty when he professed to see early elections on the horizon only to claim shortly afterwards that he had been misunderstood and that he did not want early polls His retraction was seen by some analysts as designed to minimise further upset to financial markets while he confers with his coalition partners whom he plans to meet on Monday Today's IMF loan had been held up until bank regulators with Mr Ecevit's blessing last week seized Pamukbank the seventh-largest bank The government agreed to the takeover of Pamukbank only after the IMF hit them round the head with a very big stick said a western banker in Istanbul If the next loan tranche had been withheld by the IMF Turkey would have faced another crisis  A devaluation in February 2001 pushed the government to agree to reforms dismantling state interference in the economy in return for fresh IMF loans to avoid a debt default The US government Turkey's closest ally and the IMF last week praised the Pamukbank takeover as illustrating the government's commitment to those reforms Pamukbank had posed a threat to the banking system with a capital shortfall last week estimated at $2bn Apart from leading to stricter banking supervision the IMF-backed programme had until the recent turmoil produced a sharp fall in inflation amid early signs of a resumption of economic growth after a 10 per cent contraction in gross national product last year Over the past two months however interest rates have shot up 20 percentage points to 73 per cent and the lira has weakened to 1600000 to the dollar from 1300000 Although interest rates are still close to the 70 per cent level projected for June by the government concerns could resurface about Turkey's ability to service its public sector debt unless they start falling Mr Ecevit can hope for some relief from parliament going into recess next week But markets are still looking to see how the coalition proposes to delay elections which are not due until 2004 until at least next year when the economy might be stronger ,2
2002-06-10, Corus is working on a get-out plan under which it could scupper its proposed $43bn L2 7bn takeover of CSN the Brazilian steelmaker should prospects for the Brazilian economy worsen The Anglo-Dutch steel producer is particularly exercised by the possibility of a left-wing government taking power in Brazil in next month's elections in which case nationalisation of important industrial plants could be a possibility Corus said yesterday What we have so far is a non-binding agreement We could walk away from this if we felt the deal was not in our interests  Tony Pedder Corus chief executive will provide further details when presenting half-year results on Thursday He is expected to reiterate that given the information available the move still makes sense Peter Marsh ,1

2002-06-04, The likelihood of the first strike in the German construction industry in more than 50 years increased yesterday after the building workers' union IG Bau called a strike ballot following the collapse of arbitration talks at the weekend The union is seeking a 4 5 per cent pay increase for its 950000 members in the crisis-ridden sector and wage parity in eastern and western Germany demands rejected by employers The ballot will be held on June 15 with strikes starting on June 17 at the earliest The IG Bau indicated that strikes might be concentrated in Berlin and Frankfurt The German federation of construction companies said the union was playing with fire in light of the many bankruptcies and rising unemployment in the sector Hugh Williamson Berlin,3
2002-06-21, The president and chief executive of the US Chamber of Commerce which represents more than 3m companies and organisations yesterday condemned recent moves by the Japanese government to intervene in foreign exchange markets Thomas Donohue said in an interview that artificial valuations never worked and added My message is that we welcome your exports but don't bet your house on how much of your stuff we will buy  The Japanese government has intervened repeatedly to hold the yen at about Y125 to the dollar The government is worried a strengthening currency could threaten the early stirrings of an export-led recovery Mr Donohue who visited senior corporate and ministerial figures during his trip to Japan also said apparent moves by the Japanese government to discourage foreign investment in its financial sector sent out a very negative message to the world He was referring to alleged pressure exerted by the government on Shinsei bank which is owned by a group of overseas investors led by Ripplewood the US investment fund to treat its borrowers more favourably and stop calling in problem loans There have also been reports recently that the Financial Services Agency the main regulator is considering imposing a 20 per cent limit on foreign ownership of some Japanese financial institutions The world is watching said Mr Donohue The way capital is welcomed will send a message to people about whether or not capital should come to Japan  He encouraged the Japanese government to move rapidly to remove the structural impediments that remain on foreign investment Money goes where it feels comfortable he said I say don't depend on the US to solve all the economic problems don't make agreements and then not keep them and don't play around with foreign exchange markets ,3
2002-06-22, Everyone professional and amateur observer alike agrees the London housing market has had a stupendous first half this year But even estate agents concede it cannot continue at the same pace The question is will prices just level off or will the boom that has gone on for so long be followed by a crash similar to the one 10 years ago when prices fell 25 per cent Interest rates will be the key How far and how fast they go up will determine the scale of any downturn says Mark Coulter residential sales director at Hurford Salvi Carr which specialises in properties in Clerkenwell and the City of London fringes There are no signs of it yet Turnover is strong and demand is good although capital growth in this area is now limited by the problems in the City  The renewed strength in the market this year after the post-September 11 dip came as a surprise to many The capital's economy has been badly hit by the worst recession in the City of London in 30 years and the steepest-ever downturn in advertising which has hit the media sector Tourism is only slowly recovering from the double whammy of the foot-and-mouth outbreak and the terrorist attacks These negative factors have been offset by interest rates falling to a 38-year low accompanied by mouth-watering deals in a competitive mortgage market The Bank of England's low-interest strategy designed to keep the economy moving last autumn has succeeded beyond expectations for consumers to the extent that Sir Edward George the Bank's governor last week warned housebuyers to be cautious in taking on debt House prices in the capital have risen about 10 per cent from a year ago Everywhere from prime central London to the fringes of outer London the market has been characterised by an acute shortage of properties for sale This is a market primarily driven by investment considerations says Yolanda Barnes head of research at property agent FPDSavills It is not just buy-to-let purchasers who buy property for investment People are investing in property for themselves and for their children as they feel this is a good home for their money at a time when stock market returns are disappointing  Just as important as interest rates in setting the tone in the market is confidence In prime London this is the most important driver says Linda Beaney of agent Beaney Pearce Most owners are from overseas 80 per cent in Mayfair and 60 per cent in Kensington If they decide that London is not where they want to keep their money perhaps because of an unfavourable change in their tax status or a falling currency the effect could be dramatic Instructions at the top end of the market are 30 per cent higher this month than a year ago so some are already taking profits  No one is predicting a downturn on the scale of the early 1990s If you look at the multiplier of earnings being used by lenders for granting mortgages they are still at sensible levels of three or four times says Adrian Owen of Hamptons International Similarly loan-to-value ratios are still reasonable at around 60 per cent You would have to see this reach 75 per cent before there was any real prospect of a serious drop in house prices  Some local spots in the market might be vulnerable Owen suggests that family houses in inner suburbs such as Putney and Wandsworth might struggle to find buyers if interest rates rise The problem in these areas is that buyers have to trade up from small houses worth about £500000 to family homes costing more than £800000 There is nothing in between If confidence weakens there could be fewer buyers willing to take on that big an increase in debt Otherwise the highly indebted may be forced to sell They could be in any part of the market  Agents remain confident that London property is a sound investment over the medium term DTZ has just published its Prime Central London Residential report for this year and forecasts a rise of 8-10 per cent in house prices in prime areas over the next 12 months Peter Braithwaite managing director of DTZ Residential comments The continued limited supply of property in prime locations combined with the increased popularity of property as an investment vehicle means that the medium to long-term outlook for the central London market is very positive  DTZ's research shows that the areas that have enjoyed the best capital appreciation in the past year have been in the better parts of East London with prices of one-bedroom apartments in E1 and E14 rising by 22 per cent The geographical heart of London's residential district has moved eastwards from Knightsbridge to the City and beyond over the past five years says Braithwaite He expects Islington and Clerkenwell prices to rise to match prime London prices in the next few years It is now difficult to find areas that can be described as up-and-coming as everywhere seems expensive DTZ suggests buyers wanting to make capital gains out of improving areas should look to where the developers are moving Future hot spots will include Holloway Stoke Newington Wembley and White City Improved transport in south-east London should help Greenwich Deptford and Woolwich and areas east along the Thames Gateway the developing area downriver from Docklands In the rentals market signs are that the tide may be on the turn The problems of an oversupply of properties and a dearth of tenants in the past nine months have been well documented Rents have fallen steeply down about 12 per cent on average from a year ago and more at the top end of the market Corporate tenants were in short supply in the aftermath of September 11 A continuing oversupply of buy-to-let properties has hit owners catering for young professional tenants The corporate lettings market has begun to recover and may now be reaching a point of equilibrium Confidence is coming back but only slowly says Clemmie Bailey lettings manager at Lane Fox's Chelsea office The second half of the year is always busier as many moves are linked to the academic year Now the jubilee is out of the way people are focusing on finding flats or houses for September But we are taking it day by day  Buy-to-let investors appear to be taking the downturn in their stride for the time being I had hoped that the weakness in the rental market would encourage some investors to sell to ease the chronic shortage of small flats in this area says Mark Coulter But so far it hasn't happened  DTZ calculates that about 50000 properties in inner London were sold to investors last year and that about 40 per cent of these buyers were acquiring property as a key nest-egg instead of investing in a pension Schemes that have attracted significant numbers of nest-egg investors include Chelsea Bridge Wharf near Battersea Bridge and Royal Arsenal at Woolwich where 95 per cent of the flats launched in the first phase in March were sold on the first weekend With this level of pent-up demand the market will be able to absorb a few rate rises before prices buckle It's going to be a challenging autumn comments Linda Beaney Simply because the last few months have just been too easy ,2
2002-06-29, American capitalism may not be rotten to the core but in the wake of WorldCom's accounting revelations it has become difficult to believe that there are not more bad apples Friday's bigger-than-expected mis-statement of revenues at Xerox suggests investors are right to remain fearful Optimists might say that WorldCom was a one-off already under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and close to bankruptcy Its shares had dropped almost 99 per cent from their peak ahead of the discovery of a $3 8bn £2 6bn hole in its accounts this week But one of the few things expanding rapidly in the current environment is the list of SEC investigations into corporate governance irregularities From investigations of off-balance sheet loans at cable company Adelphia to revenue inflating schemes at Global Crossing and Dynegy the SEC is very busy and that is without Enron Each additional company name added to the list eats away at investor confidence in the reliability of corporate earnings Previous market crises have in time come to be viewed as one-off climactic events For example the Russian debt crisis and the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 were events that were effectively dealt with by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts It is very tough to believe WorldCom marks the end of the potential scandals And how can you expect a rapid market comeback when you cannot trust the earnings the rebound should be built on Investors may not be deterred from the stock market entirely but the equity risk premium will rise in recompense for the perceived higher risks of holding shares A rising risk premium has helped drive down equity prices creating a larger mountain to climb when the recovery eventually starts But the impact may last longer The consensus view is for the world to remain a low inflation low growth environment with weaker earnings growth than seen in the 1990s It appears the risks attached to these lower returns may also be higher and investors may only tolerate lower valuations in the future The lasting impact of scandals such as WorldCom may be their contribution to a world characterised by lower investment returns UK investors can take some comfort from an accounting system that is based more on principles than rules although UK companies are not above question Vodafone's treatment of goodwill and inclusion of earnings from operations where it only holds minority stakes has raised eyebrows in some quarters At the broader level the UK is at risk from exposures in the financial sector which lies at the hub of equity markets' fears Concerns over the health of companies leveraged to the hilt debt-default fears at the sovereign level and worries over corporate governance all weigh on the sector Banks account for 18 per cent of the market capitalisation of the FTSE All-Share index and since May 3 the sector has fallen 15 per cent With much credit risk held in the corporate bond market the UK banks avoided serious fallout from Enron earlier in the year but the drip feed of bad news has taken its toll Another corporate casualty on the scale of WorldCom or further credit problems in Brazil could send the banking sector tumbling Insurers have fared even worse due to greater exposure to corporate bonds and fears that declining stock markets will force equity sales to meet regulatory requirements on their investment portfolios The insurers have moved quickly this week to reassure investors of the adequacy of their financial reserves and the Financial Services Authority has eased the stringency of the solvency guidelines but further falls in equity prices would bring fresh doubts  Head and shoulders forming Technical analysis is a tool designed to take the sentiment out of investing chart patterns have no regard for the bullish bias of investment banking research or long-only fund managers A significant chart pattern is forming on several stock indices It is visible on the FTSE Eurotop 300 and most clearly on the S&P 500 chart A close below the September 21 low at 944 75 on the S&P 500 would complete the formation and set a downside target in the region of 350 a level not seen in more than a decade The head-and-shoulders is a widely followed pattern that forms after an up trend and signals the trend has reversed direction As the name suggests it is formed by three successive peaks The middle peak or head marks the high point of the up trend and is flanked by two lower and roughly equal peaks which form the shoulders The pattern is completed when the market closes below the neckline a line drawn through the troughs between the peaks The accompanying chart shows the head formed at the March 2000 high while the 1998 run-up and subsequent decline formed the left shoulder The rally after last September's attacks on the US and its subsequent unravelling form the right shoulder The shoulders peaked at similar levels 1190 and 1176 and both lasted about nine months producing a textbook version of the pattern The neckline is drawn through the October 1998 and September 2001 lows There is some margin for error when drawing trend lines on long-term charts but with a close below 944 75 the neckline would clearly be broken The price objective is the distance between the head and the neckline directly below it applied to the point of breakdown In this instance the March 2000 high was at 1553 and the neckline around 935 giving a projected move of 618 points Applied to the point at which the neckline is broken around 950 gives an eventual target of 332 for the S&P 500 Like any chart formation the head and shoulders does not work every time But while a break of the September lows would no doubt unleash a further wave of negative sentiment many dispassionate technical analysts would also be looking for further significant downside ,2
2002-04-12, Stanfield Capital Partners a New York-based investment group that focuses on credit-based alternativeinvestment products is expanding its distressed debt operations and has hired a 15-year Putnam Investments veteran to spearhead its push into the market Robert Paine has joined Stanfield as a senior portfolio manager in charge of the firm's distressed debt and special situations group including both high-yield bonds and leveraged loans Previously he oversaw $1bn in distressed debt and formerly bankrupt companies for Boston-based Putnam one of the world's largest high-yield managers with more than $12bn in high-yield assets under management Mr Paine said he left Putnam on amicable terms and his departure was unrelated to the fund shake-up at the Boston firm which last month announced plans to close or merge 11 of its 66 mutual funds The largest fund merger combines the $1 5bn Putnam High Yield Trust II with the $1 7bn Putnam High Yield Trust Mr Paine was part of the high-yield or junk bond team At Stanfield which is currently raising a new distressed debt fund that Mr Paine will manage he will have greater flexibility in his investment approach Distressed debt specialists such as Mr Paine assess the value of a company and determine the point within the capital structure where they can realise the best return for the risk they assume Distressed debt is one of the most active areas within alternative investments today because of the supply of new paper and the high returns available In the late 1990s many companies issued high-yield debt but ran into problems meeting their obligations when the economy turned down As a result there is a large supply of paper available to investors willing to bet on which companies will be able to repay their debts Hedge funds and large institutional investors including US endowments and foundations have been increasing their allocations to distressed debt in part because they face lagging returns on stocks and private equity The market for distressed bonds and distressed loans reached $110 1bn and $34 8bn respectively in the third quarter last year Investing in distressed securities is an integral part of our overall investment strategy said Dan Baldwin chief investment officer at Stanfield which was set up four years ago and began to expand into the distressed debt market a year ago Combined with our investments in leveraged loans high yield bonds investment grade debt and mezzanine debt the distressed arena provides Stanfield with another avenue to fully utilise our fundamental credit analysis infrastructure  Commenting on his appointment Mr Paine said This is a tremendous time for the distressed sector There are opportunities in industries as diverse as entertainment and energy hospitality lodging and old- line manufacturing  Mr Paine joined Putnam as an analyst in the firm's high-yield group concentrating on cable media telecommunications restaurants gaming and broadcasting From 1995 to 1999 he was portfolio manager for Putnam's high-yield group overseeing more than $5bn in both institutional and retail accounts at the firm ,2
2002-06-05, Despite anti-European political rumblings from France and Italy draft EU directives aimed at boosting a growing cross-border shareholder democracy are already in the price as far as fund managers and their institutional clients are concerned But some local difficulties remain The first draft directive for takeover bids was rejected by the European parliament in July last year after 12 years of negotiations This led to the establishment of a high level group of company law experts including Jaap Winter legal adviser to Unilever Jonathan Pickford consultant for the UK's Department of Trade and Industry and Guido Rossi former president of Italian financial regulator Consob The big idea to be enshrined in the next draft is that ultimate decisions as to corporate fortunes should always be down to the shareholders Scottish Widows Investment Partnership Swip which runs {XEU}125bn is one of the cross-border fund operations to embrace this new European mantra It is one of several once Anglo-centric managers which have successfully warmed to the European theme and this is the first year that revenue from Swip's continental clients has overtaken UK fees A link-up with investment bank Cofiri Sim is aimed at penetrating the tight-knit Italian market Swip has recently been given up to {XEU}20m of the Italian surveyors pension fund to oversee Within these portfolios the shareholder democracy angle is the most important theme says Chris Walker Swip's head of business development Shareholder power is massively improving companies across Europe It is improving in terms of transparency of decisions and the whole concept of investor relations Germany is moving the fastest  F&C Management a London-based investment group which runs {XEU}110bn in institutional assets is another player benefiting from an increasing appreciation of Anglo-Saxon values on the Continent F&C recently absorbed Dutch insurance company Achmea Ireland's Friends First and Greece's Intertrust Before last year's merger Achmea managed {XEU}12 5bn for Dutch metalworkers pension fund PMI But PMI was not impressed with Achmea's unreliable client reporting systems and poor investment performance and re-tendered the brief F&C Achmea's new owner managed to retrieve {XEU}7bn 90 per cent of the original fund when the assets came up for tender last December Our Dutch clients have stayed because they appreciate British standards but they know they have a fullyfledged operation run by Dutch people in the Netherlands says F&C director Alain de Grisay Mr de Grisay says F&C shared its re-organisation plans with clients such as PMI from day one Instead of making vague promises we laid down a timetable to complete the full re-organisation To get there we needed the trust of clients the support of both Christian Democrat and Socialist unions in the Netherlands and the works councils We couldn't afford to have even one of them saying no  While operations are now centralised in London more specialised functions such as client servicing and investment in credit real estate and convertibles are handled by 100 staff in the Netherlands Now we have integrated the group in terms of investment process which is run to the highest Anglo-Saxon standards said Mr de Grisay Ask any Dutch client about the difference in dealing with a UK fund manager and a Continental one  Mr de Grisay wants to introduce clients in other European countries to this new style of investment management as pensions reform begins to bite Speed is of the essence he believes and investing in equities essential to finance adequate retirement provision Mr de Grisay is referring to rumours that the Spanish delegation to the EU wanted to insert a clause into the pension directive bill limiting investment in equities to 50 per cent of any EU-based pension fund While Spain stopped short of this draconian measure it has proposed equally autocratic limits on pension schemes' exposure to unlisted investments such as private equity Everyone in this business should have learned about the investment curve and the positive effect of private equity on pension fund portfolios says Guiseppe Campanella private equity chief investment officer for the Milan-based fund management joint venture between State Street of the US and local company Mediolanum Mr Campanella already runs {XEU}165m in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds for Italian clients including a smattering of small pension funds and major regional foundations Cariplo and Cariverona He now plans to structure a specific co-investment vehicle for Italian metalworkers pension fund Cometa Because Cometa has union members on its board creative investments have to be found which avoid restructuring and lay-offs For a long-term portfolio private equity is a must said Mr Campanella There is no other long-term investment which can generate comparable returns  Yuri Bender is editor of Financial Times Business publication FT Mandate,1
2002-04-18, Trade and immigration policy were two of George W Bush's chief claims to virtue The US president stood for free trade never once surrendering to the protectionist slogan free but fair trade unlike many Democrats He was also a spirited opponent of anti-immigration rhetoric and sentiments unlike many Republicans A year into his presidency however it is clear that his actions on both issues have been marked by folly He has violated the essential principles of non-discrimination reversing long-standing US policies embodying them It is time to sound the alarm bells Take trade policy The Bush administration's surrender to protectionism on steel was deplorable enough Worse still is the way the steel tariffs have been implemented The point of safeguard action is that it is non-discriminatory That is why economists have advocated its use in preference to anti-dumping actions where a specific trader often the most efficient supplier or the least preferred is targeted if the politics gets tough But the administration has proceeded to find all sorts of ways presumably compatible with World Trade Organisation rules to exempt friends such as Brazil South Africa and South Korea while targeting others such as the European Union More astonishing is that when US steel users predictably lined up in droves to plead for exemptions the Bush administration obliged in preferential fashion The willingness to sacrifice non-discrimination to political expediency is even more manifest in Mr Bush's immigration policy It is seen at its worst in the recent pro-immigration initiatives that have been designed and targeted to benefit Mexico and its illegal emigrants across the Rio Grande Presidents Bush and Vincente Fox have been engaged in designing US immigration policy reforms exclusively from the lens of Mexican migrants In return for stricter border enforcement the proposed policy changes would offer permanent residence to Mexicans illegally in the US and a guest worker programme for other Mexicans Mr Bush's proposals are hard to fault if one sees them only as a pro-immigration step Yet folly they are The privileged and exclusive largesse shown towards Mexicans alone strikes at the egalitarian and non-discriminatory principles that have characterised the country's immigration policy for almost four decades The Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965 explicitly introduced the principle of equal access to immigration admission by abolishing the national origins formula that was introduced in 1921 By 1978 the last vestiges of differential geographic treatment in the form of different annual ceilings for immigrants from the different hemispheres had been removed These adjustments were made despite specific objections that special consideration should be made for contiguous countries particularly Mexico The 1965 provisions are the reason we see among legal immigrants in the US a multitude of exotic ethnicities and a profusion of colour and religion that would have been unthinkable in an earlier era Since 1965 therefore any immigration measure of importance built on explicit discrimination among potential immigrants has been considered repugnant to the principle of non-discrimination Indeed the last amnesty in 1986 under Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior was non- discriminatory even though two-thirds of the beneficiaries were Mexicans Why then is Mr Bush proposing the regression on immigration policy The reasons rest on specious arguments that Mexico makes a special claim on the US and cynical arguments that play to domestic politics The principal argument in support of Mexico's special claim is that Mexico is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement According to this view immigration is simply part of deeper integration that should mimic the preferences on trade But there are several free trade arrangements without immigration preferences Does the US plan similar preferences for Israel and Canada and then for Jordan Chile Singapore and Vietnam Then again the Rio Grande is often thought to be the frontier through which virtually all illegal immigrants enter the US it would thus seem the logical focus of policy Yet even this perspective is flawed For some years now the proportion of illegal immigrants flowing into the US from elsewhere has been greater The driving force behind this bizarre for-Mexico-only proposal is none of these Rather it is domestic politics and in particular the Hispanic vote Has Mr Bush decided to write off the growing numbers of Asians and others many of whom now vote who will see this as a blatant act of discrimination Putting politics before principles is understandable if the principles are unimportant and the political payoffs are likely That is not the case here Jagdish Bhagwati is a professor at Columbia University He and Arthur Helton are senior fellows at the Council on Foreign Relations,3
2002-04-10, AorTech the Scottish medical device company yesterday unveiled an ambitious plan to double in size through the $52m £36m acquisition of the critical care operations of Becton Dickinson of the US Eddie McDaid chairman and chief executive said the deal would increase turnover eightfold to more than $54m and generate vital cash to fund clinical trials I won't say this deal will stop us coming back to the market for fresh funding he said But it should mitigate the need  Without this deal AorTech's £16 5m cash pile would run out next year Cash burn is running at an annual £11m AorTech will pay half of the purchase price upfront with all but a couple of million funded through bank debt The rest would be payable over 30 months subject to sales performance Mr McDaid stressed that if sales failed to take off he could choose to pay the balance of the purchase price in shares The BD unit makes and sells a range of monitoring devices and catheters The sale portfolio also comprises stock intellectual property and a manufacturing facility in Singapore which AorTech plans to use to scale up production of its TruCCOMS heart monitoring device BD has been AorTech's European and east Asian distribution partner for TruCCOMS since last May However its critical care division was inherited through an acquisition several years ago and was non-core generating barely 1 per cent of group turnover last year Mr McDaid refused to disclose the BD unit's profits but said they were in the single-digit millions of dollars Analysts said the price paid was low Max Herrmann at ING said This makes a lot of sense They secure production capacity they regain control of distribution and they get cash flow to fund further clinical trials  However he said the cheapness of the deal did not imply too much about the value of TruCCOMS whose sales are rumoured not to have lived up to expectations Mr McDaid stressed the product was still in its infancy but would soon be the company's lead revenue generator It is the world's only instant-reading cardiac monitoring device ,1
2002-06-04, Bulent Ecevit Turkey's ailing 77-year-prime minister is facing increasing pressure to resign to stem uncertainty that is threatening prospects of an economic recovery this year Political analysts said yesterday that important segments of the business community as well as the influential armed forces seen as a stabilising factor in times of crisis favour the appointment of Husamettin Ozkan Mr Ecevit's right-hand man as caretaker prime minister Mr Ozkan a suave political operator who stays out of the public eye is also the only potential substitute from Mr Ecevit's Democratic Left party DSP acceptable to the rightwing National Action party MHP the other main component of the three-party coalition Expectations that elections will take place before they are due in 2004 have been fuelled by Mr Ecevit's health problems But business leaders and even some opposition politicians want to delay early elections until next year Turkey is still in the throes of important structural reforms backed by a $16 3bn £11bn {XEU}17 4bn loan from the International Monetary Fund Simultaneously Ankara is hoping by pushing through a raft of overdue human rights reforms to persuade the EU to name at its Copenhagen summit in December a tentative date for starting accession talks For his part Mr Ecevit has said he fears worse damage if he quits But supporters of this view who once saw the prime minister as irreplaceable have diminished in number since he missed an important meeting of civilian and military leaders three days after leaving hospital declaring himself to be fine and in charge Rahsan Ecevit the prime minister's wife who is also deputy-chairman of the DSP has come under particularly fierce attack Critics want her to encourage Mr Ecevit to step down from government and appoint a credible successor to lead the DSP Echoing political circles and media commentators Tuncay Ozilhan chairman of Tusiad the business federation urged the Ecevits late on Sunday to plan for the fact that the prime minister's health meant he could no longer perform important services for the country ,3
2002-06-04, It is becomingincreasingly fashionable to argue that the government must rely more on the so-called public service ethos when providing services such as healthcare and education The claim is that both the market-type incentives used by the Conservative government of the early 1990s and the increased centralisation under Labour since 1997 have failed They demotivated the managers and demoralised the professionals working in the service The result is a collapsing health service and a crumbling education system Proponents of this view say the answer is to return to the pre-1990 days when professionals and other workers supposedly motivated by the spirit of public service could be trusted to do their jobs They advocate dismantling the system of financial incentives target-setting and oppressive monitoring Instead public servants should be allowed to fulfil their vocation of serving the public The snag is that most of the propositions on which this view is based are not true particularly those relating to market competition In education Labour has preserved the market mechanisms introduced by the previous government but has added an element of centralisation via the numeracy and literacy hour A study by the London School of Economics shows that the results have been impressive The percentage of pupils reaching a given level of achievement in the national attainment tests in England increased steadily between 1995 the first full year of tests and 2001 particularly at the end of primary school Some improvements were remarkable For example the percentage of pupils gaining the expected level of competence in maths at the end of primary school moved from 45 per cent in 1995 to 70 per cent in 2001 By contrast the best available evidence suggests there was no improvement in the maths skills of children in the early years of secondary school for 30 years before 1995 In health the changes were positive but less impressive Under the National Health Service internal market the rate of hospital productivity rose from 1 5 per cent a year before 1991 to 2 per cent afterwards Following dilution of the internal market in 1997 the same index has fallen The lesson is that market-type incentives perhaps combined with a judicious mix of centralisation can work Moreover they seem to work better than simple reliance on professional goodwill The government has recognised this in its latest proposals for reforming the NHS which amount to a regulated internal market in elective surgery with the money following the patient and a super-regulator for monitoring and inspection However the new proposals for the NHS have an Achilles' heel In one area the government is still relying on the public service ethos to achieve the improvements it wants the reward structure of consultants Currently NHS consultants have a contract with the government and are paid a salary There has been relatively little monitoring of their activity the system has operated on the basis of trust As a result consultants have little direct interest in the financial health of their institution Nor are they under direct managerial control of those who are interested the hospital managers So incentives directed at the institutions' finances have little leverage over consultants There is another problem If consultants reduce their NHS commitment and salary by a small fraction they are allowed to work as much as they like in the private sector where they are paid a fee for their services The effect is to create a perverse incentive structure because any extra work that they do is compensated in the private sector but not in the public sector If the aim of policy is to shorten NHS waiting lists the existence of a fee-for-service incentive structure running alongside one based on trust undermines the latter's ability to achieve that aim It is not surprising that recent evidence from Birmingham University suggests NHS consultant productivity is falling The consultant contract is being renegotiated The government's proposal for dealing with the incentive problem is to ban consultants from private practice for seven years after their appointment This is deeply unpopular with the profession and does not tackle the fundamental mismatch of incentives Since the government cannot influence the private sector's methods of payment the only answer is for the public sector to work in a similar fashion to pay fees for services provided This could be at say 80 per cent of the private sector rate to allow for a measure of public service sacrifice Fee for service in the public sector has its problems but experience suggests it is safer to rely on self-interested motivations than on apparently altruistic ones The government's alternative is to face the next election with a much more expensive but even less productive NHS than now The writer is professor of social policy at the London School of Economics,3
2002-06-21, From Mr Steve Lloyd Sir Any bank that has not begun planning for the euro is in big trouble Banks need to start euro switch before referendum June 19 Not only do they still have to ensure their processes and systems are euro-compatible they also need to be fully prepared to compete in the inevitably larger marketplace Already almost half of UK consumers would be prepared to purchase financial products such as loans from continental Europe if rates were preferential to those of UK banks With margins already squeezed to their limit on current accounts this is not good news for banks UK banks simply cannot afford to be complacent They cannot afford to view it simply as a Y2K equivalent the element of increased competition makes this different They need to be planning for the changes before it gets too late and customers take their business to more flexible overseas competitors Steve Lloyd Business Development Director Finance CMG London SW1V 1LW,1
2002-06-28, Corporate bond indices which act as a benchmark for many bond investors have slipped into the red following the dramatic price falls in the market after the WorldCom $3 8bn fraud came to light earlier this week Poor performance in the telecommunications technology and energy sectors has dragged down all corporate bond indices But other sectors have made gains in the first half of the year Overall the Lehman Brothers index of corporate bonds is down by 18 basis points relative to government bonds meaning that the corporate sector has underperformed In the first half of last year corporate bonds made excess returns of 130bp and were up 95bp in the whole of 2001 The performance varies greatly according to sectors said David Munves European credit markets strategist at Lehman Brothers Non-telecoms have outperformed and will continue to outperform in the second half of the year For telecoms it is more difficult to say  The telecoms sector was the worst performer mirroring the sector's performance in the equity markets Within telecoms there are differences between those companies that remain heavily indebted such as France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom and others that do not face such pressure on their credit ratings Overall telecoms bonds underperformed by 370 basis points during the first half of the year Looking ahead the market may still make losses but the high interest now earned on telecoms debt holdings will boost the overall returns made from the sector Corporate bond investors are getting used to turbulence in their market In 2000 corporate bonds made losses on the year down 72 basis points relative to government markets Again the telecoms sector was largely responsible Many investors remain keen on non-telecoms debt however although the supply of debt generally is expected to fall in the second half Many companies have refinanced debt in the first half of the year and there is not too much need for new financing in the current environment Away from the telecoms sector analysts said many companies in both Europe and the US had been focused on reducing indebtedness by improving real cashflow For companies that have improved their balance sheets the bond markets are expected to remain an attractive investment although the market tone will remain sensitive The companies boasting clean and transparent balance sheets should be able to ride out the storm but nonetheless risk premia levels for lower-rated investment grade issuers could ratchet upwards in the face of more negative news said Philip Crate credit analyst at Bear Stearns He said credit markets would remain fairly calibrated for the foreseeable future Investors will exercise a greater degree of care towards those companies over which this is a major debt overhang or refinancing requirement he said The accounting scam at WorldCom has not resulted in a complete meltdown in the debt markets although the price of WorldCom debt widely held by many investors has collapsed by 60 per cent since the revelations to about 15 cents in the dollar but investors must be on the lookout for further disasters Analysts said markets might not be able to withstand another shock quite so well ,2
2002-06-06, None of the many issues facing US stock and options markets this year can compare with what the community of traders dealers and the exchanges themselves faced last September The attacks on the World Trade Center closed US markets for nearly a week and the scale of lives lost will reverberate for years to come They appear however to have left the markets in no worse structural shape although certain plans have been altered as a result especially by the New York Stock Exchange It was also last year that US markets converted to decimal trading an event that did leave a deep market structure impact Decimalisation came as retail trading was already in the throws of a deep downturn Trading spreads collapsed as a result making for even tougher times than many had predicted Now with trading volumes lower profits thinner and a dearth of new listings US traders are looking into a murky future Nasdaq the number two US stock market is several weeks away from launching its new high-powered trading system SuperMontage The system could prove to be its saviour or its undoing US options exchanges meanwhile are bracing for a mandated linkage plan that will only intensify competition between the five rival exchanges Large automated trading platforms known as electronic communications networks ECNs continue to weigh up the pros and cons of merging with each other These are huge bets on technology that may eventually alter the balance among leading US market centres Liquidity tends to follow liquidity and what traders want is faster and less expensive access to buyers and sellers on the other side Critics have long charged that the move towards more technology based trading has not come fast enough but considering the size of trading that occurs every day US markets are adapting to new electronic technologies in real if not overly fast ways The floor based trading model as practised at the New York Stock Exchange the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange shows little sign of ending in the near future but each has spent millions to upgrade systems and provide more electronic access to their floors Most of the dramatic changes however have come from small profit-oriented ECNs For years these ECNs including Island and Instinet have nibbled at the edges of the main US markets but now they are drawing enough liquidity to be considered real threats to the more traditional markets particularly Nasdaq When a gang of fairly new entrants to a market turn heads with their services and attract sizeable liquidity the bigger markets are forced to adapt In a nutshell that is exactly what is happening at Nasdaq as it tries to head off the assaults of the ECNs The result is a patchwork of trading venues in the US The ECNs have not targeted the NYSE but when they do it may be forced to speed up the changes while presumably keeping its core structure centred around its trading floor In spite of the many changes behind the scenes there are real efficiency issues with US trading still to be addressed I'm surprised how much change there has been but are we getting appreciably closer to where we want to go I question it said Robert Schwartz finance professor at Baruch College in New York There are major problems in the handling of institutional order flow and until that's resolved we're not going to have a high quality market for the broader spectrum of participants including retail  Traders often complain of the difficulty in processing large stock trades of 100000-share orders or more The situation has worsened since last year's conversion to decimal trading in the US since average order size has become even smaller in response To avoid having their large orders direct the price of a stock institutions are often forced to break down large blocks into many small orders especially for less liquid stocks that can take days to make their way through the market The only other choice is shopping a large trade with other institutions in the upstairs or third market a move that risks exposing details of a trade to other institutions Some believe the way large institutional stock orders are broken up and traded can create its own negative momentum Word of a large number of small trades coming to market often leaks out causing others to take a position and overeact since they don't know when the many small trades of the stock will end The result can be that prices are taken to unrealistic levels since once the momentum starts it is difficult to stop Ironically it is often small investors who stand to lose most from such arrangements Large institutional trades caught in this large-block bind include those who trade for pension and mutual funds and pools made up of investments of retail investors who may not get the best price for their trades One company looking to provide a solution to and make money from the problem is Liquidnet a private electronic platform Launched early last year Liquidnet offers its services to buy-side firms looking anonymously to find other parties to trade large blocks of shares without intermediaries or information leaks If more institutions use such outside-the-market technologies dislocations caused by large orders could be reduced It remains to be seen how strong a following Liquidnet has and whether it will have the impact its supporters suggest If Liquidnet is not the solution others will surely give it a try As the ECNs proved outsiders can still have a big impact on the structure of US trading ,2
2002-04-16, More companies are defaulting on their debt than ever before and the rate of credit downgrades is at its highest since the early 1990s In this environment investors are increasingly looking to protect their exposure to the credit markets and credit derivatives have become one of the favoured means of doing so The number of investors using these instruments ranging from single-name default swaps to complicated portfolio trades is growing rapidly The exact size of the market is hard to gauge as trading is over-the-counter rather than exchange-based but Risk magazine's latest survey estimated that the total notional amount of outstanding credit derivative contracts had reached almost $1400bn a two-thirds increase on the previous year's survey We expect a massive growth in credit derivatives in the foreseeable future said Matteo Mazzocchi head of credit derivatives and securitisation at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Dresdner like many investment banks is expanding its credit derivatives team to meet the increased demand for credit hedging After the rapid demise of Enron last year liquidity in the bond markets dried up but credit derivatives continued to trade This helped liquidity in the debt markets return faster than it would otherwise have done since default swaps the standard contracts used in the credit derivatives market allow players to go long or short credit with a flexibility that bonds do not always provide After the difficult credit markets we witnessed in 2001 the popularity of credit derivatives products is helping the bond markets to rally and eliminate previous disequilibria said Mr Mazzocchi This liquidity is one of the qualities of the credit derivatives market that has drawn more users There is also an increasing awareness that Enron's business partners who hedged their Enron exposure before the problems were revealed considerably reduced their losses If banks had not had access to the credit derivatives market they would have made heavy losses after Enron collapsed said Sanjeev Gupta head of developed markets credit derivatives at Credit Suisse First Boston Banks continue to be the main users of credit derivatives but a wider range of companies have became aware of the dangers of credit exposure and are increasing buying protection against credit events This is one of the reasons why although Enron was a big player in the derivatives market its collapse has brought new users to the market and volumes have held up According to Mr Gupta the Enron collapse was just the most recent test for default swaps Their resilience when bond market liquidity dried up last November showed credit derivatives contracts worked how they should to help investors hedge their exposure Default swaps are also more in demand when the global economy is depressed Since they offer a form of insurance against corporate default they tend to be more heavily traded in bearish markets when company creditworthiness is undermined as was the case after Enron Although there have been some concerns about the volatility that instruments such as credit derivatives can inject into debt markets this does not seem to have slowed their advance Three months after Enron the market is larger than ever before and still growing as credit derivatives seem to have met the most recent tests and are changing rapidly to meet new demands In the next few months Mr Mazzocchi expects an increased focus on innovation and new products The flexibility of credit derivatives is key In certain areas of structured finance such as CDOs collateralised debt obligations the use of synthetic solutions is becoming increasingly fashionable he says This fosters structural innovation and creates almost endless variations and possibilities to the types of deals marketed We now spend a lot of our time developing these new products for clients ,2
2002-06-21, The new issues pipeline was hit by news that Deutsche Post the German mail operator decided to postpone the roadshow for its debut benchmark bond deal worth {XEU}1bn which it intended to place on the market in the coming weeks The roadshow was postponed after the European Commission on Wednesday confirmed it would have to pay back {XEU}572m to the State of Berlin after it used the state aid to subsidise some of its lossmaking businesses Bankers now expect the deal which carries an Aa3 rating by Moody's Investors Service to happen either in July or September The delay comes after the Italian and French mail operators Poste Italiane and La Poste issued debt close to {XEU}1bn earlier in the week Yesterday the primary markets were dominated by a {XEU}500m bond issued by Dow Chemical the second-largest chemical company in the US It was the third euro-denominated bond issued by Dow Chemical which has been seeking to diversify its investor base by turning to the European markets The five-year notes were priced to yield 85 basis points above swaps which was at the wide end of the price talk Robert Whiccello on the syndicate desk at BNP Paribas one of the bond's joint bookrunners said Market conditions are very difficult so the fact we were able to get the deal done within the range shows the strength of the name  Dow Chemical debt is rated single A by Standard and Poor's and one notch lower by Moody's at A3 The company is expected to use the proceeds of the bond for general corporate purposes In terms of upcoming deals Knorr-Bremse a Munich-based company which is the world's leading maker of rail and truck brakes is expected to tap the international capital markets for the first time by issuing bonds worth {XEU}150m-{XEU}200m The price in the offering for which Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein are the lead banks is expected to be set next week The family-owned company has become the latest in a series of private Mittelstand mid-sized German groups to use the bond markets to finance growth Others in recent years to use this financing method include JM Voith a maker of paper production equipment and Claas Europe's biggest manufacturer of combine harvesters ,1

2002-04-01, By winning more than 19 per cent of the vote in elections in the city state of Hamburg last September Germany's clumsily named Party for a Law and Order Offensive confounded the sceptics who said the untried group would not be taken seriously To prove the party he founded is more than a one-town protest movement Ronald Schill wants to try again In elections this month in Saxony Anhalt one of Germany's most economically depressed states he is aiming for 20 per cent Even nearing that target would be a massive boost for an organisation that did not exist a few months ago It would also represent a significant tremor in national politics Although Mr Schill has stepped back from contesting September's federal elections his party intends to fight every state poll from now on Next month will see the establishment of a branch in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern another depressed eastern state going to the polls later this year If the bandwagon really starts rolling the Schill party could go nationwide sooner than expected Opponents remain dubious about the durability of Mr Schill a former magistrate dubbed judge merciless because of his no-tolerance rulings An early opinion poll in Saxony Anhalt gave his group less than 2 per cent support But matters may be moving the party's way Backing had doubled by the most recent survey Even 4 per cent is a serious underestimate claims Ulrich Marseille the millionaire businessman seconded by Mr Schill to spearhead the campaign Mr Schill could hardly have chosen a more striking or controversial figure Conspicuous for his height and his mop of centre-parted white hair Mr Marseille 40 exudes energy and confidence The opinion surveys don't begin to do us justice he boasts A lot of people support us but don't say so Just wait  Bravado aside Saxony Anhalt has a reputation for backing mavericks in the previous polls the ultra-right Deutsche Volksunion gained nearly 13 per cent of the vote before breaking apart in parliament Rather than the DVU's xenophobia and racism Mr Marseille's message rests on reviving the moribund economy of Saxony Anhalt a nondescript state of 2 6m lacking historical identity and hit particularly badly by the economic collapse of the former German Democratic Republic or East Germany Its plethora of big collectivised industries notably chemicals left its leaders with massive structural problems after re-unification In spite of some prestige projects notably the revived chemicals and refining at Buna and Leuna employment even at the new investments is a fraction of former levels The state's average unemployment rate of about 21 per cent is the highest in Germany Mr Marseille plays on his track record as a businessman to restore Saxony Anhalt's fortunes The government doesn't know how to deal with investors bankers or entrepreneurs You've got to have the right people doing the job he says His first goal is to unseat the minority Social Democrats who hold power through the tacit agreement of the former communist Party of Democratic Socialism and install a new coalition composed as in Hamburg of Christian Democrats and Schill party representatives Mr Marseille would run a combined finance and economics ministry if successful The first priority will be to change Saxony Anhalt's image he says singling out Reinhard Hoppner the state's competent but colourless SPD premier The SPD acknowledges Saxony Anhalt's difficulties in emulating the relative success of eastern neighbours such as Saxony and Thuringia which have attracted significant foreign investment But they argue the problem lies in the state's unpropitious background and its deep transitional problems rather than policies or personalities Critics also question Mr Marseille's motives With his main business locked in a legal battle with the state government over subsidies allegedly promised but not paid some suggest Mr Marseille's passion for politics rests more on his wish to secure a settlement than to govern Saxony Anhalt While Mr Marseille's drive has impressed voters appear to share the uncertainty about his motives But with Saxony Anhalt's reputation for backing fringe movements no one is writing off the Schill party quite yet www ft com/germany2002,3
2002-04-27, Were it to come from a public company it would be a profits warning to set analysts' alarm bells ringing In the case of MG Rover owned by directors dealers and workers a dismissive acknowledgement by Kevin Howe chief executive that break-even targets will be missed will serve only to heighten uncertainty over the future of a car company that employs more than 6000 in the West Midlands Only with a shareholders' statement in June is it likely to become clearer whether MG Rover bought by a group of Midlands businessmen from BMW for a token £10 two years ago is defiantly waving or drowning To listen to Mr Howe MG Rover is racing towards a secure future after being jettisoned two years ago with a £520m cash legacy from BMW of Germany But some industry observers remain sceptical Sterling's strength and MG Rover's heavy reliance on a UK components base its lack of purchasing muscle and other resources will eventually prove a lethal cocktail say critics If Mr Howe has qualms he hides them well Speaking at the modernised Longbridge site within which all MG Rover's activities have been grouped he insists that reports of MG Rover's likely death have been greatly exaggerated Nor does he appear to attach much importance to the shareholder statement's expected disclosure of a £170m loss for last year That is a huge improvement on the £500m of the final year under BMW but still well short of the £100m originally hoped thanks to sterling proving stronger than expected says Mr Howe Hopes of breaking even for this year as a whole have been dashed Mr Howe says he now expects the group to start breaking even towards the year-end According to last year's shareholders' statement MG Rover began its first full year of independence in 2001 with net cash of £329m including £200m drawn down on BMW's legacy Mr Howe insists that over the past year net cash has increased further without using more BMW funds despite £130m-plus spending on new models He also dismisses speculation that MG Rover is struggling to maintain sales This is despite the company's large cars line working at 70 per cent of single shift capacity and total annual sales of about 170000 units a year falling short of an intended 200000 Some of us have been offered big job lots of cars at discounts of up to 30 per cent according to one franchised dealer group speaking on conditions of anonymity Mr Howe denied the assertion He lists a string of company positives  Last month MG Rover signed a far-reaching collaboration deal with China Brilliance the Chinese automotive group which says Mr Howe will lead to jointly developed new models and economies of scale sufficient to ensure a secure niche for both in the global market  It has launched swiftly a family of MG models drawing in younger buyers with more due in the next year including a super car likely to spearhead MG Rover's return to North America  It has bought from BMW the nearby Powertrain engine manufacturing operations securing its own engine supplies and as a potential profit centre supplying engines to its joint venture partner China Brilliance  It has given credibility to its MG brand with giant-killing performance in touring car racing and Le Mans sports car racing But the Chinese deal is pivotal Critics say China Brilliance may be biting off more than it can chew in terms of resources that there may be conflicts of interest with other projects such as one to assemble BMWs under licence and that there may be difficulties acquiring Chinese government production approvals Mr Howe retorts that MG Rover's deal is a strategic partnership covering every aspect of the automotive business and to which China Brilliance will give absolute priority MG Rover's new medium-sized car due in 2004 is likely to be made by both companies and the 2005 replacement for the Rover 25 small car will be of joint development and manufacture Both parties have already put funding into the venture which may also see a China Brilliance-based people carrier added to MG Rover's own range and cars produced for China Brilliance at Longbridge Will it all work Garel Rhys director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University is increasingly positive that it will and that by 2006 production could be well above 300000 It is likely that MG Rover will see a loss of £30m not break even this year But £30m is not going to undermine their prospects  Mr Rhys adds Assuming that the new medium car is a success    then a £110m profit is not unreasonable for 2004 and 2005 could be even better Overall I can't see anything happening to stop them surviving through to 2007 After that who knows,1

2002-06-14, Japan could be bankrupt in 10 years unless it raises taxes one of the top financial advisers to Junichiro Koizumi prime minister has warned Hiromitsu Ishi chairman of Japan's tax commission and the most senior adviser on tax issues to Mr Koizumi yesterday told the FT that tax cuts implemented between 1988 and 2000 were excessive Those cuts meant Japan now had the lowest tax burden of any G7 nation at a time when tax revenues were being undermined by the country's economic decline Mr Ishi will meet Mr Koizumi today to present full details of his suggested revenue neutral changes to the tax system These involve broadening both the income tax and corporate tax bases as well as changes to consumption tax and inheritance taxes They are only one of three sets of recommendations Mr Koizumi will receive Mr Ishi's tough and politically unpalatable message will sit unhappily with the upbeat news Masajuro Shiokawa will present at the G8 finance minister's meeting this weekend where he will seek to allay international concerns over Japan's economic future Japan's tax revenues will drop to Y46800bn {XEU}397bn £257bn this fiscal year compared to a peak in 1990 of Y60100bn At the same time the government's general account expenditure will rise to Y81200bn this fiscal year compared to Y69300bn in 1990 While the government has financed the deficit with bond issues in the past these now account for a third of all government spending At the end of last month to the fury of the Japanese government Moody's Investors Service downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating by two notches Japan's commitment to cap bond issues at Y30000bn this year and maintain fiscal prudence means tax rises are inevitable Mr Ishi said He added that the demographic pressure stemming from Japan's ageing population and declining number of tax payers plus a rising debt service burden would add to the pressure to increase taxes The G8 meeting comes at a time of unprecedented interest in Japan's fiscal position as a result of the Moody's downgrade and the Ministry of Finance's criticism of that decision ,3

2002-06-03, Funds of hedge funds control a fifth of the US hedge fund market and have been growing at just under 40 per cent a year since 1999 according to a study by US consultants Casey Quirk & Acito and Hennessee Group The study is the first to quantify the hedge fund market's size The figures were compiled from Hennessee's annual survey of hedge fund managers At the start of this year there were 1500 funds of funds overseeing assets of $114bn £78bn according to Hennessee It puts the size of the overall hedge fund market at $563bn The survey indicates that funds of funds' assets grew 45 9 per cent between 1987 and 2002 and 39 9 per cent over the past three years However funds of funds' market share has not grown consistently Before 1994 they were heavily concentrated in global macro funds such as Soros Fund Management Moore Capital and to a lesser extent Tiger Management Those funds suffered in 1994 when a series of steep interest rate increases pummelled the bond market After that investors' faith in funds of funds which aim to reduce risk through diversification was shaken Funds of funds experienced their only year of capital outflows in 1995 when the hedge fund market as a whole contracted In 1998 the near collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and the ensuing collapse of the bond market hurt funds of funds Until recently high net worth individuals made up 80 per cent of hedge fund investment but the number of institutional investors market has been increasing Casey Quirk & Acito a group of consultants who were formerly with Barra Strategic Consulting Group have written a study calling for consolidation in the funds of funds market The consultants argue that institutions will demand far higher standards than individual investors Consolidation among funds of funds has increased The UK's Man Group recently purchased RMF a Swiss fund of funds with $8 5bn under management and also this month Unicredito the Italian bank bought Momentum Asset Management of the UK ,1
2002-06-05, From Arlene McCarthy MEP Sir The European Commission is to be congratulated for its initiative on better regulation Prodi in drive for increased scrutiny of EU legislation June 4 As the European parliament's rapporteur on the green paper on consumer protection I have received as a result of the Commission's consultation a large number of representations from stakeholders It is unfortunate that not all these consultations are widely available on the Commission website and that many have yet to be translated into all 11 languages of the European Union To give the Commission its due in the light of these new proposals on better regulation and as a result of business demands it has accepted that it must engage in further consultations with businesses before turning the green paper into a fully fledged directive on a EU duty to trade fairly Additionally impact assessments will reveal the cost to business in particular small to medium-sized enterprises of any new laws in this area Of course the Commission initiative on better regulation will raise more questions than answers To name a few what is an adequate consultation period who should be consulted whether impact assessments should be carried out in-house or by independent evaluation agencies whether co-regulation self-regulation or codes of conduct should take the place of legislation what role framework legislation could play in delivering the same results There are clear benefits if the Commission gets this initiative right Good impact assessments could save significant amounts of EU taxpayers' money Good clear simple legislation could mean fewer cases in the European Court of Justice and could result in laws that are easier to enforce in the member states But there is a bigger prize A recent Eurobarometer poll showed that while 61 per cent of Europeans had confidence in the EU nearly the same percentage felt that they did not understand how it worked The EU Convention on the Future of Europe should now seriously scrutinise these Commission proposals with a view to using them to reconnect people to the political and decision-making process and at the same time to reduce red tape and bureaucracy Arlene McCarthy Labour Spokesman on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market European Parliament B 1040 Brussels Belgium,3

2002-04-11, There has been something of a row this week over my decision to appoint executive directors to strengthen the integration of policy and service delivery in London The expressions of surprise represent a first realisation of the consequences of introducing a new form of government an executive mayoralty So far Britain has had two governance models the local government committee system and the government minister and permanent civil servant An executive mayoralty is neither In the US a mayor directly appoints key executive heads combining these with technical specialists to form an administration The Greater London Authority Act envisages the same by allowing the mayor to appoint directly 10 executive heads to any post in the authority including management of staff I intend to appoint five executive directors and a chief of staff It has been said these powers are equivalent to allowing a minister to appoint the permanent head of a civil service This is correct and entirely the point both in substance and legally The purpose of a mayoralty is to allow policy to be integrated and delivered from a single point This is clearly required in London To take one simple example the city is undergoing an expansion of population 600000 in a decade and of jobs without comparison in the rest of Britain One consequence of the growth in employment is the need to embark on a policy of denser and taller office development But these buildings cannot function without a modern and efficient transport system Measures to tackle gridlock on the roads are purposeless without police priorities to enforce them Rapid development of key commercial areas such as the City fringe and Docklands requires large-scale infrastructure projects such as Crossrail The London mayoralty has extensive powers in transport planning economic regeneration and police budget-setting even if it does not as yet possess the full range of housing police and fiscal powers of a US mayor To deliver services and policies effectively requires a mechanism that where necessary can bite against entrenched resistance from what are frequently inherently monopolistic providers for example the transport system or police In a private company this clout is secured by hiring and firing In the US system and the GLA Act it is secured by the right to set budgets and to appoint directors These powers would be and will be used by any mayor That is why from the beginning as mayor I have brought the strongest possible management into the GLA The appointment of Bob Kiley former head of transport in New York at the highest salary in the UK public sector is the most visible example of an entire management approach The formula is to use strong business and managerial skills to deliver economic efficiency and to use the resources thereby generated to create a better quality of life for the city This approach is already delivering results in areas where the mayor has direct powers Bus travel in London is up 8 per cent in a year London accounts for the entire increase in bus use in the country The target of reversing the decline in police numbers and increasing the force by 1000 officers a year is being achieved The introduction of congestion charging is proceeding The initial outline of the Spatial Development Strategy the main planning guidelines for the city for the next 15 years received an 85 per cent favourable response rate when sent for consultation Construction and planning of the new Underground lines the East London line and Crossrail have already started However it takes time to crank up service delivery fully to the level required When the GLA was created it had scarcely 100 staff After two years of building the structures of London's new form of government it is now possible to pass to a much stronger and more coherent system of service delivery That is why I have taken the necessary steps this week to strengthen integration of policy and service delivery across the whole GLA and its functional bodies This combines the use of my statutory powers of appointment with the further integration of transport and economic regeneration The results are undoubtedly a sharp break with the traditional model of local government in the UK Hence the culture shock The occasional and anonymous accusations of bullying are not of specific incidents on which I would clamp down strictly Rather it is that service delivery units are required to respond to policies set by an elected mayor But it is through their choice of mayor that London's voters and consumers ensure that public services reflect their priorities and needs I have no doubt that this model combining democratic accountability and strong management as in the US will be followed by any future London mayor The writer is mayor of London,3
2002-04-10, The French electorate appears distinctly unimpressed by the presidential elections Some blame the lack of new faces others the unhealthy effects of co-habitation between a Socialist prime minister and rightwing president My analysis of the apathy is quite different however It is born of the candidates' refusal to admit that France's president like its government and parliament now exercises only limited powers With politics so constrained full clear and precise manifestos cannot be presented Much of the blame is laid at the door of the European Union The souverainistes want more power handed back to member states The Europhiles demand more and directly elected EU institutions Then there are those who call themselves pragmatists who allow European affairs to slide into mediocrity and obscurity But Europe is only part of the story The more pressing issue is that globalisation is on the march and the challenge for France is no longer to fight it but to control it manage it and even to civilise it The world is indisputably dominated by America not only materially technologically and militarily but also intellectually Anglo-Saxon concepts awkwardly adapted for other countries now pervade their structure and their sensibilities For proof of America's pre-eminence look how the dollar continues to dominate the global economy in spite of the huge US balance of trade deficit European central bankers may be unable to grasp the point but the US rightly or wrongly is widely regarded as the safest most productive country in the world So are French voters right to conclude that little of significance is at stake in the election Absolutely not But if responsible decisions are to be made the candidates must be candid That means answering one simple question given the constraints of globalisation what kind of society should France become The candidates should have the courage to explain that their difficulty in drawing up a manifesto like many of the problems voters encounter in everyday life stems from the fact that France is part of a world economy dominated by Anglo-Saxon beliefs Which of the candidates will dare say that the real choice for France is not whether it should abandon its vision of the future but how to find a happy balance an equilibrium that is not too costly in economic or social terms Who will dare to tell the electorate that ever greater individual protection resistance to change excessive taxation and national insurance and the removal of responsibility from individuals and decision-makers will damage the sort of civilised society France wants Spending on research and innovation in France is below that of its main competitors Its productivity growth rate is routinely below half that of the US because to the French higher productivity means job losses while to Americans it means greater prosperity for society as a whole It is about time that the French recognised that by working less starting a career later and finishing it earlier they deprive fellow citizens of a better chance to improve their standards of living There is a responsible debate to be had across a range of issues As an example consider just one the debate over tax and the relationship between receipts and public spending Reducing income tax is possible necessary and fair The current burden not only for the well off but for those on middle incomes is excessive It has been shown time and again that it leads to the closing down of jobs-creating businesses the relocation of others and even an exodus abroad of skills and talents France has the best civil service in the world and the best health service Officials must review the structures organisation and procedures of both central and local government as has already happened in the private sector More than half of all French people pay income tax and no one would argue that half the population is too wealthy Moreover income tax is hardly the only progressive tax There are also heavy far too heavy duties on inheritances even though these legacies usually comprise no more than the simple savings from a lifetime's hard work Social solidarity is necessary and comes in part from government spending on the army the police the courts schools and universities or the families old people and the vulnerable who receive state benefits But there are clear dangers in overtaxing savings France is not the US It cannot rely forever on foreign investment and so its national savings must pay for its current needs as well as its economic development investment in capacity and productivity research and innovation both civil and military Now is the time to address these issues France is starting to fall so far behind that it is in danger of never being able to catch up with the US The writer is a former chief executive of Peugeot  www ft com/france2002,3
2002-06-14, Royal Bank of Scotland hit the acquisition trail again yesterday with the $273m £187m purchase of Medford Bancorp a small Massachusetts savings bank The acquisition indicates the willingness of Fred Goodwin chief executive to continue expanding aggressively in the US even as the integration of Mellon Financial bought for $2 1bn in November is under way Simon Samuels banks analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said All the signs are that the Mellon deal is being executed quicker than originally expected There is a reasonable prospect that they will be buying again aggressively in this market as soon as they find something  Larry Fish head of RBS's Citizens division in the US is a serial acquirer of small banks but after Mellon was expected to pause for breath He said yesterday Medford Bank has a highly respected franchise  Medford traded on the Nasdaq exchange has 19 branches in Massachusetts and $1 1bn of deposits The agreed $35 a share offer is at a 19 per cent premium to the price before the deal was made public although the shares had rallied strongly in previous weeks Arthur Meehan chairman and chief executive of Medford will join the state board of Citizens after the deal completes expected to be in the last quarter Mr Meehan will reap a $9 6m windfall from his 3 5 per cent shareholding in the bank RBS shares fell 55p to £18 80 as the banks sector was hit by interest rate and capital concerns Comment  RBS is back Just over six months after taking control of Mellon the purchase of Medford confirms Mr Goodwin's strategy of trying to expand on the US east coast For RBS it makes sense Citizens has successfully ridden out the depressing market for US banking and the Mellon deal was very good value As rivals Barclays and Lloyds TSB struggle to find a deal in Europe Mr Goodwin's bet on the US gives him plenty of room for expansion outside the restricted British market The only concern is that too much success might go to his head and lead to the bank overpaying to ensure more deals take place Medford is too small to matter but 20 times last year's earnings is a full price even for a bank with a good quality loan book www ft com/banking,1

2002-06-26, When President George W Bush presented his long-awaited vision of a permanent Middle East peace in the rose garden of the White House on Monday his national security team stood behind him in a symbolic tableau of official US unity Colin Powell the secretary of state Donald Rumsfeld the defence secretary and Condoleezza Rice Mr Bush's national security adviser provided a solid visual rebuttal to the suggestion that the administration was not at one on this most thorny issue But the display of unity barely masked the obvious strains at the highest levels of the Bush foreign policy team strains that have once again cast a spotlight on the position of Mr Powell the administration's most visible multilateralist dove and the US policymaker most beloved by governments around the world The central theme of Mr Bush's speech has been under fierce internal administration debate since it was first mooted several weeks ago This speech and the policy behind it is a product of the president's National Security Council principals   it was the most intensive involvement of the principals that I've experienced in the time that I've been here a senior administration official said State Department officials attentive to entreaties by Arab and European governments had wanted it to be seen as the clearest statement yet that the US was willing to engage in the Middle East peace process and that it would do so by offering an achievable and reasonably short path towards Palestinian statehood But conservatives led by Dick Cheney the vice-president are understood to have argued that Mr Bush should do nothing that would seem to reward terrorism and should instead essentially endorse the Israeli position that there could be no US support for Palestinian statehood interim or full as long as Yassir Arafat the Palestinian Authority's president was around It certainly seemed from the text the centrepiece of which was a demand for a change in Palestinian leadership as a condition of US engagement that the conservative view prevailed The reaction of conservatives outside the administration which bordered on the elegiac seemed firm evidence that Mr Powell had lost the argument Mr Bush rose above the morass of diplomatic double-speak and the infighting of his own administration left behind the tired and failed formulas of the past and charted a new course for American foreign policy says William Kristol a persistent and vocal critic of the secretary of state But officials including Mr Powell himself were eager to rebut suggestions that the secretary of state's views had been sidelined Mr Powell said on Monday he had been deeply involved in the drafting of the speech and was fully supportive And yet the denunciation of Mr Arafat certainly seems at odds with what the secretary of state has been arguing for months both inside and outside the administration Whatever the understandable objections from Israel or US conservatives he has said Mr Arafat had to be a part of the dialogue Chairman Arafat is head of the Palestinian Authority and he is recognised whether you approve of it or not as the leader of the Palestinian people he told CNN in April And he will be the leader of the Palestinian people whether he is sitting in Ramallah or whether he is sitting in some exile location in the Middle East or somewhere in Europe  Officials say that does not mean however the secretary of state was overruled this week Instead they argue circumstances changed The suicide bombings in the past two weeks despite repeated demands by Mr Powell that the Palestinian Authority stop them convinced even the secretary of state that Mr Arafat could simply no longer be a party to the process Mr Powell said on Monday it had become essential to create a new dynamic to replace the old dynamic built around Mr Arafat But State Department officials also say that while much of the focus on the speech has been on excluding Mr Arafat the importance of the address went beyond that It spelt out as Mr Powell had wanted a clear progression with a putative timetable towards Palestinian statehood It acknowledged more forcefully than a Republican administration has done before the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people And yet the problem with this is that while holding out the prospect of peace and statehood the Bush speech put one enormous obstacle in the way of its realisation General Powell the steadfast soldier is too loyal to betray anything other than staunch support for his commander-in-chief Mr Powell the tireless diplomat is too dedicated to his task to do anything other than work to make the Bush vision a reality But once again it is hard to take seriously the proposition that in this administration the secretary of state's views have prevailed Editorial Comment Arafat at bay Page 18,3
2002-06-06, Four energy companies accused by US federal regulators of hampering their inquiry into price manipulation in the Californian electricity market yesterday denied wrongdoing saying they had co-operated with investigators and would provide any additional information required Avista Portland General Williams and El Paso Electric were charged with filing incomplete or misleading information to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Ferc which has asked more than 150 energy groups to report whether they engaged in trading similar to Enron which used questionable transactions to inflate prices artificially Ferc threatened to strip the companies of their licences to trade energy on the open market and the shares of the three publicly-traded companies plummeted yesterday on the possibility Williams fell more than 17 per cent to $9 12 while Avista dropped 13 per cent to $12 26 and El Paso was down almost 8 per cent to $13 31 Avista had told Ferc it had not engaged in ricochet type trades transactions that send electricity out of state only to return it at a higher price but earlier this week Ferc said it had uncovered evidence that it had Avista said it was investigating Ferc's evidence Portland Electric which has admitted to making questionable trades insisted it had co-operated fully with Ferc despite the agency's insistence that it thought its wrongdoing was more widespread than the company had admitted Williams which told Ferc it did not know whether it had used the trading schemes and was accused of dragging its feet said it would now deny to investigators that it traded any power in order to manipulate prices El Paso has said it did not knowingly mislead the agency but would correct any inconsistencies in a supplemental filing ,2
2002-06-05, Judging by the number of inquiries from potential franchisees Mail Boxes Etc MBE is a hot name in the franchising world The company has over the past few years received 25000 to 30000 inquiries a year This year James Amos the company's president and CEO says that figure is likely to rise to 35000 We have more interest in MBE than at any time in its history says Mr Amos And that interest has been reflected in the number of units established The San Diego-based company whose services include printing office supplies copying computer hire and postal services was established in 1980 and by 1990 had 1000 franchise locations Now one of the world's biggest franchise operations and a global provider of postal and business services MBE has more than 4500 locations worldwide with master licence agreements covering more than 75 countries We're opening a new branch every 18 to 24 hours says Mr Amos The MBE network generates more than $1 5bn in revenue annually and generates 124m customer visits and ships 40m parcels Driving that has been the rapid development in recent years of the small office and the home office creating armies of business workers and freelance operators in need of access to printers photocopiers and courier services That's the target audience for MBE and the target for a number of folks thinking about a franchising deal says Mr Amos Part of the company's expansion has come through a strategy of establishing non-traditional outlets with MBE units in locations such as airports universities military bases convention centres and hotels With an initial investment requirement of $130000 to $150000 MBE does not represent the cheapest franchise opportunity in the industry However Mr Amos believes what potential franchisees find appealing in the prospect of owning an MBE outlet is access to the company's brand cache This has been enhanced he says by the acquisition in March last year by UPS the transportation services company allowing MBE to explore opportunities in small business services e-commerce and financial services More recently however the economic climate has had a positive impact on the business services segment of the franchising industry Part of it is that we've had a tough economy for a long time and as companies are coming off this dotcom bubble they're outsourcing a lot of their business services says Mr Amos The downturn is also creating a growing pool of potential franchisees for the company to tap into People are being downsized and in many instances are coming away with some severance money that can be used to start a new business he says But Mr Amos points out that people come from an extremely wide variety of backgrounds 60 per cent of its franchisees are college educated and 20 have graduate degrees Beyond that we have people that come from all avenues of the economy he says We get a lot of franchisees pursuing second and third careers Then there's the baby boom generation looking at retirement and wanting to stay active that augurs well for the franchising industry  Sarah Murray,1

2002-06-14, Carrefour Carrefour was beginning to look like an exquisite foie gras that had passed its sell-by date But having underperformed the shares of its European peers for almost two years the top-rated French food retailer has suddenly become flavour of the month The 20 per cent out- performance since early May reflects hopes that it can move on after the ill-judged Promode`s merger stop acquiring second-rate international assets and drive sales via old-fashioned price cuts a` la Tesco Yesterday's trading update sought to whet investors' appetites further Hypermarket sales in France excluding petrol outperformed the French retail trade body's index by 2 3 points in April and May an improvement on the first quarter There may be a bit of World Cup fever in there Sadly for a sponsor of the French team that will be short-lived Going forward there is a questionmark over South America's so far resilient performance where it generates 12 per cent of group sales mostly in Brazil and Argentina Carrefour's attractions are strongest on the home front in France Its cash flow benefits from controls on loss leaders new developments and TV advertising Capital expenditure is low and returns on capital high But Carrefour has frittered away that advantage with spectacular negligence during its buying spree while against the odds retaining its premium rating It has its work cut out to prove it will not make the same mistakes again This is time for a nibble of the stock not a big mouthful ,2
2002-04-25, David Secher who arrived two years ago from the Cancer Research Campaign as director of Research Services at Cambridge is working hard to tidy up the university's approach to the commercialisation of intellectual property It is no easy task Many academics remain confused by the system and no wonder Even in the presumably simplified frequently asked questions section on his department's website there are seven different responses to the question Who owns my IP If you begin to dig it is confused to say the least says one entrepreneur who has worked in a Cambridge university spin-out Others go further and criticise a radical change in policy from the laisser-faire days when the university often laid no claim to ownership of intellectual property Pointing out that a successful academic of 40 can still be on a salary of less than £30000 one observer says They don't get paid but at least they used to know that if they suddenly hit on an exploitable patent they might earn some cash by the fruits of their own labour  Cambridge's approach to technology transfer is under scrutiny after a recent attack by John Snyder of the Cambridge Entrepreneurship Centre who highlighted a number of conflicts of interest impeding the creation of successful spin-outs Mr Secher acknowledges that the lack of explicit policy in the past on IP ownership may well have made a highly positive contribution to the so-called Cambridge phenomenon But that worked only in the rare cases where scientists were natural entrepreneurs he argues I am convinced that for every Prof Andy Hopper or Prof Richard Friend there are a dozen scientists with just as good technology but without the entrepreneurial skills or interest  Now against the backdrop of government pressure for universities to smarten up their act on commercialisation he has strengthened the technology transfer office and increased the annual outlay on patenting Last year the university codified its policy on IP rights generated by externally funded research with the effect that in most cases the university owns it Together with the government's University Challenge seed fund and the resources of the Entrepreneurship Centre Cambridge is already creating more effective spin-outs Mr Secher argues and while the academic's share may be smaller the overall pie is more valuable Which sounds fine ex-cept for instance to those who feel they have been bashing their heads against a brick wall in negotiating with the university's middle management on the details of ownership Policy on research not externally funded a relatively minor part of the university's more commercial science Mr Secher claims is also not yet decided although a draft consultation paper is expected shortly More broadly the extent to which the commercialisation process is centralised through the technology transfer office with a standard template for spin-outs along the lines of Isis in Oxford is not clear We are looking at a number of models says Mr Secher One of those is Massachusetts Institute of Technology through the Cambridge-MIT Institute MIT has clear rules on licensing and the business interests of academics But it adopts a hands-off role regarding spin-outs Mr Secher says in Cambridge England where there is a less developed entrepreneurial environment that template cannot be copied Even with all these efforts by all the parties says Doug Richard founder of Cambridge Angels an investor network the whole thing is very complex from the point of view of potential investors Where is the interesting research Where is the intellectual property Who has got it What is its value A few more frequently asked questions still lack easy answers ,3
2002-06-27, Fiat's long-term debt rating was yesterday downgraded to just a notch above junk status after Moody's Investors Services warned that the Italian industrial group's future could hinge on exercising an option to sell its automotive unit by 2004 Moody' s downgraded some {XEU}15bn $14 9bn in Fiat bonds by one notch to Baa3 with a negative outlook However the actions represent a victory for Fiat and its creditor banks which last month scrambled to put together a drastic restructuring and refinancing package to avoid the debt being granted junk status Moody's view could still increase pressure on the Agnelli family Fiat's main shareholder to sell Fiat Auto the vehicle manufacturer it founded in 1899 to General Motors GM acquired 20 per cent of the business in 2000 and Fiat has a put option to sell the remainder between 2004 and 2009 Moody's believes that the exercise of this put option would be a critical feature of Fiat's longer-term operating and financial profile and would provide significant support for sustaining the Baa3 rating the ratings agency said Moody's also recommended that Fiat carry through the restructuring plan's significant asset-sale and debt-reduction plans in order to avoid pressure on the rating and limit the risk of a further downgrade People who worked on the restructuring plan said Moody's actions were in line with expectations following numerous discussions with the ratings agency during the plan's elaboration Fiat shares yesterday fell 1 7 per cent in line with the Italian market The negative outlook represents the execution risk for Fiat The comment on Fiat Auto reflects that unit's losses but if it improves according to plan the exercise of the put is not a given said one person familiar with the group Fiat's board is today expected to approve an offer from Mediobanca the Italian investment bank to acquire 35 per cent of Ferrari for {XEU}840m Fiat had agreed with its creditor banks last month to sell part of the sportscar maker on the stock market late this year speeding up by a year plans to float Ferrari Mediobanca's offer however could give Fiat much-needed cash far sooner Under the proposal Fiat could also buy back the stake at the same price within 12 months of the sale Fiat would do so if Ferrari's valuation increased substantially and it believed it could float Ferrari for more money Mediobanca's offer values Ferrari at around {XEU}2 4bn at least 20 per cent more than the most optimistic current valuations Analysts believe Ferrari could be worth Mediobanca's offer in a year or two if it successfully markets its Maserati brand cars in the US They began selling early this year See Lex,2
2002-06-01, Ericsson the troubled Swedish telecoms equipment maker has promised to re-examine its controversial share voting system in a move to quell protests from institutional shareholders The announcement comes less than a week before the company is to ask an extraordinary shareholders meeting for approval to launch a record SKr30bn $3bn rights issue At present A shares in Sweden's industrial flagship have 1000 times the voting rights of B shares This allows two groupings based around Investor the investment vehicle of the Wallenberg family and Industrivarden an investment company linked to Svenska Handelsbanken to control around 80 per cent of the votes with just 8 4 per cent of the capital If the reform is approved the two groups will almost certainly no longer hold a voting majority Among other things this could lead to changes in how the company's much criticised board is made up Ericsson said its major shareholders including Investor and Industrivarden wished to examine how a levelling of the difference in voting rights from a thousand to one to ten to one can be accomplished  Michael Treschow chairman said the most important issues were now the legal conditions compensation to A-shareholders and that the question of voting rights is not mixed up with the ongoing process of the rights offering  In recent years several other leading Swedish companies such as SKF and Electrolux have abandoned the 1000-1 system At Electrolux it happened during the time when Mr Treschow was chief executive However it is far from certain that the reform will be pushed through Ericsson has looked at the issue before and the matter of compensation for the A shareholders is sure to be tricky Tomas Nicolin chief executive of the Third AP Fund a state pension fund which holds just under 1 per cent of Ericsson's capital welcomed the move There are good arguments for differential voting rights in some companies But one has to question if 1000-1 is optimal ,2
2002-06-27, Serono Europe's largest biotechnology company yesterday tabled its first ever takeover bid offering {XEU}107m $106m in cash to buy Genset once a flagship of the French biotechnology sector The size of the acquisition surprised analysts who had been expecting a larger purchase and in the US Geneva-based Serono has been looking for ways to deploy its $1 5bn of net cash for the past two years However people close to Serono stressed that US acquisitions were still very much on the cards Genset has struggled since February last year when its credibility among investors suffered a serious blow with the abrupt departure of the scientist responsible for Famoxin an obesity treatment following a dispute with management about the presentation of trial results The development of Famoxin was Genset's clearest attempt at demonstrating that it could come up with own products rather than focusing on gene research for other pharmaceutical companies The deal also highlights the financial difficulties of smaller biotech companies which have to invest heavily in research and development at a time when funding has virtually dried up Insiders said that Genset which has a {XEU}55m convertible bond maturing next year would have needed to raise additional funds within nine months Serono controlled by Ernesto Bertarelli 36 a Swiss billionaire who hopes to win next year's America's Cup is one of Europe's most successful biotechnology companies However its success until now has rested largely on the cash flow from infertility drugs where it is the world leader and its future growth is heavily dependent on the successful US launch of Rebif a multiple sclerosis treatment The Genset acquisition will help quell criticism that Serono set up nearly 100 years ago is not a real biotech company Serono will take over a company with good access to French academia at a fraction of the $2bn-plus that Genset was valued at two years ago Genset gives Serono access to a fully integrated genomics drug discovery platform while Genset gets the benefit of Serono's drug development and marketing expertise The acquisition will reduce Serono's net profit by $16m to $17m this year Serono plans to cut about a fifth of the French staff of Genset Serono was advised by JP Morgan Lehman Brothers advised Genset ,2
2002-04-04, Speculation that the equity market might be moving to a war footing sent BAE Systems to the top of the Footsie yesterday The US move away from isolationism and the the increasing turbulence in the Middle East increased yesterday as Egypt cut government ties with Israel The UK company generates more than a third of its profits from the US Defense Department and would be a prime beneficiary of any military build up Coupled with that is the increasing attractiveness of the stocks to US investors since the UK government lifted its foreign ownership ban The change is expected to be ratified at the beginning of May but BAE said yesterday that overseas buying above the existing 49 per cent level would not be stopped in the interim even though overseas ownership had risen above 50 per cent The shares had been trading at a slight discount to their US peers and the rise of 13 to 354p on volume of 28m was said to be largely because of US buying Finally the release of the latest report and accounts persuaded some analysts that the strategy remained in place in spite of the surprise dismissal recently of John Weston the chief executive Shell Transport dropped back as the market examined its offer for Enterprise Oil and the prospect that it might go further down the acquisition trail Merrill Lynch said it was unable to find any compelling reasons for the Enterprise deal but JP Morgan was more optimistic and said that it could provide synergy benefits of 200p a share which would lift the broker's net asset valuation to 800p There has also been speculation that Shell might be poised to take on BG Group Shell shares fell 8 to 520p even though Merrill raised its 2002 oil forecast by almost $2 a barrel to $20 50 in the belief that Opec's compliance was eroding inventories faster than expected as well as the improving economic outlook and mounting tension in the Middle East Enterprise drifted off 4 to Shell's 725p offer price and BP gained a penny to 625p SAB falls on US talk Shares in South African Breweries fell on press reports that the brewer is in talks to acquire US beer group Miller from Philip Morris for about $5bn which would make it the world's second-largest brewer Analysts pointed out that shareholders may not be happy if such a deal were to go ahead It all depends on the price Two weeks ago it was rumoured to be $6bn but now it's $5bn which makes a little more sense said one analyst Moving into areas of hard currency might lessen SAB's exposure to the weak rand but such a move could be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire given the company's flagging fortunes he said Other analysts were more positive on a possible deal which they thought could be earnings-enhancing in an industry which is rapidly consolidating Shares gained 2 to 495p after falling on the news in earlier trading Shares in Belgian brewer Interbrew lost 0 3 per cent to {XEU}32 on the speculation that SAB could be in talks to take over Miller

2002-06-11, Instinet the US electronic trading system that is 83 per cent owned by Reuters is acquiring Island its main rival in an all-stock deal valued at $508m £348m The move is a challenge to the dominance of the Nasdaq stock market in US electronic trading Together Island and Instinet account for about 21 per cent of all trading in Nasdaq-listed stocks second only to Nasdaq itself Analysts said the Island deal would allow Reuters to focus more on its core business The two companies left many details of how their businesses would be combined to be worked out after the deal is completed They have different customers for example with Instinet used mainly by large institutions and Island more focused on retail trades Revenues at Island last year were $166m far short of Instinet's $1 5bn Although most analysts saw the deal as broadly positive for Reuters the media group's shares fell 6p to close yesterday at a new low of 431p The stock has more than halved in the past 12 months as the group suffered in the fall-out from Instinet's weakening performance and spending cuts among its core financial services clients Richard Hitchcock media analyst at Numis the investment bank said For Instinet it strengthens its hand and provides some potential synergies For Reuters it means that one of its subsidiaries which has not been performing well will be under less pressure but it doesn't solve all its problems overnight  Ed Nicoll Island chairman will be chief executive of the merged company while Mark Nienstedt Instinet acting chief executive will become president and chief financial officer Instinet will issue about 77m shares to Island's owners which include private equity groups TA Associates Bain Capital and Silver Lake Partners Island shareholders will own about 25 per cent of Instinet Reuters' stake will be about 62 per cent As part of the deal which is expected to close in the second half of this year Instinet will pay a cash dividend of $1 a share to shareholders Analysts said the $207m that Reuters will receive as its share of the special dividend was welcome but of only limited significance Instinet stock rose 5 cents to close at $7 10 in New York Peter Martin Page 23 Lex Page 24 Agreement slims advantage Page 32 www ft com/internet,2
2002-06-12, Wagon has completed its transformation from a conglomerate to a specialist automotive engineer by agreeing to sell its storage systems division for £60m It is the third large non-core business offloaded by Nick Brayshaw in his five years as chief executive Mr Brayshaw has turned Wagon into an engineer focusing on making large vehicle structures often out of the lightweight metals Whittan Investments a private equity group is to buy the division whose products include metal racking for warehouses Proceeds will be used to reduce net debt from £91 6m to £36 6m cutting gearing from near 100 per cent to about 25 per cent This will make it easier for Wagon to fund expansion including building two factories expected to produce parts for Jaguar and Peugeot Leamington-based Wagon will make an exceptional profit of £15m on selling the storage systems unit Divisional sales of £126m account for more than a fifth of the total for the company while operating profits of £9 1m represent a third of the group figure Wagon announced that group profits after tax had fallen from £19 6m to £17 8m in the year to March 31 as turnover grew from £491 2m to £510 9m The dividend for the year was held at 13 5p payable from earnings per share of 21 3p 23 7p Comment  Yesterday Mr Brayshaw promised healthy growth in sales over the next three years with margins either flat or rising This is a coy way of saying profits and dividends should increase The claim is underpinned by new contracts won on the back of Wagon's skills in handling lightweight materials such as aluminium Mr Brayshaw deserves credit for fostering these and creating a viable business out of a small muddled conglomerate However the shares fell 3p to 215{1/2}p yesterday reflecting scepticism as well as dilution worries Mr Brayshaw badly needs to deliver the cure-all of steadily rising profits in Wagon's core business to revive the share's prospective p/e This is languishing at 10 times against multiples closer to 13 for other mid-cap engineers ,2
2002-06-05, Since Paul Myners unveiled a blueprint for change in institutional investment for the UK last year the repercussions have continued to ripple through the pension and fund management industries The review by the former fund manager at Gartmore sponsored by the UK government has become a landmark for industry reform The reforms proposed take in such issues as shareholder activism easing minimum funding levels disclosure of transaction costs and improving investment decision-making by pension fund trustees Mr Myners described as a poacher turned gamekeeper by some in the industry declared in his review that he was seeking genuine behavioural change and establishing a more rational considered framework for decision-making in institutional investment One of the most controversial proposals has been to end the so-called soft commission relationship between fund managers and broking houses This practice involves brokers providing fund managers with services ranging from specialised research to Reuters terminals in return for their custom Mr Myners says the system lacks transparency and the costs of such services are passed on to clients in commission payments to brokers Instead he recommended that commission costs should be lumped in with the investment management fee making the costs more transparent and giving managers an incentive to economise The fund management industry including Mr Myners' employer Gartmore have criticised the move arguing that it is counter-productive The industry also pointed out that fund managers are judged on their returns after costs charged against the portfolio In addition it was argued that the UK industry would be disadvantaged as soft commissions were widely used in other markets A poll published earlier this year showed that nearly half of the top fund managers still strike soft commission deals with brokers A new industry code in the UK has been drawn up by two UK trade bodies the Investment Managers Association and the National Association of Pension Funds that will require an unprecedented level of disclosure and could set the benchmark for other countries Fund managers will have to disclose policies process and quantative data on costs Specifically they have to disclose any use of soft commissions and justify them In line with a review proposal the government is making a phased abolition of a controversial solvency test for pension funds The Minimum Funding Requirement which came into effect four years ago was a strict test discouraging pensions from indulging in risky assets It will be replaced by a lighter regulatory framework a long-term funding standard for each pension fund underpinned by a regime of transparency and disclosure Another focus is raising the professionalism of pension fund trustees with greater training and clearer delineation of responsibilities Under proposed legislation in line with Myners report proposals trustees would be expected to comply with a new standard of care they would be expected to be familiar with the issues on which they make decisions The Myners report also recommends trustees place greater emphasis on asset allocation and setting clearer objectives to their fund management Another area of proposed legislation is shareholder activism Mr Myners said he was particularly concerned about the value lost to institutional investors by the reluctance of fund managers to seek change at underperforming companies The government has issued a consultation paper on the issue which is currently generating intense industry debate ,3
1998-04-03, A Czech telecommunications group partly owned by Tele Danmark will today announce plans for a $100m international equity offering the first of several telecoms groups from the region hoping to tap foreign investors this year Ceske Radiokomunikace CRK runs most of the Czech Republic's radio and television transmission network and owns 51 per cent of a mobile phone operator It is seeking to complete the offering a rare event for a Czech industrial group before general elections in June that could further complicate Prague's troubled privatisation programme ABN Amro Rothschild will be global co-ordinator for the offering which will be entirely of new shares The Czech state holding company owns 70 per cent of CRK This will fall to 51 per cent when the offering in the form of Global Depositary Receipts has been completed because it is not taking up its share of a rights issue The capital increase will be accompanied by a 10-for-1 share split to make CRK shares more liquid A portion of its shares are listed on the Prague stock exchange and the GDRs will be listed in London Tele Danmark bought a 20 8 per cent stake in CRK last year to gain a foothold in the fast-growing Czech mobile services market The Danish operator had been an aggressive bidder for a licence to set up Radiomobil a second operator that was eventually won in 1996 by CRK and Deutsche Telekom It had earlier lost out to international rivals in bidding for a stake in SPT Telecom the Czech national operator Tele Danmark is thought to have paid Kc4500 a share for the stake and the shares are now trading at about Kc4100 each giving CRK a market value of some $260m ABN Amro estimated last week that up to $16bn worth of telecoms companies were being earmarked for privatisation in central and eastern Europe in the next 18 months Most are national operators that will probably seek strategic partners but Poland's TPSA the biggest in the region is due to be floated later this year ,1
2002-04-18, Call it the pathetic period That time after tax day when we take a deep breath and start glorying over the prospect of a refund Somehow we manage to forget that that refund was our money in the first place Two professors at University of Michigan have come up with an explanation for such tax docility And the fact that one of them is a professor of marketing probably gives the whole story away  Their position is a clear one taxpayers will engage in a very unlovely activity paying taxes because it is made tolerable by that great prettifier of unlovelies clever packaging Consider for starters a process most of readers have just completed collecting deductions When we spend our evening hours wondering about the home office and what about that costly bookshelf that last charitable deduction those stock market losses or how many kids we have we are really cushioning ourselves from the pain of the tax take Every deduction we uncover represents a small consolation This the authors note is exactly why the government does deliver the most painful punch first and then moves to the deductions It's a clever strategy But it is important to remember that it was not always this way when the first income tax form was created in 1913 taxpayers calculated their tax and then reckoned their super tax the extra bit they paid in progressivity Government has learned a lot since then and now plays the deductions game like Tiger Woods And taxpayers have become addicted So much so that going back to the old system of one simple rate and few or no deductions is close to politically impossible as the flat taxers can attest Another way lawmakers and the government trick the taxpayer is by finding ways to quantify taxes so they don't seem so high During the 2000 presidential campaign Al Gore derided George W Bush's tax cut plan on the grounds that the average family would get about enough money to buy one extra Diet Coke a day about 62 cents writes Joel Slemrod an author of the study His framing effort was clear in comparison to referring to the Bush plan as a $1 6 trillion tax cut over 10 years  For European readers the trillion dollar number is particularly frightening since it is larger than the scale of tax cuts that could be written in Europe That of course is true because Europe's economies are not as big as that of the US But few tax debaters on the international scene acknowledge this they just use the T-word to demagogue for the argument that the cut is large Then there is the culture of the refund Tax preparation firms have learned to arbitrage refunds lost by selling fast rebates or instant rebates especially to poorer members of society What they neglect to highlight is that they charge sky-high rates of interest for providing this service at something close to no risk to themselves In other words we treasure our consolation rebate so much that we are willing to pay even more for the pleasure of experiencing it But the largest tax marketing success of the past hundred years is that great beast progressivity Progressivity is so successful in part because most Americans don't understand it People tend to confuse their average rate with their marginal rate Nobody wants to betray ignorance by raising the obvious question is progressivity fair or logical The real Madison Avenue-style genius though was in the term progressivity instead of the old super tax or graduated surcharge Progressivity sounds magnanimous The University of Michigan study provides food for thought on the dangers of the Value Added Tax a system common in Europe but not in the US The clever part of the VAT is that VAT taxes are collected at every stage of production rendering them close to invisible At the end there is no VAT breakout either Most Europeans think a {XEU}5 item is a {XEU}5 item without asking what part of that price is tax If you don't mind being manipulated like a laboratory rat this all may be fine with you But the marketing game has worked so well that it conceals the hidden economic dangers of our illogical tax apparatus These days the big question on the economic table is whether the residential real estate market is overvalued and set for the sort of massive correction equities have seen In tax terms forecaster Brian Wesbury of GKST the Chicago-based broker says the answer would have to be yes That is because homes are about the only area around that are tax-advantaged to the hilt So citizens have invested ie borrowed beyond anything homes' true values can sustain distorting perhaps perilously Alan Greenspan Fed chairman reinforced just this point in his testimony yesterday the bedrock market on which consumer confidence rests And a Happy Tax Season to you too   Behavioural Public Finance Tax Design as Price Presentation by Aradhna Krishna and Joel Slemrod University of Michigan,3
2002-06-19, Jim Schiro the new chief executive of Zurich Financial Services can be forgiven for wondering whether he made the right decision A year ago he was in the running to be the next chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission Now he is in charge of rebuilding the fortunes of ZFS a sprawling Swiss-based financial services conglomerate with 38m customers and 70000 staff which has been buffeted by a series of profit warnings and management upheavals Not only is he the first American to head a Swiss financial conglomerate but his challenge in rebuilding investor confidence at ZFS whose share price remains stubbornly low appears even more daunting than that facing new SEC chairman Harvey Pitt in beefing up the regulator's effectiveness It is much the same story at Swiss Life the country's biggest life insurer which was forced to axe its dividend and like ZFS replace its chief executive after a collapse in earnings that followed a period of rapid acquisition-led growth Many of the problems facing Swiss insurers are no different from those in other countries The overriding problem for all European insurers according to Geneva private bankers Pictet is the continued low investment returns due to weak equity markets and low interest rates The pot of unrealised capital gains which had fuelled earlier profit growth is much reduced This has a knock-on effect on capital adequacy and solvency something which has not gone unnoticed by regulators The UK's Financial Services Authority is conducting a financial health check on nearly a quarter of the UK's 900 insurers But the dramatic underperformance of some Swiss insurers relative to their European peers suggests their problems may be more deep-seated The first issue is size Switzerland a country of 7m people is home to several global companies To satisfy their growth ambitions several have expanded overseas and others have diversified into related areas such as international asset management and private banking Swiss Life's SFr2 4bn $1 5bn acquisition of Banco del Gottardo a Swiss private bank is perhaps the best example of several highly priced acquisitions which are weighing down the balance sheets of some Swiss insurers The second issue is specific to the Swiss life insurance industry Under Swiss government rules occupational pensions schemes have to pay out a minimum 4 per cent well above the yield on Swiss government bonds When equity markets were booming Swiss life insurers could afford to make up the shortfall but this is no longer the case The industry is lobbying the Swiss government to change the rules but as yet with little success For some companies such as Zurich the problem is relatively limited For Swiss Life the market leader it could hold the key to its long-term survival The third issue concerns the general exposure of Swiss insurers to equity markets Swiss Life's equity fell 35 per cent to SFr5bn $3 2bn last year Fox-Pitt Kelton which specialises in insurance stocks estimates its equity exposure at 518 per cent of its shareholders funds In the case of Credit Suisse's Winterthur insurance unit it is 510 per cent At ZFS where shareholders equity fell 14 per cent to $17 7bn the issue is slightly different Investors are worried whether it has been running down its insurance reserves to boost its profits Credit Suisse First Boston CSFB noted in a report that ZFS's loss reserve ratio was 30 per cent below its best competitors ZFS and Swiss Life are both under pressure to raise capital to repair their balance sheets and support their growth CSFB for example estimates that ZFS needs to raise between $1bn and $2bn of capital even without strengthening its reserves The underperformance of the share prices of some Swiss insurers reflects the market's awareness that ZFS Swiss Life and Winterthur will all need to tap the capital markets over the next few months But it also reflects a concern about the particular vulnerability of a handful of well-known Swiss insurers to a prolonged bear market ,2
2002-04-22, Socialist party activists in France let out a howl of anguish at the campaign headquarters of Lionel Jospin last night when exit polls suggested he had been knocked out of the presidential election in the first round by Jean-Marie Le Pen leader of the far-right Front National Mr Jospin the outgoing Socialist prime minister who has headed a coalition government of the left for the past five years was expected to score badly but not so badly that he would fail to meet president Jacques Chirac in the second and final round Within days you will see all the country's democrats taking to the streets said a weeping Morgan Ody a 22-year-old international relations student and Socialist party militant Like most French Socialists she attributed Mr Jospin's failure to the proli-feration of minor candidates and the focus on rising crime in the campaign Mr Jospin's shocked supporters greeted the news of Mr Le Pen's performance with cries of Fascist! and Shame! They booed television appearances not just of rightwingers but also leftist candidates such as Arlette Laguiller the Trotskyist who took votes from Mr Jospin Chirac only talked of law and order which could only mean an extreme right victory said Ms Ody The left was certain that Jospin would win so they allowed themselves to vote for people like Arlette  Michel Broue a member of Mr Jospin's support committee held out only the faintest hope that late results from the big cities would produce an official result in Mr Jospin's favour this morning It's stunning I don't understand what's happened he said In a heated argument with fellow Socialists he burst out I wrote three days that Le Pen was on Jospin's heels and I was treated like an idiot Bloody hell  A glum Dominique Strauss-Kahn a leading Socialist party figure tried to rally the shattered spirits of the party faithful We must prepare the future There is no defeat that irreversible he said in a television interview It's unthinkable that France has the choice only between the right and the extreme right ,3
2002-04-17, The distant sound of rattling tins is emanating from Conservative Central Office Iain Duncan Smith has written an every-little-counts begging letter to party members ahead of next month's local elections producing 1000 key issue leaflets costs £35  They'd better hope it works Observer hears that CCO has just parted company with half a dozen key staff including the personnel manager and the head of the research department's library None is expected to be replaced Personnel matters will now be handled by the department of the director of operations which also runs conferences while staff are rummaging for themselves around the library stacks We're skint an insider bluntly confides Another harks wistfully back to the days before the 1997 general election when money was poured in from donors desperate to avert a Labour government But there was a snag The official goes on Money was given on condition that it was used to fight the election so we wound up spending vast amounts on putting up 100 more posters in Worcestershire that sort of thing We'd love to have saved some of it for rebuilding the party after the defeat ,3
2002-04-10, The Czech government is taking a tougher line about compensating ethnic Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war a move likely to fuel a dispute with the European Union Jan Kavan foreign minister said yesterday his ministry had been considering some kind of symbolic gesture to the Sudeten Germans but this was now out of the question Mr Kavan made his remarks only 24 hours before a planned visit by Gunter Verheugen the EU's enlargement commissioner If we agreed to some compensation it would be our own sovereign decision aimed towards Germans who resisted the Nazi regime and still suffered after the war because they were German Mr Kavan said But we will not do so under pressure not in this atmosphere  Rightwing politicians in Austria Germany and Hungary have grown bolder in their demands for the Czech Republic to abolish the Benes decrees which legitimised the expulsion of 2 5m Sudeten Germans and the seizure of their property before it can join the European Union The European parliament has joined in the criticism of the decrees though so far no government has directly linked their abolition with approving Czech EU membership The dispute has worsened Czech relations with Germany Austria and Hungary In January Milos Zeman the prime minister who faces elections in June called the Sudetens Hitler's fifth column for their role in the Nazi conquest of Czechoslovakia leading Gerhard Schroder the German chancellor to cancel his visit In an interview this week Mr Zeman said he had had to respond to the country's critics and defend the decrees You can't observe these postwar events in the quiet with the eyes of the present he said adding that the expulsions and expropriations were backed by the 1945 Potsdam conference He warned that abolishing the decrees would lead to the unravelling of the postwar settlement Mr Zeman told Aleksander Kwasniewski president of Poland from which even more Germans were expelled that if the Czechs lose you will be next The Czech government fears abolition of the decrees would lead to massive compensation claims and would overturn the property order painfully re-established after the end of communism They cannot be cancelled because they have created certain legal facts said Mr Kavan But they do not create any new legal facts they are obsolete There is no danger they could threaten any EU citizens' property  On Monday during a visit to Prague Tony Blair the British prime minister reiterated that the decrees were not an obstacle to EU accession a position Mr Verheugen is expected to endorse during his visit which starts today For regional reports www ft com/europe,3

2002-06-10, The escalating row over spin saw both main partiesclaim politics was being brought into disrepute yesterday as a poll revealed that more than half the public believed the government was dishonest and untruthful Iain Duncan Smith the Conservative leader launched a savage attack on the government's insensitive crass and stupid tactics in checking the political affiliations of a group representing survivors of the Paddington train crash The whole political process is demeaned when the government plays games with people's lives like this Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC But John Reid the Northern Ireland secretary claimed the real risk to the political process stemmed from a media culture obsessed with froth and personalities Every time I come on a programme to communicate it's regarded as spin every time I criticise a politician it's a government smear every time someone makes a donation to the Labour party it's sleaze Mr Reid told the BBC It doesn't just harm the Labour party it brings the whole of politics into disrepute  The government's evident frustration springs from its inability to lay to rest the political ghost of Stephen Byers Last week the former transport secretary apologised for the e-mail sent by Dan Corry his special adviser to a Labour official asking whether the leaders of the Paddington Survivors Group were Tories Alistair Darling Mr Byers' successor and Mr Corry have also said sorry But the repercussions from the row continue to generate media waves Gwyneth Dunwoody the Labour backbencher yesterday claimed she was the victim of a government-backed whispering campaign to remove her as chair of the transport select committee It's the way they work she told the Independent on Sunday An attempt to oust Ms Dunwoody failed last year after a backbench rebellion but she said This time they will probably succeed  Martin Sixsmith Mr Byers' former press chief aired fresh allegations in yesterday's media claiming he was being put under pressure by the government into signing a gagging clause to prevent him discussing his time in Whitehall before he could get his six-figure severance payment The continuing controversy over allegations of spin and dirty tricks is damaging public confidence in politicians a survey out yesterday suggests Support for Labour has dropped below 40 per cent cutting the lead over the Tories to six percentage points according to a YouGov survey for The Mail on Sunday The poll found that only 1 per cent believed the government was always honest and truthful 46 per cent said it was mostly dishonest and 8 per cent always dishonest ,3
2002-06-14, US retail sales and wholesale prices fell in May at the fastest pace this year according to government reports released yesterday giving the Federal Reserve scope to keep short-term interest rates at 40-year lows to support the economy's shaky recovery The reports buffeted an already embattled US stock market where equity prices fell in early trading and hit the dollar which struggled against the euro and yen The US Commerce Department said retail sales data fell by 0 9 per cent in May their biggest drop since November after a 1 2 per cent jump in April A drop in vehicle sales led the decline but the weakness was broad-based Meanwhile a US Labor Department report showed that wholesale prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 0 4 per cent in May the biggest decline since December This followed a 0 2 per cent fall the previous month suggesting inflation at the retail level will remain subdued Taken together the seasonally adjusted figures reinforced market expectations that the Fed's policy-making open market committee FOMC will maintain short-term interest rates at its June 25 meeting and possibly for the rest of the year Interest-rate futures extended their downwards trend which had earlier been encouraged by this week's release of the Fed's latest beige book economic assessment That assessment a summary of anecdotal evidence from regional Fed offices across the country characterised economic growth in the US as modest and uneven It marked a devaluation from the previous beige-book appraisal which described the economy's overall tone as unambiguously positive In spite of this some analysts caution against the latest outbreak of pessimism in financial markets Ram Bhagavatula chief economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland argued that May's drop in retail sales was marginal after accounting for the reversal of an earlier surge in vehicle sales a drop in gas prices and abnormally cool weather He said the latest round of car discounts weekly sales reports and a recent turnround in the Fed's measure of consumer net worth suggested sales could come in stronger than people expect in the months ahead Supporting that view were revisions from the Labor Department released yesterday showing the total number of Americans on unemployment benefits while near 19-year highs at 3 77m has been falling for four consecutive weeks Demand for jobless benefits have shown a downwards trend over the past two months below the key 400000 mark as job cuts have tapered off from post-September 11 highs Amid all the economic financial and geopolitical uncertainty this year the Fed has since December kept its target for the fed funds rate which regulates overnight lending between banks at 1 75 per cent  US manufacturers hardest hit in last year's recession said yesterday they saw growing signs of an economic turnround but cautioned that the rebound would be moderate AP reports The National Association of Manufacturers the trade group representing 14000 American companies said its members believed growth would increase in the second half ,2
2002-04-09, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton was furious years ago when she first learned that the US Mint was planning a set of 50 quarter-dollar coins commemorating the 50 US states Norton who represents Washington DC as a non-voting delegate had no objection to the series itself but was aghast that her city was to be excluded When the 10-year state-quarter programme began in 1999 Norton reminded a local newspaper that the city's 572000 residents who live in a non-state federal territory already suffer taxation without representation the same grievance that inspired the new republic in 1776 Alas Norton and her constituents were insulted anew last week when the US Postal Service unveiled its Greetings From America series which could well go down as the wittiest stamps the USPS has ever issued The collection created in conjunction with the Travel Industry Association of America takes its cues from the kitschy postcards popular in the 1940s and 50s complete with corny typography and exaggerated tourist draws North Dakota celebrates its wild horses Alabama a brand-new battleship and Kansas true to its stereotype a giant grain harvester Numerous states boast of beaches sailboats skiers and wild animals agrarian Indiana and Oklahoma gamely flaunt big-city skylines  But no stamp for Washington DC nor for four other US territories that have non-voting voices in Congress Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands Norton considers the exclusion an honest mistake I don't think it's political she said last week Still it's the kind of oversight a government agency should be the last to make particularly an agency based in the city that bore the brunt of anthrax terrorism last autumn We had their anthrax problem which no one else had nearly as bad and we had our airport closed for three weeks she said You'd think DC would have been the first thing on the minds of the USPS and the TIA The postal service is contrite about the snub It wasn't a deliberate exclusion at all insisted Don Smeraldi a spokesman It was based on how it's been formatted in the past when the USPS has issued other 50-state stamp sets including state-flag and state-flowers-and-birds From the printing perspective Fifty works well on a pane of stamps he added Happily for Washingtonians the USPS may correct the oversight with belated stamps honouring the non-state US territories Some of our top officials have talked with Norton about it and the USPS is open to additional Greetings From stamps Smeraldi said While the gestation period for US postage stamps can last several years the new series was conceived about five years ago a Greetings From Washington DC stamp might be expedited Smeraldi noted Norton is still fighting to get a state quarter for Washington DC she is optimistic about pending legislation that would allow it and plans to keep pushing for a Greetings From stamp A Washington DC stamp would differ from the originals in one crucial respect however The stamps issued last week cost 34c each At its meeting today the USPS Board of Governors will almost certainly vote to raise first-class rates to 37c on June 30 The increase would render the entire Greetings From America series obsolete after three months in circulation ,3
2002-04-25, An impressive display bythe banks and solid performances by many of the old economy sectors such as food manufacturing utilities and tobaccos came to the rescue of London's equity market yesterday So did GlaxoSmithKline whose shares raced higher in the wake of warmly received first-quarter numbers But the new economy areas and particularly the telecoms had to endure another difficult session with Vodafone widely viewed as the villain of the piece in the FTSE 100's decline in the past couple of weeks only just managing to stave off another decline ahead of today's crucial trading update The oil majors one of the key sectors in the FTSE 100 because of their heavy weightings in the index were also under intense pressure after crude oil prices gave ground in the wake of US inventory news Dealers were not overly impressed with the market's performance however with some pointing out the potential for weakness from various areas including the Middle East situation and the continuing US first-quarter reporting season that still has some way to go There is still plenty of downside firepower left in this market and if Vodafone disappoints there could be plenty of pain for the market said one marketmaker He was surprised at the pace and power of the banks' advance which was spearheaded by Barclays HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland but which encompassed the whole sector The sector's surge came in the wake of several buy recommendations and ahead of annual meetings being held today by Barclays and Abbey National The former is expected to deliver a positive message to its shareholders and have its scrip issue proposal rubber stamped Fuelled by the gains in the banks and other defensive areas plus a decent rally in US markets the FTSE 100 index moved back above the 5200 level to finish a net 27 2 ahead at 5218 2 At its best the index was up 34 3 while at its worst only minutes after the start of the trading session it was down 22 0 at 5169 0 The other main indices were mixed The FTSE 250 was bolstered by the excellent performance of Egg the internet banking group whose shares topped the 250 winners list climbing 9 per cent after strong first-quarter figures Another boost for the midcap index came from the upsurge in shares in the London Stock Exchange which hit a record high amid takeover speculation The FTSE SmallCap was always in the red eventually closing a net 3 3 off at 2602 6 having been as low as 2599 4 The Techmark 100 fell 7 74 to 1103 33 its lowest closing level since hitting a record closing low of 1064 98 on September 21 in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on New York on September 11 Turnover reached 2 5bn shares ,2
2002-06-06, With two weeks to go before Japan's parliament dissolves for the summer the administration of Junichiro Koizumi has started to resemble the dying days of his hapless predecessor Yoshiro Mori whose political demise was characterised by verbal gaffes scandal and an ossified reform process So far this week Mr Koizumi's agenda has been dominated by dealing with the fallout from comments by Yasuo Fukuda chief cabinet secretary who indicated over the weekend that Japan might reconsider its ban on owning nuclear weapons Any such move would mean repealing Japan's landmark 1971 ban on the possession production and import of nuclear weapons Mr Fukuda's comments prompted public outcry and nearly upset the country's hair-trigger relationships with China and South Korea before hasty explanations were issued by the foreign ministry In a manner that harks back to the gaffe-prone Mori regime Mr Fukuda and Mr Koizumi have spent the last two days in a surreal political hinterland insisting that while Mr Fukuda said what he said he did not mean it No changes to the 1971 commitments are being contemplated they said Mr Koizumi who has a reputation for possessing a shrewd political nose and a knack for soundbites has been deserted by his inspiration and forced to resort to a Mori-esque defence This whole thing has been blown out of proportion he said The confusion at the very top of Mr Koizumi's administration comes at a time when his government is facing a range of difficulties that span the serious business of legislation but also encompass the staple diet of Japanese politics bribery and sex Koichi Kato Mr Koizumi's long-time political ally has been forced out of parliament amid bribery allegations while his other most significant ally Taku Yamasaki is fighting a sex scandal Bribery and corruption in the foreign ministry another recurring theme during Mr Mori's year in power has also re-emerged after Muneo Suzuki one of the ministry's most influential bureaucrats was forced to resign for receiving kickbacks He now awaits criminal charges This sour cocktail of problems is not without cost The latest newspaper polls reveal that 71 per cent of those asked believe Mr Koizumi will not be able to achieve his reforms and that more people 46 per cent disapprove of Mr Koizumi than approve of him 43 per cent Shigefumi Matsuzawa a rising member of the Democratic party of Japan and a member of the lower house of parliament said The public is losing faith with Koizumi  Mr Koizumi's 43 per cent approval rating takes him to within a whisker of Mr Mori's highest ever approval rating of 41 9 per cent raising for the first time the unusual prospect of Mr Koizumi being more unpopular than Mr Mori The latest polls also reveal that support for the LDP is now at just 19 6 per cent a number that also throws up a disturbing comparison with the Mori administration It is the first time the LDP's support has fallen below 20 per cent since Mr Mori was prime minister The result of all the scandal bribery and gaffes of recent weeks has not only hit Mr Koizumi's popularity ratings but has also focused attention away from the legislative agenda Mr Matsuzawa said the prime minister was seeking to demonstrate his ability to achieve reform by having big bills health insurance media control postal service privatisation and defence passed before parliament is dissolved on June 19 Mr Koizumi will be attending the Group of Eight summit in late June and wants to be able to take tangible evidence of reform with him to parade before the world's leaders He is understood to have said in private that if none of the bills passes he would call an election Shigenori Okazaki political analyst at UBS Warburg provided an insight into how the passage of these bills reveal the way in which Mr Koizumi's administration has moved from promising it will exercise authority to embracing classic LDP behind-the-scenes deal-making The anti-reformers offered to save Koizumi's face in exchange for a cabinet reshuffle If the anti-reformers had obstructed the privatisation bills to the end Mr Koizumi would have been in big trouble left with no choice but to dissolve the lower house to call an election at the wrong time In order to avoid such a disastrous scenario anti-reformers chose to pass the privatisation bills after watering them down  The prospects for the acceleration of reform under Mr Koizumi's new cabinet are not good as it is expected to more accurately reflect the balance of power inside the LDP In practice this means that members of the numerically dominant Hashimoto and Horiuchi factions which are broadly conservative and less aggressive reformers than the prime minister and his supporters will have more seats on the cabinet This in turn means that Mr Koizumi will be forced to compromise a development that will either retard the legislative process or trigger a distinct watering down of any reforms ,3
2002-06-05, America Movil the Latin American telecommunications group is facing a possible downgrade of its debt by Moody's credit rating agency after buying out its Canadian partner in a Brazilian cellular venture The company said this week it would pay $366m to buy Bell Canada International's 39 per cent stake in Telecom Americas which operates four Brazilian cellular carriers and assume $1 9bn in debt America Movil is also expected to exercise its option to buy Southwestern Bell International's 11 1 per cent stake in a non-cash transaction which would increase its control of the company to 93 per cent from 42 per cent Concerned that cash expenditure and a high level of short-term debt from Telecom Americas would reduce the parent company's financial flexibility Moody's said it might revise America Movil's global peso-denominated debt from A3 and its foreign currency debt from Baa1 In contrast with Moody's Standard and Poor's affirmed its rating of America Movil's debt rating of BBB+ for peso debt and BBB for its foreign-currency denominated debt after the announcement but changed its outlook from positive to stable due to its greater exposure to the Brazilian market The rating agency said it believed America Movil's need for investment would diminish since its Mexican users were migrating from analogue to digital services and it had already upgraded its systems in major cities to provide GSM service Carlos Garcia Moreno finance director for America Movil expressed confidence that the company was able to meet its debt with interest coverage ratios of 8 to 10 We are confident that the transaction we are undertaking will not leave us in a bad situation with regard to credit he said He said the company's debt-to-ebitda ratio was at a peak of 1 8 to 1 9 after the transaction but would decline to about 1 2 by the end of 2003 ,1
2002-06-15, European stock markets suffered traumatic falls yesterdayextending losses that have beensteadily gathering pace for the last month While technology-relatedsectors had led the way in previousdays yesterday the whole market was weaker with declinesin every sector At many points during the day there were no rising shares at all among the blue chips in Frankfurt Paris or London Richard Urwin head of research at Gartmore Investment Management said My personal view is that this selling is now panic selling I wouldn't have argued this a week ago  The pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300 index slumped 4 1 per cent at one stage But in early evening trade with most leading markets already closed the index had trimmed the loss to 2 6 per cent at 1064 22 The benchmark index which has lost ground over each of the last five weeks is back at levels last seen in late September in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the US The drama was pronounced in Germany where Deutsche Telekom shares breached the psychologically important {XEU}10 mark and the Neuer Markt growth stock segment fell to an all-time low By late Frankfurt trading the DAX-30 blue-chip index was down 3 7 per cent to 4304 56 its lowest level this year although it managed to recoup some of the early afternoon losses prompted by downbeat US consumer data We are in a bear market the only thing that matters is bad news Neutral news is bad news good news is ignored said Marius Horner technical analyst at German broker Lang & Schwarz But there is not enough volume to say this is a sell-off he added He warned there was little prospect of an upturn next week Deutsche Telekom's anticipated drop below {XEU}10 found its trigger in a profit warning from US mobile carrier Sprint PCS on Thursday which raised doubts about Voice-Stream the German operator's US subsidiary DT's debt and the expectation that it will not cut it this year is already in the share price said Frank Heise fund manager at Union Investment The concern about its position in the US is hitting now  While the DAX-30 remained well above its post-September 11 level the already battered Neuer Markt saw its Nemax All Share index fall to an all-time low down 4 4 per cent to 699 94 although the index had clawed back some of its losses by the early evening In France the benchmark CAC index fell to its lowest level since September 21 the day last year that the world's stock markets touched their lowest point However the CAC 40 at 3843 07 is still 200 points above that September trough A notable casualty was France Telecom which fell almost 7 per cent to its lowest level since its shares were floated in 1997 Both France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have been singled out for punishment by investors because of their heavy debt levels Michael O'Sullivan equity strategist at Commerzbank in London said there was a technical dimension to the sell-off Insurance companies were being forced to sell because under their covenants the actuaries required them to sell equities when they go down It was difficult to make predictions that the market would bounce back from here because the valuations of equities to bonds were not showing massive undervaluation I don't subscribe to a meltdown scenario The next couple of months will test the patience of investors because earnings will recover at different paces in different sectors ,2
2002-06-10, Hermes Pensions Management one of the UK's strongest campaigners on corporate governance has linked with Nissay Asset Management in a move that could spread Western-style activism to Japan NAMCO owned by Nippon Life Japan's largest insurer is sending Toshiaki Oguchi a senior executive to the UK for a year to work with Hermes' corporate governance experts Michelle Edkins head of Hermes' corporate governance team said the exchange of views could help Hermes to get its message across in Japan We don't think that Japanese companies are governed that well she said But if they believe that they have got what it takes they should explain it to us  Ms Edkins said Hermes was not planning to impose a US or UK corporate governance model on the Japanese companies in which it invests But she stressed the importance of basic standards on issues such as directors' pay and the role of non-executive directors Hermes owned by the giant BT pension scheme has £45bn of assets under management mostly in index-tracking funds It operates a £634m UK Focus Fund recently launched a European Focus fund and does not rule out the possibility of launching a Japanese Focus fund ,2

2002-06-11, If there were ever any doubts that French voters supported Jean-Marie Le Pen's presidential bid more as a protest than as a sign of any faith in his policies they have been dispelled by this week's legislative election results By winning only 11 per cent of the vote in Sunday's first round Mr Le Pen's extreme rightwing National Front FN not only fell nearly 7 percentage points short of his personal score in this year's presidential poll but was also below the 15 per cent it won at the legislative election in 1997 Other parties at the two extremes of the political spectrum also suffered setbacks By abandoning fringe candidates French voters have repented of the eccentric behaviour that eliminated Lionel Jospin the Socialist candidate from the first round of the presidential race and briefly elevated Mr Le Pen to a prominent position as a challenger in the second On the far left Trotskyite parties won less than 3 per cent of the vote on Sunday less than a third of their total in the first round of the presidential election in May and they will not be represented by any deputies in the National Assembly The French Communist party of Robert Hue which compromised on its hard-left traditions by participating in a Socialist-led coalition for the past five years also saw its support drop below 5 per cent half the level of 1997 But it is the far-right campaigning on a law and order and anti-immigration platform that has endured the greatest disappointment after the euphoria of the presidential vote Bruno Megret who broke away from Mr Le Pen's FN to form the equally extreme Mouvement National Republicain did not gain even enough votes to qualify for next week's second round of voting in his constituency in the Bouches-du-Rhone in southern France The FN itself which had been hoping to capitalise on its new-found notoriety to reach the second round in up to 300 of the 577 constituencies now finds itself confined to fewer than 40 Polling organisations predict that it will win a maximum of two seats in the assembly Probably the party's main weakness is its reliance on the popularity of Mr Le Pen an advantage in a presidential race but not in a legislative campaign where voters begin to scrutinise policies as much as personalities Mr Le Pen furthermore did not stand for election on the grounds that he is already a member of the European parliament his enemies say it was because he knew he might lose and few of the FN candidates are prominent local figures We would have liked our candidates to build on the magnificent presidential result explained Bruno Gollnisch the FN's number two but they are not as well known as Jean-Marie Le Pen  One of the few to make it to the second round was Mr Le Pen's daughter Marine in the industrial north but even she is unlikely to beat the Socialist incumbent Another problem for the FN was that President Jacques Chirac's rightwing Union pour la Majorite Presidentielle managed to steal the extreme right's thunder on the law and order issue by talking tough on crime and creating 28 crime-busting squads around the country After the FN's poor showing Mr Le Pen was reduced to complaining about the connivance of traditional parties in maintaining an anti-democratic majority voting system for the National Assembly FN leaders down but not out after Sunday's results say they are looking to make the most of European and French regional elections in 2004 Both votes use forms of proportional representation that favour smaller parties such as the FN ,3
2002-06-07, Tomorrow's Epsom Derby is horse-racing's ultimate prize The thoroughbred colt that wins will instantly make his reputation and add millions to his bloodstock market value In past years the British Bloodstock Agency was at the heart of this process The 91-year-old BBA was the most respected name in the multimillion-dollar business of horse-trading often poised with an offer to buy the Derby winner for an ambitious client But today's BBA a publicly quoted company since 1984 has been reduced to a shell called Newmarket Investments after a failed attempt to return it to private hands and three chairmen in 12 months Its pre-tax profits for the year to March 2001 were down 37 per cent Now Anthony Stroud an equally familiar name in the Epsom paddock has set out to revive the BBA brand For most of the past decade Mr Stroud was racing manager to the sport's most powerful patron Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai buying prospective Derby candidates at auction and monitoring their progress before the big day On April 1 he bought the BBA name and added it to Anthony Stroud Bloodstock the trading company he has run since leaving the Maktoums in 1999 Mr Stroud's task is a challenging one not least because his former employers dominate today's market The best bloodstock in the northern hemisphere is currently in two camps the Maktoum family  and Irish entrepreneur John Magnier owner of Galileo last year's Epsom Derby winner and the renowned Coolmore Stud in Ireland Both have in-house teams which buy in competition with Mr Stroud They also sell infrequently retaining their best horses for breeding Mr Stroud also fears that some of the BBA's longstanding clients have already cut their ties with the company During the period of upheaval at the BBA several important agents left to set up on their own taking BBA clients with them In September the BBA was down to two agents for the Tattersalls Houghton Sales at Newmarket when 130 horses sold for a total of £30m $44m Mr Stroud's strategy to win back old BBA clients and attract new business is to provide a more individually tailored service than the BBA of old In the past clients were offered a package covering every aspect of the bloodstock business from buying and selling horses to shipping and insurance But this is less suited to today's concentrated market in which smaller clients want individual encouragement and support to take on the Maktoum family and Mr Magnier at the races It's now a mistake to become too big Mr Stroud says Mr Stroud plans a targeted domestic advertising campaign and personal meetings with important clients to counter any negative impressions formed during last year's struggle for control of the BBA He says he plans to play on the company's history and its long-standing reputation for integrity professionalism and expertise A brand can certainly become damaged and within Britain the BBA name definitely suffered as a consequence of what happened to the company as a whole Mr Stroud says But the company has successfully traded for nearly a century  In his favour is the fact that many racehorse owners will have been absent from the racing scene during the upheaval of the last 12 months Each year about a quarter of registered owners in Britain take a break from the sport But the overall number 8677 in 1996 and 8862 in 2000 is relatively constant as others return Internationally Mr Stroud argues the BBA name has not suffered as much The BBA which has an established network of inter-national representatives continues to have a good name abroad from work over the years in the likes of Japan the Far East India Australia and New Zealand he says To consolidate the BBA's international reputation Mr Stroud will spend at least five months of the next year away from his offices near Newmarket the heart of Britain's bloodstock industry He believes that in time horses will be traded over the internet But for now he maintains that the business is based on eye-to-eye one-to-one client relationships Captain Tim Bulwer-Long a rival of Mr Stroud with clients such as the multi-millionaire Wafic Said supports his argument that today's more concentrated market favours smaller operations offering a personal service Robert Nataf who set up Horse France in 1973 to mirror the BBA octopus says his company has also had to evolve to reflect the current market Mr Nataf now buys about 150 horses a year down from a peak of more than 400 20 years ago and has also cut the number of offices he has around the world We were too big for today's business Individual agents have the power The era of the hypermarket in bloodstock is over Mr Nataf says now Clients today want us to be their corner store open 24 hours Personal attention not all-in service is what they want  Mr Stroud's own clients from the boom years of the early 1980s may not be of great relevance now he admits It's the three 'Ds' Mr Stroud says Most of my clients from then are either in debt divorced or dead Some are all three  But since leaving the Maktoums Mr Nataf says Mr Stroud has shown that he can be a successful agent in his own right With Anthony Stroud Bloodstock he had a good car with the BBA name he has a bigger engine  For Mr Stroud that may also mean more horsepower ,2
2002-06-20, KPNQwest bondholders warned yesterday that they would call for a wide- ranging inquiry by financial regulators into the circumstances leading to the bankruptcy of the Dutch data network operator The bondholders want officials in the US and Netherlands to investigate whether the crippled carrier's parents KPN of the Netherlands and Qwest Communications of the US or its management knew of its financial plight before its predicament was made public The bondholders are unlikely to recover any of their investment Gary Klesch chairman of Klesch & Co a London finance boutique and a specialist in distressed debt said he was among a number of bondholders together holding about {XEU}1 6bn $1 5bn in KPNQwest notes concerned at the company's rapid demise Mr Klesch said that while KPNQwest management indicated on April 24 that it was facing severely deteriorating market conditions and trimmed full-year revenue and earnings projections it still forecast earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation of {XEU}140m on sales of about {XEU}1bn The company also said at that time that Bear Stearns the investment bank was advising it on alternative means of reorganising its balance sheet but within 29 days it was bankrupt That cannot happen in the real world said Mr Klesch As fast as Enron melted down this beats it Something like this does not happen that fast Someone must have seen that train coming down the tracks for some time  The bondholders will also seek clarification of the relationship between KPNQwest and its parents Analysts have raised concerns about the company's dependence on a revenue stream from its major shareholders that in 2001 comprised 43 per cent of total sales of {XEU}810 1m A person close to KPNQwest dismissed the bondholder calls as an attempt merely to throw a spanner in the works ,2
2002-06-12, There was a nail-biting finish ahead of the deadline for companies leaving or joining the FTSE 100 Schroders the tightly traded fund management group had started the session at 107th in the overall market ranking yesterday and its place in the Footsie appeared to be secure companies have to be below 110th in the ranking before they automatically drop out Then in early trading the share price spiralled down almost 10 per cent and there was a flurry of speculation that it would fall out By the close however the tightly-traded stock had recovered to close only 1{1/2} lower at 660p after a timely buy-back of 72500 shares at 591 9p each by Cazenove On the other hand there was no reprieve for Arm Holdings which perversely was the star performer in the Footsie with a recovery of 10{1/2} to 180p as it appeared that the nightmare was finally over Historically share prices of companies that leave the Footsie tend to recover as the hedge funds and speculative traders which have been pushing them lower lose interest The one-time technology star had plunged from the £10 level two years ago to bob closer to the 200p mark and had been facing relegation from the main index for some time At 119th at the start of trading yesterday it was essentially a foregone conclusion that the company would be replaced when the FTSE review committee meets today Elsewhere Electrocomponents and Logica looked sure candidates for relegation while precious metals group Johnson Matthey one of the original constituents of the 100 index back in 1984 plastics group Bunzl and Xstrata the recently-listed mining company appeared sure entrants Electrocomponents drifted 3 to 414{1/2}p and Logica rose 3 to 218{1/2}p Johnson Matthey fell 25 to £11 45 and Bunzl 8 to 524p but Xstrata gained 21{1/2} to 966{1/2}p Jarvis fails to impress Jarvis the contractor which maintains the railway line along the Potters Bar crash site fell back despite announcing that it had made an 85 per cent increase in full-year profits and was sitting on a record £10bn order book The company also said it had agreed an £80m contract to provide refurbish and manage six primary schools for the London Borough of Richmond The shares were up 13 shortly after the figures but after some critical comment highlighting the apparent disparity between the record figures and the poor track record they fell back to close a net 8 lower at 315{1/2}p First Choice Holidays rose 6{1/2} to 115p as the tour operator's first half losses were lower than expected Also unlike its larger rival MyTravel the company said it was optimistic about its ability to hit full-year profit forecasts Finally the shares continued to benefit from a recent European court ruling which may allow MyTravel to renew its bid interest in First Choice Merrill restated its buy advice adding that at just 10 times forecast 2003 earnings per share the company remained the broker's preferred play in the sub-sector Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said First Choice was the best play in the sector but rated the stock underperform high risk and was cautious on valuation grounds Abbey National fell another 6 to 922p as brokers continued to kick the mortgage bank following its profits warning on Monday JP Morgan cut its 2002 and 2003 earnings estimates by 18 per cent and 12 per cent and lowered its current year dividend forecast by 5 per cent As a result it reduced its fair value target from £10 80 to £10 15 but said upside of at least 15 per cent would be required to buy the shares given what we see as the risks attached It said that the upside requirement implied that the shares were not worth buying until they traded around 880p Medisys slipped to 40{1/2}p after the healthcare and pharmaceutical group's interim earnings fell well below market expectations The safety syringe developer reported losses widening in the first half to March to £5 1m from £3 1m a year ago Analysts had forecast that the company would break even GlaxoSmithKline was undermined by a report in the US which said that the pharmaceuticals group was in a dispute with the US authorities about tax payments on billions of dollars of sales Analysts said the problem had been around for a while but the shares still fell 49 to £13 61 despite the company buying back 3 6m shares at £13 83 each The slide wiped out almost all of the previous day's brief recovery Hays higher Hays the business services group was squeezed 4 higher to 165{1/2}p as dealers covered short positions Severn Trent dropped first thing after the group reported a profit below market forecasts and warned it faced a difficult financial year The company reported a profit before exceptionals for the year to end-March of £233 3m up from £221 7m the previous year but below the market's consensus forecast of £243m Chief executive Robert Walker said the group faced a challenging 2002/3 due to continued cost pressures and broadly unchanged prices Merrill Lynch said In the new financial year new efficiencies will probably be harder to secure and a setback looks quite probable in our view as the utility will probably have flat revenues  The shares were down 16 at worst but recovered later to close 3 better at 787p Early gains for Reuters Group were eroded by a sell note from Teather & Greenwood The broker cut its target and forecasts to reflect the continued weakness in investment markets and the action being taken by Reuters clients to reduce costs It cut its profit target to £465m from £510m and set a 397p share target The oil majors resisted a US downgrade and BP added 4{1/2} at 560p while Shell Transport rose 3{1/2} to 512p BP Shell Petroleum and Royal Dutch Petroleum were downgraded by Prudential Securities to sell from

2002-04-04, Shares in Singapore Telecommunications fell to a record low of S$1 56 yesterday on reports it had increased its stake in Indonesia's largest cellular phone operator in a US$429m deal Investors have been sceptical about state-owned SingTel's regional expansion strategy which has resulted in losses for minority shareholders as promised earnings failed to match acquisition costs SingTel has bought stakes in five mobile phone companies from India to Australia one of the fastest-expanding regions in the world for mobile phone use Last year SingTel added Indonesia to its network by buying a 22 3 per cent stake in PT Telkomsel a unit of Indonesian phone group PT Telkom from the indebted Dutch phone operator KPN Telekom for US$600m The reported deal yesterday with Telkom would raise SingTel's stake in Telkomsel to 34 3 per cent SingTel and Telkom declined to comment on reports of the deal The shares bought from Telkom were priced higher than those that SingTel bought from KPN last year But some analysts defended the deal Essentially it allows SingTel to accrete more of the earnings from Telkomsel which is a very profitable company Gregory Yap a Singapore-based analyst at OCBC Research told Reuters They may pay a little bit more for the stake from Telkom but it wouldn't make much difference to the balance sheet he said SingTel is expected to increase gradually its stake in Telkomsel to 49 per cent with Telkom holding 51 per cent Stern Stewart a US consulting firm concluded recently that SingTel was one of the world's biggest destroyers of shareholder value by wiping out US$30bn in wealth between 1997 and 2001 with total shareholder return being minus 10 per cent during the same period ,2

2002-04-03, When the electric arc furnace starts up in the Arconi steel plant in north-eastern Slovenia the sound is like a Wagnerian chorus singing so loud you cannot hear yourself think But noise is no guide to size and Acroni is small in steel terms says Vasilij Presern general manager of the plant part of state-owned steel complex Slovenske Zelezarne We are a small flexible niche player  To prove his point he announces that the company's tiny quantity of exports to the US has been exempted from the government's recent protectionist moves Steel-making has a long history in Slovenia which was the source for much of the steel in socialist Yugoslavia exporting 75 per cent of its output to its sister republics At Jesenice Acroni's base in a valley in the Julian Alps steel was first made from iron ore in local mountains But Slovenia's independence has forced radical changes in the country's steel industry Acroni has suffered through much of this We got our freedom but we had been exporting at least 80 per cent to the Yugoslav market We had 15000 workers here then now we have 4000 says Mr Presern For Acroni however like the rest of Slovenia's steel industry more changes are still to come The whole of Slovenske Zelezarne has been divided and will be sold by the government In a country proud of its steemaking heritage this has provoked another anti-privatisation outcry Jeklo Store is now named Inexa Store after its Swedish part-owners which owns 70 per cent Christer Olsson chairman says Inexa had to move carefully to buy Store Five years ago it was not a popular idea to privatise a steel mill It was even worse if a foreigner came into the picture That is why we joined with a local operation but the Swedes are running this plant the others are sleeping Some people still think the state should be running it Mr Olsson says At Acroni the privatisation process is rolling on Some talks have taken place and Mr Presern expects a tender to be published by summer But people at the plant are anxious a sale should not be made at any price At a round table meeting with Mr Presern his deputy at Acroni the chief engineer and the head of the union all are agreed that a deal should guarantee certain rights for workers They point out that it was only with the management and union working as a team 100 per cent respect for union demands that the plant survived a tough 15 years and a cut of 10000 in its workforce We have had a lot of interest from different companies and yes some were foreign says Mr Presern It is natural to want to eliminate state interest through privatisation but we will not be happy if the company is sold to a big global group such as you find in Germany or Italy and Acroni becomes only a production plant  Mr Presern sits on the board of the SZ and advises government on the best bid As well as seeking to protect worker rights he says with a wry smile he would like to keep his own job as head of the company Neatly summing up a Slovenian attitude towards privatision he adds And if we don't get good options we don't need to sell  Lucy Smy,1
2002-06-11, When local Japanese media reported two months ago that Sony was negotiating to sell a controlling stake in its life insurance unit to a foreign insurer employees at Sony Life were aghast Disbelief quickly turned into fierce opposition to the parent company's sudden plans Within a week almost all Sony Life's sales agents had signed a petition resisting the reported deal Sony sought to calm tension by issuing a statement that the basis of negotiations with the foreign insurer was to seek a 50-50 joint venture and maintain the Sony brand but hostility towards such a deal still runs high The discord threatens to derail negotiations between Sony and the foreign buyer reported by various sources as GE Capital GE group's financial services arm In essence the sales force is concerned that the potential foreign buyer would introduce a rigorous performance-based pay system according to one sales agent I know some colleagues who have started to look for new jobs while others are working harder to improve their sales record so they will keep their job he says More importantly many of the sales agents enjoy the prestige associated with the Sony brand If ownership changes these highly trained agents known as Life Planners may choose not to stay Reports of the sale have also made Sony Life's policy holders nervous despite the insurer having one of the sector's highest credit ratings and solvency margin ratios a key gauge of its financial health These worries stem from the fact that Japanese life insurers that have linked up with foreign insurers in the past have all been either on the brink of collapse or have once filed for court rehabilitation Results for the fiscal year have shown that most of the foreign-affiliated life insurance companies that took on collapsed domestic insurers continued to face high policy cancellations Certainly outstanding policies in force for GE Edison wholly owned by GE Capital declined 9 per cent for the year ended in March on a tide of cancellations by former policy holders of the failed Toho Life which GE absorbed To offset this slow growth GE has been expanding its market share aggressively through mergers and acquisitions Earlier in the year GE bought Saison Life a small insurer Management at GE Edison reiterated this month that it continued to look for opportunities to expand business through acquisitions Mid-sized Sony Life with total policies in force of Y24000bn $193bn and assets of Y1700bn appears a likely candidate Sony Life is among the few insurers enjoying double-digit growth as the sector suffers rising cancellations a decline in new customers and poor investment returns But analysts speculate it may hit a wall soon Growth has been slowing and its liabilities in the form of future insurance policy benefits have been increasing faster than its equity Though Sony injected Y50bn in capital into its insurance unit last March the parent company may be forced to recapitalise the insurance unit in the future The electronics maker may be unwilling to spare that extra capital analysts say amid rising investment expenditure in its core electronics business particularly its games division All this is starting to make the estimated initial Y500bn-Y800bn price tag for Sony Life look high ,1
2002-06-13, The dollar yesterday fell to a 17-month low against the euro amid continued worries over the outlook for US companies The euro's rise above $0 95 was fleeting but rekindled hopes that the currency is now heading back towards parity against the dollar Euro bulls were disappointed however that the currency stopped short of $0 951 a more technically significant level The $0 951 level was being protected by investors keen to defend the value of options postions said Chris Furness senior currency strategist at the economic consultancy 4Cast But these positions are going to expire at the end of this week leaving the dollar unprotected he added By the middle of New York trading the euro stood at $0 945 up slightly on Tuesday's London close of $0 943  History seldom repeats itself in foreign exchange But there may be lessons to be drawn from previous downward cycles in the dollar according to Michael Lewis senior economist at Deutsche Bank in London Since 1987 the average medium term down trend in the dollar has lasted between 14 and 18 months and has taken the US currency the equivalent of 20 cents lower against the euro If history is repeated this would take the euro to $1 05 by November Most consider this to be unlikely Parity with the dollar by the end of the year is considered a more realistic objective The key question however is whether the dollar is now in a medium term downtrend or whether it is merely another pause for breath in a longer term rally This is still not the dollar's largest fall since the inception of the euro Since July of 2001 the euro has risen from around $0 836 to just short of $0 95 This was trumped by the euro's rally between October 2000 and January 2001 when the euro climbed from $0 823 to $0 95 9 Ultimately this proved to be a false alarm for the dollar Mr Lewis said this move in the dollar looks more like the real thing despite strong upward revisions to US growth expectations in recent months Growth expectations for 2002 are now higher than they were prior to September 11th but the dollar and US equities are still falling Even though growth expectations have risen financial markets have been paring back their forecasts for Fed tightening The reason for this paradoxical situation said Mr Lewis is that the growth is seen to be of low quality The growth has been dependent on inventory adjustments and government spending rather than capital investment and rising domestic demand he said There is a sense that the recovery will be short on profits  In 2000 the rise in the dollar was an important ingredient in the US economic miracle helping to keep inflation subdued during a period of speedy economic growth Now the weakening of the dollar is likely to be relatively welcome for the US authorities providing relief to manufacturing without triggering inflationary concerns Meanwhile eurozone officials seem relieved that the long term downtrend in the euro appears to be over  With US equities and corporate bond markets looking shaky the US has been finding it harder to fund its current account deficit But at least part of the shortfall is being covered by dollar purchases by central banks not just in Japan although the Japanese have been the most conspicuous and large scale dollar buyers Other Asian central banks Asia have been buying dollars to prevent a rise in their currencies choking off demand for their exports Further evidence of this buying can be seen in Federal Reserve data on custodial holdings of US Treasury bonds by overseas central banks said Tony Norfield head of currency research at ABN Amro In the week to the June 5 central banks bought $17 3bn of US Treasury bonds Total purchases for May and the first week of June was $35 4bn a large portion of the quarterly current account deficit which is likely to be about $105bn ,2

2002-06-08, The former government adviser accused of gathering information to smear members of a train crash survivors group yesterday apologised unreservedly for his actions as critics called for tougher regulation of officials in his position Dan Corry who used to work for Stephen Byers sent e-mails to Labour party headquarters asking staff to find out whether any of the people taking charge of the Paddington Survivors Group were Conservative supporters Mr Corry said I profoundly regret what I did on this occasion  Simon Benham current chairman of the group which was formed after the fatal Paddington rail crash of October 1999 said he was sickened by the investigation I have no political affiliations whatsoever That goes for the rest of the group he said Pam Warren who chaired the group at the time of Mr Corry's inquiry called for a full apology from Tony Blair However a spokesman for Mr Blair said the prime minister had already expressed regret and had nothing further to add Alistair Darling Mr Byers' recent successor as transport secretary moved swiftly to distance himself from the affair His officials published the e-mail exchange in full and said that by coming clean they hoped to demonstrate that things had changed since the days of Mr Byers and his controversial spin-doctor Jo Moore We have done two e-mail stories before and both of them were very badly handled said a Department of Transport official This is a different approach Alistair believes we should be completely open about this and get it all out there It may be painful but it is better in the long run  Since both Mr Corry and Mr Byers have already left the department the government appeared hopeful that the media storm would soon blow over However the Conservatives said the scandal proved the need for much stronger regulation of special advisers such as Mr Corry who are appointed by politicians as temporary civil servants and operate under a different code of conduct to regular civil servants As a matter of urgent necessity the government must introduce a new Civil Service Act said David Davis Conservative party chairman A Tory official said the party was not alleging that Mr Corry had broken the code of conduct But he questioned whether someone on the government payroll should have been involved in this kind of activity Mr Blair's spokesman said the government was committed to civil service legis-lation in due course ,3
2002-06-24, Consob Italy's stock market regulator has suspended its chief inspector over his role in the troubles of Bipop-Carire a medium-sized bank whose market value briefly topped {XEU}25bn $23 5bn before collapsing last year The suspension of Fabrizio Tedeschi comes at the start of an internal investigation by Consob into contacts with Bipop directors that may not have been sanctioned by Consob's five-person commission But his removal seems to be motivated by intramural fighting for control of Rome-based Consob's office in Milan the financial hub of Italy and the operation overseen by Mr Tedeschi people familiar with Consob said Mr Tedeschi has clashed with newly appointed commissioners who have sought to weaken his resolve to investigate Bipop and numerous other politically sensitive cases His suspension over his role in Bipop however is the most striking result yet of a series of investigations that could also embroil the Bank of Italy which supervises Bipop and which failed to uncover irregularities that exposed Bipop to large losses Bipop's troubles led to a takeover this spring by Banca di Roma which received backing from Antonio Fazio the governor of the central bank and a friend of the Banca di Roma chairman Mr Fazio who must approve all large bank transactions normally does not comment on potential deals but publicly supported Banca di Roma's offer before it was accepted by shareholders Elio Lannutti chairman of Adusbef Italy's largest consumer association on Saturday denounced the sepulchral silence surrounding the central bank's investigation of Bipop and said it should suspend its own officials Consob officials declined to comment on the suspension It is the first in more than 10 years against a senior official at Consob which has struggled to improve its reputation after numerous scandals during the 1980s Officials at Consob and the Bank of Italy have been pointing the finger at each other for failing to uncover Bipop's troubles Their relations became particularly tense last summer when each began to sequester documents at Bipop's headquarters in Brescia near Milan and in other branches Investigative magistrates also have seized numerous documents Mr Tedeschi has testified with magistrates over Bipop Bipop's market value soared in 1999 and early 2000 thanks to a series of investments in internet banking including costly purchases in Italy Germany and Spain After the internet bubble burst and its shares began to slide large shareholders who had borrowed heavily to help finance Bipop's acquisitions ran into financial difficulty Their problems in turn led to the discovery one year ago that Bipop was exposed to large losses as a result of guaranteeing investments by some 250 large clients ,1
2002-06-27, As the world's investors took cover yesterday from the latest accounting bombshell to hit Wall Street Federal Reserve policymakers put on a familiar display of phlegmatic order amid the turmoil The US central bank as expected prosaically left its main monetary policy instrument its target for the federal funds rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting of its policymaking open market committee FOMC But with US equity markets plunging through the low point they reached in the weeks after September 11 it must have been a troubling thought for policymakers that the combination of Kenneth Lay and Bernie Ebbers had done more damage to Americans' wealth than Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta Last autumn the Fed cut interest rates aggressively to shield the economy from terrorist-related blows to confidence So far and with not much further room for cuts it has sat tight as markets have steadily crumbled in the past four months Fed officials are concerned about equity weakness and indeed about the steep slide in the dollar that has accompanied it But going into this week's FOMC meeting policymakers remained cautiously optimistic that recovery would not be derailed The biggest source of comfort is that despite the big declines in equity values so far this year the real economy continues to show encouraging signs of life Overall output growth in the second quarter of the year which ends this weekend will be a little more disappointing than looked likely two months ago but should still be in the range of 2 5 per cent at an annual rate That is well below the inventory-adjustment-driven 5 6 per cent pace of the first quarter but still consistent with steady recovery Especially encouraging has been the manufacturing sector which is several months into a recovery from a two-year slide Yesterday the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders rose by 0 6 per cent in May the fifth increase in the past six months Signs of strength in the capital goods markets are what the Fed has been hoping to see since they should signal the start of a gradual revival in business investment the collapse of which was the main factor that drove the economy into recession last year And for all the concern in markets about the dollar's decline Fed economists like to point out that the stimulative effect on exports will at least counterbalance the deflationary impact on US financial assets Consumers hold the key Fed policymakers have looked with awe on American consumers' resilience in the past few years But they also know that part of Americans' capacity to keep spending has been provided by the Fed itself In late 1998 when markets swooned after the Russian debt default and Asian financial crisis and again after the September 11 attacks last year Alan Greenspan and colleagues moved aggressively to cut short-term interest rates This time with the Fed running out of ammunition falling stock prices could be more problematic for consumer spending Consumers remain stretched with heavy debt burdens and historically low savings rates And this week the Conference Board an independent research group reported that June had seen the steepest fall in consumer confidence since last autumn as Americans seemed to take fright at the events on Wall Street Yet consumers may receive a shot of adrenaline from the same forces that have been sending stocks lower As equities have declined in the past few months bond prices have shot higher sending interest rates lower As a result the housing market where big gains have for most Americans more than offset the impact of falling stock prices remains as strong as ever Yesterday the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in May rose by 8 1 per cent from a month earlier Consumers seem to be in the early stages of another round of mortgage refinancing which should put hundreds of billions of dollars back into their pockets This may represent a belated adjustment in longer-term interest rates to the Fed's aggressive easing of last year Or it may simply show that the market is once again ahead of the central bank in rebalancing financial conditions in the economy The critical factor is that as long as inflation stays low the stimulus from lower interest rates need not be reversed any time soon That is again the source of cautious Fed optimism In spite of increases in energy prices this year consumer prices remain flat indeed some measures of inflation are showing the lowest rate of price increases in more than 40 years Though the dollar's decline will push up import prices and some domestic prices the US is still a relatively closed economy and is not likely to see a generalised and sustained increase in prices as a result of events on currency markets Against that backdrop the Fed is under little pressure to raise interest rates This same low inflation is Fed officials believe part of the reason for the weakness in equity markets Policymakers do not appear to share some of the more alarmist views of inter-national investors that the accounting issues at World-Com and elsewhere mean US corporate reports are fundamentally untrustworthy although clearly there are many significant problems And it is hard to attribute the entire decline in US equity prices in the past six months or even the bulk of it to the corporate governance issue A large part of it may be the result of the weakness of nominal demand in the economy Inflation is low or even negative so the relatively small increases in real demand of the past six months are reflected in very small gains in nominal demand and in corporate sales and profits Put another way companies face a situation unprecedented in the recent past in which they have virtually no pricing power even as real demand starts to recover Of course further steep falls in equity prices would complicate the Fed's task especially if accompanied by a dive in the dollar But for the moment a benign inflationary environment and declines in market interest rates are keeping alive hopes at the central bank that a navigable path can be found through the unravelling of 1990s excess ,2

2002-06-21, Harvey Pitt knows what side his bread is buttered on As chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission he is the nation's chief financial regulator But as an appointee of the president he has to remain keenly aware of political currents For much of the last month there has been growing concern both within the White House and among Republican strategists that the Bush administration was not acting aggressively enough over the accounting scandals that have unfolded since the fall of Enron The gathering wave of corporations under scrutiny it started with Enron but now stretches from Tyco to Xerox from ImClone to Adelphia has renewed public outrage and perhaps more important caused a dangerous loss of confidence in the financial markets which have sunk to new post-September 11 lows in recent days But since George W Bush had in detailing plans for reforms in March left much of the work to the SEC there was little the administration could do directly since the SEC is technically an independent body Instead the administration returned to the bully pulpit In the past two weeks both Lawrence Lindsey the White House's top economic adviser and Paul O'Neill the treasury secretary have issued stinging rebukes of corporate executives Mr Lindsey who is closer to the president than Mr O'Neill singled out financial regulators as partially to blame for the excesses of the late 1990s Yesterday Mr Pitt outlined his blueprint for a new independent regulatory board for the accountancy profession a plan he had promised Mr Bush would be unprecedented and comprehensive A stronger regulator would be in place by the end of the year he said It would have strong disciplinary powers The overwhelming influence of the large accountancy firms on their own regulation would be severely cur-tailed It is far more than anyone expected when Mr Pitt took over from Arthur Levitt Mr Levitt took the SEC to war with the accountancy profession particularly over perceived conflicts of interest that were threa-tening the integrity of their audits of public companies When Mr Pitt took over he promised a gentler approach But his rhetoric yesterday could hardly have been more different We're experiencing a significant loss of investor confidence in public companies their audited financial statements and the accounting profession he said It remains to be seen however whether Mr Pitt has completely found religion when it comes to the accounting profession Critics have argued that the SEC's plan is full of loopholes that will allow the accounting industry to have substantial influence over the board Indeed Robert Herdman the SEC's chief accountant acknowledged that the annual reviews of all large accounting firms mandated by the plan would largely be conducted by accountants from other firms since the board's staff would only include 50 to 75 full-time employees Mr Herdman had called the annual reviews the most important change brought about by the new PAB its predecessor the ineffectual Public Oversight Board had overseen reviews conducted only by peers once every three years and insisted PAB staff would make all important decisions But each review team which in some cases would number in the hundreds would be headed by only a handful of PAB staffers In addition the new proposals contain no mention of perceived conflicts of interest in the profession where firms now regularly peddle lucrative consulting services to their audit clients Such measures form a central part of a Senate bill sponsored by Senator Paul Sarbanes which cleared a key hurdle this week Mr Pitt insists he is just getting started and has said the SEC will voluntarily step aside of Congress acts He has promised new rules on auditor independence and conflicts this summer and the PAB proposal could be modified once the 60-day comment period ends in the autumn Some speculate we are competing with Congress to see who gets to solve our crisis of confidence Mr Pitt said yesterday No such rivalry exists The only important point is that the crisis be solved ,3

2002-04-05, In Germany regional politics has always been a big thing but for many years the federal states or Lander delegated matters concerning funding through international finance to those who knew best In order to meet their budgetary requirements they would issue promissory notes or Schuldscheine to a regional development bank which would in turn issue Pfandbriefe paper based on that collateral This guaranteed a steady flow of capital with preferential treatment on interest payments making it the most common source of funding for any German regional authority But according to Standard & Poor's from last year Schuldschein financing no longer represented the majority of overall German regional debt with its market share dropping to 40 per cent from 60 per cent in 2000 The situation has changed dramatically in the past few years says Christian Esters a regional debt analyst at S&P in Frankfurt The German regions are turning increasingly to funding through direct issues of international euro-denominated benchmark bonds  A case in point is Brandenburg one of five formerly East German Lander Until now it has funded itself exclusively through Schuldscheine and a one-off domestic bond issue last year On Monday it will launch a week-long roadshow in conjunction with bookrunners Deutsche Bank and WestLB to woo institutional investors into buying its debut international bond issue which is expected to be worth {XEU}1bn Since 1999 German state bond issuance has more than quadrupled from about {XEU}7bn to more than {XEU}30bn in 2001 with analysts agreeing that these figures will be sustained in the coming years North-Rhine Westphalia was by far the largest issuer last year borrowing {XEU}12bn through 55 issues The introduction of the euro was the main catalyst for the switch from Schuldschein financing to international bonds says Mr Esters The creation of a single large and liquid money market meant Pfandbriefe retracted their preferential agreements with the states because they could thrive without relying on the Lander for business And on the other side the states were increasingly attracted by the idea of borrowing directly from a more diversified pool of international investors So issuance is growing with German regional debt already accounting for more than four-fifths of the European sub-sovereign debt market a domination due partly to the high level of budgetary autonomy enjoyed by the Lander and partly by the sheer size of their bond issues However one question that hangs over the market is whether investors will continue to be receptive to regional debt as opposed to straight sovereign debt If you are prepared to sacrifice some liquidity regional bonds are less liquid than sovereigns for yield regional debt carries a higher risk weighting and lower creditworthiness then you may be tempted by regional debt as part of a portfolio diversification strategy says Bill Oliver head of global municipal research at Alliance Capital However sub-sovereign debt only accounts for a small part of the credit markets making it difficult for asset managers to treat it as a separate asset class One encouraging trend is the growing sophistication of sub-sovereign debt issuers Many German states are being increasingly staffed by analysts with experience in private-sector finance and less by civil servants Mr Esters says ,3
2002-06-25, Cadbury Schweppes' acquisition of 51 per cent of Kent a Turkish confectioner is a sweet exception to more bitter experiences of foreign direct investment in Turkey The UK company bought its $90m stake two months ago from the Tahincioglu family which founded Kent in 1956 The family accelerated its search for a strategic investor after a devaluation in February 2001 pushed Kent into the red Despite sales of $110m last year and underlying earnings of $25m Kent declared a net loss of $14m This was attributed to a sharp increase in the cost of servicing foreign currency debts and a fall in domestic sales following the devaluation This and Turkey's 10 per cent contraction in gross national product made the company more aware of its longer-term limitations Ozcan Tahincioglu in charge of finance and communication at the family holding company says We could make a good quality product at a good price but we lacked access to the export routes we need to grow  Last year its modern plant on the outskirts of Istanbul operated at 30 per cent capacity But there was little scope for gaining market share from competitors without dramatic change Ulker Kent's bigger domestic rival with sales of $1bn was already doing all the right things says the US-educated Mr Tahincioglu Kent's two other main competitors are Nestle the multinational and a joint venture between Kraft and Sabanci one of Turkey's largest conglomerates Before linking up with the world's fourth largest confectionery company Kent's owners also considered a merger with other Turkish family-owned businesses Mahmut Unlu chief executive of Dundas Unlu & Co Securities the Istanbul finance house that advised Cadbury says a lack of trust makes it difficult for Turkish family-owned businesses to merge A match with Cadbury offered several attractions even though it was a wrench for the family to cede control to outsiders Having sold just 15 per cent of the company to the public in 1990 the deal has left the family a 34 per cent stake and joint management rights To overcome the emotional business of selling a stake in a family-owned company you need to feel really comfortable with your foreign partner says Mr Tahincioglu 33 whose father Yakup founded the business Cadbury is strong in chocolate the area where Kent is weak but feels it needs to be strong to complement its 66 per cent share of Turkey's packaged sugar confectionery market and its 14 per cent share of chewing-gum sales Another potential benefit emphasised by Kent managers in selling the deal to a suspicious workforce is the opening up of export markets Kent sells to 66 countries mainly in the Balkans former Soviet republics and the Middle East Until now however the EU has not been a major market despite Turkey being a candidate member John Sunderland chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes says the acquisition provides a strong platform in a key emerging market with direct links to adjacent regions where we successfully operate such as Africa the Middle East and Russia Last but not least Kent's operations are complementary to those of its new majority shareholder Cadbury Schweppes has grown in chewing gum but its only sugar interest is Bassett in the UK argues Mr Tahincioglu Other foreign companies have also found that a local partnership is the safest route to success in Turkey's dynamic but volatile operating environment Looking ahead Mr Tahincioglu says Kent will keep its brand names for sugar confectionery while launching Cadbury products including chocolate Kent's 1000-strong workforce waits to find out what this means for them and whether staffing will change The first visible change is the arrival of a financial director from Cadbury Schweppes Our outlook will change says Ekrem Sualp prod- uction manager We believe we'll find better opportunities on world markets  Leyla Boulton,1
2002-06-11, The Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday moved closer to becoming the first US futures exchange to secure a full stock exchange listing when it applied to the US regulator to make an initial public offering Although the CME has not set a timetable industry observers say the issue planned for the New York Stock Exchange is likely before year-end CME has not yet set the number of shares to be issued but told the Securities and Exchange Commission it could raise up to $150m The CME's moves are the latest development in its efforts to move away from a membership structure to one based on external shareholders They come largely in response to the challenge posed by Europe's biggest derivatives exchanges which have moved nimbly to exploit their shareholder base to make acquisitions as the industry consolidates However CME warned that even after the offering some of its members would still be able to block moves to reform the way the exchange traded in particular any move away from open outcry pit to electronic trading Chicago's futures exchanges unlike their electronically driven European rivals still depend for much of their revenue on fees generated by traders shouting orders in trading pits Our Class B shareholders most of whom are members of our exchange have the ability to preserve their rights to trade on our exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our business including our ability to move from open outcry trade execution to electronic trade execution the CME said The CME does offer electronic trading as well as trades through the pit side by side trading During the first three months of this year about 73 per cent of the CME's trading volume and 56 per cent of its revenue was generated through open outcry trading The exchange's comments nevertheless reflect the difficulty the CME and its local rivals are having moving from open outcry It's been impossible to get the Chicago houses to move from open outcry to pure electronic because there are so many vested interests involved said one London-based analyst It's like getting turkeys to vote for Christmas  The CME's revenues last year net of securities lending interest expenses were $387 2m an increase of 70 9 per cent from $226 6m in the same period in 2000 Net income for 2001 was $68 3m compared to a net loss of $5 9m in 2000 ,2
2002-06-18, Imperial ChemicalIndustries yesterday severed the last big link to a past in bulk chemicals when it agreed to sell its remaining interest in Huntsman International to CSFB Global Opportunities Partners The deal came as a surprise the company had planned to sell the 30 per cent stake to Huntsman Group of the US which paid £1 7bn for 60 per cent of the venture in 1999 However the US group's financial problems had delayed completion Some analysts said the deal which values the stake at a net $430m £291m payable over the next 12 months was less generous than the Huntsman agreement But it had the advantage of bringing in hard cash to debt-laden ICI That is the price they are paying for getting out quickly and cleanly and mitigating risk said Peter Cartwright at Williams de Broe The global downturn in bulk chemicals has pushed Huntsman International into the red knocking £12m or 15 per cent off ICI's first- quarter profits this year The sale is forecast to enhance ICI's earnings by about 5 per cent or 1p this year taking expectations from 24p to 25p for 2002 and from 27p to 28p for 2003 Analysts said ICI would be able to deconsolidate its stake in Huntsman International immediately It also gets the cash injection from the divestment CSFB has already paid $160m of the acquisition costs and has taken ownership of ICI's loan notes in Huntsman International The remaining $280m is payable by May 15 2003 in exchange for ICI's 30 per cent shareholding At $430m the total net value of the deal is slightly greater than the $365m plus potential interest of $33m ICI was due to earn from the previous divestment agreement struck last December However under that deal ICI would have kept the loan notes The net book value of the shareholding and the loan notes at December last year was £228m Huntsman International was ICI's last bulk chemicals business following the radical shift of direction begun in the mid-1990s into so-called speciality chemicals with consumer applications The shares closed up 7p at 292p See Lombard,1
2002-04-30, Yoriko Kawaguchi Japan's foreign minister is heading to Iran this week in a fresh diplomatic attempt to engage a country that has been branded part of the axis of evil by US President George W Bush Mrs Kawaguchi said she would try to encourage the reformist elements in the Iranian government to seek a new relationship with the outside world We have had good communications with Iran and I think it is important that Iran is not isolated she said in an interview with the FT We would like to continue to have a dialogue with Iran  Mrs Kawaguchi's mission has received the informal blessing of the US administration which has been keen to open back-door communications with Tehran Mr Bush first discussed Japan's involvement in such a role when he visited Tokyo in February UK and Italian ministers have also been used in recent months to convey Washington's position to Tehran The recently appointed Japanese foreign minister praised Iran for supporting the peace process in Afghanistan Mrs Kawaguchi also noted that Iran had been instrumental in helping to develop the Kyoto environmental protocol But Mrs Kawaguchi said she would raise the international community's concerns about Tehran's development of weapons of mass destruction and arms proliferation Senior US administration officials said Mr Bush had asked the Japanese government to communicate these concerns to the Iranians The US has also become increasingly concerned about Iran's links to anti Israeli terrorism as well as its ties with the al-Qaeda terrorist network Historically Japan has had close relations with Iran and believes it can play a useful role as an intermediary Tokyo is pursuing a similar policy towards North Korea which has also been included in the axis of evil by the US administration Mrs Kawaguchi said that a new mood was developing on the Korean peninsula as dialogue resumed between the two Korean states and the US Mrs Kawaguchi said Japan was becoming more active in international affairs although the country remained firmly wedded to its peace constitution which prevents offensive military action This partly reflected the foreign policy priorities of Junichiro Koizumi prime minister but also a new mood of realism in Japan following the terrorist attacks on the US on September 11 We are thinking about our contribution in international society and Japanese public sentiment gives us more tools she said Mrs Kawaguchi is first stopping in Afghanistan where she will lend her support to the efforts to consolidate the peace We ourselves reconstructed our country after the war and we have 50 years of expertise and experience she said The Japanese foreign minister said she would explore ways of easing the reporting restrictions on the interim Afghan administration imposed by international aid agencies Hamid Karzai the head of the interim administration recently complained that his bureaucracy was being swamped by such requests But she said it was important to ensure transparency and accountability in the international aid programme We have to balance these two demands but I do appreciate the problem that Karzai is having ,3
2002-04-20, Vivendi Environnement the French utilities company yesterday moved to centre stage in the political drama over its parent company Investors concluded that Vivendi Universal was poised to sell a large stake while the French state was preparing to buy shares in Vivendi Environnement to keep them out of foreign hands Electricite de France the acquisitive state electricity monopoly denied a report that it had bought Vivendi Environnement shares earlier this week But analysts greeted the denial with scepticism given EdF's record of obfuscation about its previous deals across Europe They've denied buying shares but they have not denied an interest said a utilities analyst at CAI Cheuvreux in Paris yesterday Vivendi Environnement shares rose more than 4 per cent early yesterday before settling back to end the day up 1 3 per cent at {XEU}37 99 Jean-Marie Messier the Vivendi Universal chief executive under fire in France for his handling of television subsidiary Canal Plus is anxious to reduce the parent group's stake in Vivendi Environnement from 63 per cent to below 50 per cent so that he can deconsolidate {XEU}14bn $12 4bn of debt Under an agreement with the French tax authorities a sale of shares before 2003 would incur a heavy tax penalty but this could be offset against tax credits arising from losses at Vivendi Universal's other businesses Analysts say Mr Messier's options include breaking up Vivendi Environnement or selling a 15 per cent stake to a group of banks which could then sell on the shares to another buyer Caisse des Depots et Consignations the state-controlled bank declined to comment yesterday on suggestions that it was buying shares in the utilities company Mr Messier has been constrained by the failure to remove Henri Proglio the Vivendi Environnement chief executive and replace him with his own associate Eric Licoys Resistance from the board and the French political establishment proved too much for Mr Messier With a series of French election contests starting tomorrow French politicians have expressed horror at the idea of Vivendi Environnement falling under foreign control the company provides water to nearly half France's households and has long had close ties to local politicians across the country We must be very careful that this company does not fall into the wrong hands President Jacques Chirac said this week EdF is seen in France as an obvious candidate to buy into Vivendi Environnement although there are doubts about how much money it can raise for the operation The two companies already have a joint venture in Dalkia the energy services company and EdF is seeking a vehicle to list its international electricity assets as a prelude to partial privatisation ,1
2002-06-13, Buffett sees no equities boost Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive does not expect the stock market to improve with the economy he said in an interview with financial news network CNBC People who believe that the market will go up because the economy has picked up have not followed history Mr Buffett said From 1964 to 1981 the Dow Jones Industrial Average barely rose while the US economy grew a lot he said The market's decline has created opportunities for Berkshire Hathaway he said We're more likely to find something now than when the S&P was 1400 And we're more likely to find it when the LBO firms aren't as aggressive as they were or can't borrow as much money  Mr Buffett said he did not expect any asset class to significantly outperform the market He was looking at businesses he had been interested in all along which are now at prices that make sense to his company Berkshire Hathaway would probably do pretty well this year after getting killed last year he said Bloomberg,2
2002-04-04, The saddest tax scam of the new millennium is the so-called slavery reparations tax credit or black tax rebate In recent years a number of tax professionals or purported tax professionals have told African-American citizens that they are legally entitled to some form of tax relief as compensation for wrongs against their ancestors during the period of slavery in the US This however is complete fantasy Thus the Internal Revenue Service finds itself in the position of reporting that Gregory Bridge a Virginia accountant was sentenced to 57 months in prison for filing false returns and advising black taxpayers that they were entitled to special tax breaks In addition to arguing that there is such a thing as reparation for blacks via the tax code fraudulent tax advisers are apparently leaning on the phrase black tax which students of modern culture use to describe the hidden costs of residual racial discrimination In this instance the scamsters are presenting a figurative tax as a literal one and promoting a rebate to go along with it The black tax credit is no small story The IRS said it received nearly 80000 claims for slavery reparations in 2001 Taxpayers asked for a total of $2 7bn in refunds Promoters are shamelessly preying upon people IRS Commissioner Charles O Rossotti has said The IRS is furious And no wonder In hearings before Congress a couple of years ago the agency got raked over the coals for auditing a high proportion of lower earners This wasn't really the IRS's fault The problem lay with the Earned Income Tax Credit a generous programme for lower earners that is so complicated and tempting that many citizens abused it intentionally or unintentionally Now the same scenario confronts the IRS again If it is to police the black tax scam effectively it will have to audit lower-earning Americans And nobody likes to make poor lawyerless people miserable not even IRS agents Filers who fail to refile after the IRS rejects their fraudulent claim will be hit by a $500 frivolous filing charge Ouch All this though begs the question of why black citizens actually believe the scamsters One reason is clearly that many are not familiar with the workings of US tax law But that likely isn't the whole story I think the answer here is that the tax code today offers so many socially oriented giveaways and breaks that this one didn't seem so unusual There are for example any number tax breaks for victims of September 11 There are tax breaks for anthrax victims There are tax breaks available for the relatives of those who died in the Oklahoma City office building There are supposedly endless tax breaks for specific subsets of big business In the case of the black tax scam there is also the fact that many black leaders have called for reparations to the black community for slavery Indeed this past week the first lawsuit was launched against a US company Aetna the insurer seeking reparations Among those politicians discussing reparations is Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas Her constituents or constituents of the Black Caucus generally have heard so much about reparations that it seemed possible to them that a black tax break might already exist After the black tax scams multiplied Ms Johnson had to put out a statement to tell taxpayers that there was no black tax break All of which tells us it is time to reconsider what the tax code is for In the past taxes used to be only for collecting revenue If lawmakers wanted to be humane they wrote welfare entitlements These days however the tax engine has supplanted the entitlement engine as the nation's premier social machine The result is a code so complicated and irrational that it takes on a lottery-like feel rather akin to the feel of modern-day no-holds- barred litigation The game is big and scary but taxpayers and plaintiffs suspect also may yield up giant prizes Indeed in the black tax scam we have a rare thing which is the conflation of two troubled aspects of US culture the litigation explosion and the tax explosion Matters are made worse by the fact that some injury awards or settlements physical injuries for example are not taxable says Harry Hives of law firm Covington & Burling Winners cash in in two lotteries Neither of these lotteries is going to go away until lawmakers make clear to voters what lawsuits and taxation are really about In the case of lawsuits this means meaningful tort reform In the case of taxation it means restoring the code to something closer to a simple revenue engine Paul O'Neill the Treasury Secretary has been lately suggesting exactly that If there's a silver lining to the reparations tax scam it is that it makes clear tax reform is in the interest of every person black or white ,3
2002-06-24, A group of the world's biggest investors is poised to agree international ground rules for limiting excessive pay deals for top executives The International Corporate Governance Network representing investors with $10000bn £6677bn of assets is to consider radical proposals to clamp down on the reward of stock options and to ban cash bonuses for M&A activity at its annual summit in Milan in July The move comes amid unrest among shareholders of Vodafone the UK telecommunications giant that last week paid Sir Christopher Gent its chief executive a £1 5bn bonus even though the company's share price has fallen dramatically in recent months The rules have been drawn up by an ICGN committee on executive remuneration chaired by Alistair Ross Goobey former chief executive of Hermes Pension Management the UK fund manager and a longstanding opponent of excessive pay for directors He said there was a post-Enron consensus among investors and companies about tackling directors' pay The only good thing to come out of the Enron affair is that people are realising that there is something broken in the system he said The seven-person committee includes a senior executive at GlaxoSmithKline whose chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier was embroiled in a pay crisis two years ago when as head of SmithKline he was offered options worth 20 times his base salary International investors are unhappy about the spiralling costs of directors In the US directors' stock options rose from barely 10 per cent of pre-tax profits to nearly 20 per cent in the period 1998-2000 In the UK the pay gap between directors and their employees widened by more than 50 per cent between 1994 and 2001 The committee was unimpressed with claims that there is a global market for top executives That is so much hooey said Mr Ross Goobey It was also unhappy that executives were rewarded on the basis of the size of the organisation In its report the committee cited a survey by Arthur Andersen showing that directors of UK-listed companies valued at up to £500m were given a base salary of £280000 a year By contrast companies valued at more than £32bn gave directors a base salary of nearly £800000 a year The committee agreed that there is an implicit incentive to seek to increase the size of the companies through bids and mergers Mr Ross Goobey said there had been fears that the com mittee with a mix of corporate executives head hunters and investors would put forward proposals that settled around the lowest common denominator But corporations are worried about excessive pay too The committee agreed that very high pay may if taken to extremes undermine the morale and pay structures    or create such competition for the top job the only one with excessive compensation that succession politics rather than business management is the order of the day Under the proposals share options would have a limited use They would not be the only means of creating long-term incentives nor would they be issued in one large batch If as is proposed they were issued regularly there would be no need for them to be re-priced In addition transaction bonuses such as the one given to Sir Christopher Gent after the completion of Vodafone's acquisition of Germany's Mannesmann would not be allowed The committee agreed that  The base salary as well as other payments and benefits should be published  The true cost of stock options and other benefits should be charged to the revenue account  The remuneration report should be presented as a separate voting item at every annual meeting ,2
2002-06-27, Another accounting scandal another bad day on global stock markets News that WorldCom had overstated cash flow for the past five quarters by $3 8bn £2 5bn sent shares sharply down Improper accounting for expenses has joined off-balance-sheet debt and revenue manipulation on the list of investor concerns The offence may be new but the underlying causes remain the same as do the responses needed to restore confidence Expenses manipulation is even older than the inflation of revenues that proved so attractive to growing technology and energy companies The practice is well known to accountants which makes the exculpatory statement by Andersen WorldCom's auditor all the more astounding The firm said WorldCom's chief financial officer had not told it of the manipulation of expenses or sought its approval Yet what is the purpose of an audit if it is not to ask questions about hefty transfers in the accounts The manipulation involved more than $3bn of expenses last year compared with a reported profit of $1 4bn Someone on the audit team should have spotted that and someone should have checked the existence of the assets normal practice only a few years ago Investors were certainly not gulled by Andersen's disingenuous statement After Enron they sold shares in any company that appeared to employ special purpose entities used by the oil trader to hide debt Yesterday institutions were selling shares in companies audited by Andersen which was also the auditor for Enron and Global Crossing Andersen's dwindling band of audit clients will dwindle faster So too should confidence in fashionable measures of business success such as earnings before interest taxation depreciation and amortisation ebitda The WorldCom scam moved expenses from above ebitda in the cash flow analysis to below it boosting the figure beloved by many in the technology boom Investors need to look at all aspects of performance not just earnings before the bad stuff President George W Bush has pledged a full investigation of the WorldCom case but there is no need to wait for its conclusion to act The reforms already proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission to improve audit regulation need strengthening for example by forbidding auditors from offering other services to clients WorldCom paid Andersen $12 4m last year for such services compared with $4 4m for the audit an unacceptable conflict of interest The New York Stock Exchange proposals to bolster corporate governance should also insist on rotation of auditors to prevent cosy relationships undermining the integrity of the audit Andersen had been WorldCom's auditor since 1989 a periodic change of firm might have led to more serious questioning of the accounts Last it is time for US accounting standards to move away from prescriptive rule-making towards the alternative used in many other countries which focuses on substance over form US regulators have been suspicious of principles-based standards drafted by the International Accounting Standards Board arguing that the US approach is superior As the list of US accounting scandals mounts it is hard to maintain such a position ,2
2002-04-30, Franz Fischler European agriculture and fisheries commissioner yesterday ruled out significant changes to his plans to reform the European Union's much-maligned fisheries policy The controversial proposals were put on ice last week for a month following the intervention of Jose Maria Aznar Spanish prime minister However Mr Fischler said yesterday he had not changed his mind about the need for radical change I am absolutely not prepared to water down the proposal On substance there will be no change Mr Fischler said He added that the delay would be used to provide more data about the need for reform and its socio-economic consequences Spain has combined with a group of EU states including France Italy Greece Portugal and Ireland to lobby against Mr Fischler's proposals which aim to cut the size of the EU fishing fleet through an emergency scrapping programme and by stopping EU subsidies being used to increase capacity Spain is the main beneficiary of the {XEU}1 1bn £670m $960m spent on the Common Fisheries Policy each year The fishing lobby is strong in southern European states which fear a political backlash if the reforms lead to big job losses The issue has caused controversy in Brussels following suggestions that a number of countries had called on their European Commissioners to force Mr Fischler to amend his proposals Commissioners are not supposed to take instructions from national capitals Mr Fischler's proposals come amid growing evidence that EU fish stocks are in crisis The Commission believes the EU fleet is 40 per cent too big Besides measures to cut the size of the fleet Mr Fischler wants to replace the annual quota-setting negotiations with a multi-annual approach tighten control and surveillance and do more to protect young fish ,3
2002-04-18, Ford Motor Company yesterday reported a net loss of $800m for the first quarter as weakening US sales and continued restructuring charges undermined the world's second largest carmaker The losses contrasting with a $1 13bn profit in the same period of 2001 were inflated by $708m in goodwill writedowns mainly for Ford's Kwik-Fit subsidiary which is being sold as part of a sweeping restructuring The company also said that its core automotive operations lost $310m in the first three months of the year compared with a $748m gain last time amid higher marketing costs and lower output in the US Nevertheless gains at its European operations and earnings at Ford Credit the finance arm helped contain underlying operating losses at $108m or 6 cents a share At that level the losses were at the lower end of consensus analysts' expectations put at 15 cents a share Shares in Ford rose 2 per cent or 33 cents to $16 19 in lunchtime trading after it predicted it could out-perform market expectations again in the second quarter with earnings of 23 cents a share Ford expects to make 130000 more vehicles in the second quarter over the first quarter as it restocks to fill solid US demand and gets better efficiency from factories But executives warned that the second half was still uncertain and challenging The figures contrasting with sharply improved profits at General Motors this week underlined the need for Ford's restructuring The company announced earlier this year it would cut 22000 jobs in North America and close five plants to reverse losses of $5 45bn last year and return to strong profits by mid-decade That restructuring is modelled closely on Ford's revival in Europe where it posted earnings of $117m in the first quarter up from $88m last time Nevertheless many analysts remain concerned about Ford's short-term outlook in the US where it is facing an incentive war from a revived GM and over-capacity in the industry Operational strength varies considerably and that leads us to argue strongly for a preference for buying GM shares over Ford and DaimlerChrysler said Saul Rubin analyst at UBS Warburg in recent research Ford executives said the company's restructuring plan remained on schedule delivering savings of $700 per vehicle by 2005 Nick Scheele chief operating officer said We will know by the fourth quarter Is the velocity in the pipeline appropriate to deliver the $700 Ford estimates its costs will start falling next year It added that it was one-third of the way through its plan to sell $1bn in non-core assets this year www ft com/ford,2
2002-06-29, The ferry sails for an hour up the Pearl River from Hong Kong before docking at a nondescript wharf flanked by one or two small container ships The passengers emerge from the grey terminal building into acres of empty lots punctuated by a four-lane highway with no cars on it The distant hills with their lush lychee plantations offer the only relief from the drab landscape It might not look like much but this is Nansha island the latest supposed threat to Hong Kong's economic dominance of the Pearl river delta region southern China's manufacturing stronghold Guangzhou capital of Guangdong province has grand plans to build a 40- berth deep-water port here with room for 50000-tonne ships A government promotional video sums up the idea behind the proposal Big port drives big industries it enthuses Five years after its handover to China Hong Kong's commercial integration with its manufacturing hinterland across the border in Guangdong is proceeding apace Hong Kong companies have 6000 factories in the delta region and account for 72 per cent of foreign direct investment in Guangdong But while businessmen on both sides of the border are working together as closely as ever there are signs the delta's governments are finding co-operation more difficult particularly when it comes to forging a cohesive economic vision for the region The biggest concern is duplication of infrastructure as local governments throughout the delta try to replicate Hong Kong's economic model Nowhere is this more apparent than in transport and logistics a crucial industry for Hong Kong where re-exports goods shipped through the territory to third countries are worth about 105 per cent of GDP There are nine big container ports within 150km of Hong Kong and four major airports many of which are racing to add capacity The mainland ports are rapidly stealing market share from Hong Kong whose port fees are up to 1 4 times higher than those in Guangdong Sea freight turnover in the territory has fallen 3 5 per cent a year since 1997 Hong Kong has been able to compensate the shortfall by shipping more air freight with volumes growing 10 per cent a year over the past five years The territory has an advantage in aviation because of extensive air treaties negotiated with foreign governments largely during colonial times That has not stopped cities in Guangdong however from building new airports even at the risk of them becoming white elephants Zuhai in the western Pearl river area built a new airport in 1995 with a capacity of 14m passengers a year Last year there were only 600000 passengers Not to be outdone Guangzhou is quadrupling its airport Despite criticism about duplication Guangzhou is unapologetic Zhang Guang Ning the vice mayor says China's late patriarch Deng Xiaoping who devised the 'One Country Two Systems' policy under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy never intended to give the territory priority over the rest of the delta It One Country Two Systems was aimed at helping Hong Kong's economy to develop better and faster It does not mean that the neighbouring cities should stop and let Hong Kong develop alone Mr Zhang said He argues that some competition within the delta particularly in transport and logistics is good if it forces Hong Kong to cut its costs The high costs in Hong Kong will slow down economic development in the whole region so we won't be able to compete with Shanghai in the future he says The Guangzhou government and its main partner in Nansha Hong Kong businessman Henry Fok are determined to push ahead with their proposals for the island Aside from the port they are planning a large logistics centre and an IT park In an attempt to tap into Hong Kong's lucrative conference business they have already built a 100000- square metre conference and exhibition centre by the riverbank To try to grab the Hong Kong tourist dollar they have also built a waterside village modelled on Suzhou the famous ancient Chinese city and a high-rise Tianhou Goddess of the Sea temple The only problem is no one seems to be coming almost all the facilities including the conference centre are empty The promotional video promises that foreign investors' projects in Nansha will blossom and bear fine fruit But virtually the only fruit ripening in Nansha in the near future will be the lychees on its distant hills This is the second article in a series of three marking the fifth anniversary of the former British colony's return to China ,3
2002-06-19, Vodafone is today set to defy its shareholders by announcing a substantial pay deal for Sir Christopher Gent chief executive of the UK telecommunications group Sir Christopher is expected to be given a £1 5m share award and a substantial new option deal The package will be greeted with dismay among critics of excessive boardroom pay who believe companies are failing to take account of corporate performance Today's pay details come in spite of a sharp fall in Vodafone's share price and its announcement last month of the biggest loss in UK corporate history Sir Christopher was granted the £1 5m bonus following Vodafone's takeover of Mannesmann in Germany two years ago At the time the payout was worth £10m half of which he has already received It is also understood that the group is to disregard pleas from shareholders to restrict the use of share options Sir Christopher will receive an option package which will give him the right to buy shares at a price around current levels This price which has yet to be determined will be considerably less than their price at the peak of the telecommunications boom when Vodafone traded at close to 400p Last night the shares closed at near their four-year low down 3p at 93 25p By contrast Deutsche Telekom the German telecoms operator announced yesterday it was scrapping board members' options this year and halving the number of options allocated to senior managers in a bid to deflect growing criticism over directors' pay Vodafone declined to comment beyond saying pay details would be in the annual report published today and voted on next month The remuneration policy will be put to a vote at the annual meeting on July 31 One shareholder said reaction to the package would depend on the performance targets The devil is in the detail he said After a series of rows with shareholders on executive pay over two years the group has been anxious to avoid a repeat of shareholder revolts For its new package it has assiduously sought shareholders' views The company is expected to respond with tougher targets for directors to receive share options and bonuses Despite Vodafone last month reporting a £13 5bn loss after nearly £20bn of writedowns and other charges related to acquisitions supporters of Sir Christopher are likely to argue that Vodafone remains one of the strongest groups in its sector with one of the most robust balance sheets At Deutsche Telekom the eight board members have agreed not to claim their allocation of 1 7m options this year while the 6 5m options earmarked for 3000 top managers under a five-year incentive plan will be cut by half At yesterday's share price the board's options would have been worth {XEU}17 5m Editorial Comment Page 22 MMO{2} sets prices for 3G Page 25 Lombard Page 26 www ft com/telecoms,2
2002-06-07, The appointment of a tough industrialist as finance minister could scarcely be a more potent symbol of President Jacques Chirac's desire to overhaul economic policy and create a more business-friendly environment in France For his first month in office Francis Mer the former boss of Arcelor the steel group has been able to do little save prepare his plans should the rightwing parties backing the newly re-elected Mr Chirac win the parliamentary elections But the moment for action is close with the right poised to win this two-round contest which begins on Sunday and ends on June 16 If the right wins a clear parliamentary majority it will have a historic opportunity over the next five years to carry out the kind of economic reforms successive French governments of the right have failed to implement This in turn would have a significant impact on the other main economies of continental Europe Germany and Italy are wrestling with similar problems of labour rigidity investment confidence public spending controls and the overhang of costly state-run pension schemes with increasingly aged populations Chirac is good at gestures and knows perfectly well what needs to be done especially if he wants to go down in the history books as a reformer says a member of the outgoing Socialist-led government But he warns Chirac is above all a political animal and may not give Mer and other ministers the support they need should things go wrong  Already Mr Chirac has saddled the interim government of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin with a set of promises from his presidential campaign that will be difficult to balance With one hand he has pledged a big cut in taxes over the next five years and with the other he is committed to raise spending on fighting crime and defence These promises assume the economy grows an annual average of 3 per cent But this year growth will at best touch 1 5 per cent against the backdrop of a hesitant recovery and an uncertain international environment France also has to respect stability pact undertakings with its eurozone partners whereby it will bring the budget close to balance by 2004 However the budget deficit is already heading well above 2 per cent of gross domestic product this year against earlier projections of no more than 1 9 per cent Mr Mer has ordered an audit of the public accounts by the end of the month But economists believe Mr Chirac's promise to balance the books cannot be met without big spending cuts Aware of the political difficulties this presents Mr Mer yesterday caused a stir by declaring that the stability pact is not cast in stone and could easily be revised In broad policy terms he wants to shift the emphasis away from the left's stoking of domestic consumption and towards the supply-side He hopes to regenerate investment confidence by easing employment overheads loosening the rules on youth employment and allowing greater flexibility for overtime to offset the effects of the 35-hour week notably for smaller businesses On spending the new government will seek economies by transferring a number of central government expenditure items to local authorities while making the latter more accountable for their outlays As an industrialist Mr Mer is also devoting attention too much according to his critics to reorganising and limiting the state presence in its numerous holdings in defence energy transport and telecommunications Privatisation an emotive word has not been mentioned during the general election campaign But plans to sell state assets will become an important signal of intent over the coming months EdF the electricity giant which has aroused the concern of Brussels by its predatory investment across Europe may not be first on the block but some form of divestiture seems inevitable The other signal will be a move to overhaul the public administration perhaps beginning with the finance ministry the object of a failed attempt at reform under the last government As of 2005 an exodus of civil servants will begin with more than 60 per cent of the current workforce in retirement by 2015 This presents a unique chance to redefine jobs and make savings through non-replacement But it also highlights the huge pending problem of retirement pensions which any new government knows has to be tackled The pay-as-you-go state-run pensions system is unsustainable without both extending the contribution period and raising the retirement age beyond 60 Yet before any change is made the government first has to address the generous pension provision made for public sector employees The unions have promised a battle Those close to Mr Chirac insist he is willing to confront the pensions issue He has an added incentive because the spectacular mishandling of attempts to reform railway pensions in 1996-97 by his protege and premier Alain Juppe was a prime reason for the right losing the elections in 1997 However Mr Chirac has yet to prove he can restrict himself to making campaign pledges he is able to keep Already the government is wondering how to honour his call for an immediate 5 per cent cut in income tax this year and for further cuts of 30 per cut over five years Concessions to that half of the electorate who pay taxes will upset low-income groups who will not benefit and increase pressure to raise the minimum wage by more than the rate of inflation Companies may judge an increase in the minimum wage a poor exchange for promises of a reduction in other employment overheads Already questions are being asked about how the government intends to fund this week's concessions to striking doctors Part of the {XEU}1bn $950m annual bill will probably have to be paid through higher social security contributions As the previous Jospin government found domestic constraints combined with the external demands of the single currency leave only a small margin for manoeuvre Business-friendly initiatives such as Mr Mer's appointment risk creating false optimism Mr Chirac has made a lot of promises during the campaign in office he may give with one hand but take away with the other ,3

2002-06-15, Paolo Fresco the chairman and chief executive of Fiat Group has told employees of Italy's industrial flagship that its financial position has been undermined by weakening market demand and deteriorating cash- flow In a memo to 260000 employees Mr Fresco said the group was embarking on a number of disposals to cut its {XEU}6 6bn $6 3bn net debts while also bolstering sales of products and services At the group level we must bring to fruition financial transactions to cut indebtedness drastically and we must do it within the deadlines we have committed to he said The internal letter marks Mr Fresco's first statement to employees following the resignation this week of Paolo Cantarella as group chief executive Mr Cantarella announced he was standing down amid mounting pressure over Fiat's finances and losses at its core carmaking division prompting a sweeping restructuring and refinancing of the group Fiat declined to elaborate on the memo The Fiat chairman who also assumed Mr Cantarella's role earlier this week is thought to have discussed the group's strategy in New York this week with Jack Welch former chairman of General Electric and a non-executive director at Fiat Mr Welch is acting as a strategic consultant to Fiat Mr Fresco a former vice-chairman of GE was in New York yesterday to attend a board meeting of the US group In his memo to Fiat employees he reiterated that Mr Cantarella had quit to signal a clean break with the past While regretting his departure the chairman said the Fiat board fully understood the challenges facing the company The group has been severely penalised in the markets in which it operates he wrote Because our capital investment cannot be fully funded from cashflow our financial position has deteriorated  Fiat has insisted that its debt-reduction strategy was not a precursor to the possible future disposal of Fiat Auto its core division to General Motors GM Fiat's alliance partner already controls 20 per cent of that business In his memo Mr Fresco told employees that Fiat had a strategy in place to achieve its cashflow-generating and profitability targets We have charted a course We must now follow it without wavering he concluded ,2
2002-06-12, Munich Re long regarded as the sleeping giant of German finance is on the march Flush with cash and with a core reinsurance business that is finally on the up the world's biggest reinsurer is fast becoming one of corporate Germany's movers and shakers Driven by long-term shifts in the European financial sector Hans-Jurgen Schinzler group chairman since 1993 has steadily pushed Munich Re into new markets and businesses turning it from a conservative reinsurer into a fast expanding financial services group It is now Germany's second biggest primary insurer through subsidiary Ergo after completing a series of asset swaps with near neighbour and rival Allianz in the 1990s In 1999 it set up fund manager Meag which has more than {XEU}120bn in assets under management Last year it again swapped assets with Allianz as part of the insurer's {XEU}23bn takeover of Dresdner Bank Germany's third largest bank That deal gave it a 26 per cent stake in HVB and an effective management veto at Germany's second biggest bank At the end of last year it announced far reaching moves to boost the cross selling of banking and insurance products between Ergo and HVB At the beginning of this year it surprised markets by revealing it had acquired a 10 4 per cent stake in Commerzbank Germany's fourth largest bank Now the group is about to reap the benefits of an upturn in the reinsurance market where cut throat competition has long depressed premium rates and profitability By tragic coincidence reinsurance insuring the insurers has been given an enormous boost by the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US The cataclysmic events left Munich Re with a loss of {XEU}2 1bn the biggest single loss in the group's 120-year history and the world's insurers facing claims in excess of {XEU}50bn But it also helped to create probably the best conditions the reinsurance market has faced for 30 years Munich Re has been able to raise prices and renegotiate much of its reinsurance cover Group executives insist further big price rises are necessary if the reinsurance industry is to improve its fundamental profitability In particular triple A-rated Munich Re believes its top notch financial solidity should allow it to charge a top price To underline the point Clement Booth a board member says the group is prepared to walk away from business if it is not priced adequately During this year's renewals season Munich Re says it cancelled about 20 per cent of its business The upswing in the market comes at a time when Munich Re is overhauling businesses and coming under increasing investor pressure to deliver on the earnings targets it has set It is restructuring its large portfolio of shareholdings taking advantage of the abolition of capital gains tax to release capital for investment in core businesses and build up shareholder value Last year it was at the centre of the shake-up of Germany's financial sector triggered by Allianz's acquisition of Dresdner The deal enabled Munich Re to lift its stake in life assurer Ergo from 63 to 95 per cent The push into primary insurance has been driven by the need to diversify earnings and compensate for the volatility of reinsurance income Primary insurance now accounts for about half of total premium income The financial sector shake-up in Germany which comes in response to the growth in private savings in the wake of pension reform also left Munich Re with a big stake in HVB The two have stepped up the cross-selling of insurance and banking products and work together on corporate pension plans likely to be the fastest growing part of Germany's new private pensions market Munich Re has repeatedly denied suggestions that it might follow Allianz's example and take full control of a bank It insists it is content to co-operate with its banking partner But the group fuelled a flurry of market rumours earlier this year when it announced it had doubled its stake in Commerzbank to 10 4 per cent It said the stake put it in a strong position to observe developments at Commerzbank and the rest of the banking sector where overcapacity and weak markets have depressed profitability The move was seen as a clever gambit that would enable the reinsurer to block predatory moves against its interests At the same time Munich Re would be able to steer the bank towards a tie-up of its choice It could even attempt to push Commerzbank into a deal with HVB strengthening the Munich bank's number two position in the German market and creating a formidable bancassurance rival to Allianz and Dresdner For the moment however a move is thought unlikely With the reinsurance market recovering Germany's troubled banks remain something of a sideshow But Munich Re is now eyeing all its options and with no shortage of resources it is unlikely investors will have to wait long for its next move Tony Major,2
2002-04-22, Poor countries have massively scaled back their demands on a fledgling international global fund set up to combat Aids and other killer diseases because of a lack of money available Campaigners say the fund to combat HIV-Aids tuberculosis and malaria whose governing board will meet in New York to make the first round of awards this week is at a critical juncture in establishing its credibility The fund has received bids totalling $1 15bn £795m for its first year This outstrips the $700m-$800m available this year out of a three-year total of $1 9bn pledged by governments and other donors But experts and officials have told the FT that these applications had already been sharply reduced because of lack of time and money Countries were given only six weeks to complete their bids for the first round of awards Biziwick Mwale head of the national Aids commission in Malawi told the FT We scaled down our proposal because of the size of the global fund There were lots of rumours flying round saying 'if your proposal is too big forget about it'  He said that rich donor countries had told him to reduce the size of his application though declined to name them Malawi's bid requests $306m over five years but Mr Mwale said that $1 6bn was a more realistic figure for the country's needs Sixteen per cent of Malawi's adult population is estimated to be HIV positive with 70000 deaths a year from Aids The Nigerian application to the fund notes the limited time available and makes it clear that its application by no means represents the full range of need in Nigeria Josh Ruxin director of Harvard University's access project for the global fund said This board meeting should present a huge opportunity to start real action on combating these killer diseases but there is an enormous gap between the funds available and the need on the ground  Kofi Annan United Nations secretary-general has estimated the developing world needs $7bn-$10bn a year to combat Aids alone Melanie Zipperer communications officer for the fund said the fund was not intended to provide all the money necessary to tackle the three diseases She admitted there had been insufficient time for countries to prepare applications but said she was unaware of any tension about the size of bids The fund launched at the Group of Eight summit in Genoa last year under the auspices of the United Nations has struggled with criticism by some ministers such as Clare Short the UK development minister and by some non-governmental organisations such as Christian Aid for raising unrealistic expectations and bypassing existing health and funding systems But it has proved far more popular in the US which has a strong network of domestic Aids campaigners http//www globalfundatm org/,1
2002-04-23, Lukoil Russia's largest oil company yesterday unveiled an ambitious restructuring plan designed to boost shareholder confidence before a planned offer by the government of 5 9 per cent of the company's shares By increasing exports cutting costs and streamlining its corporate structure Lukoil expects to increase net profits by $500m a year over the next two to three years said Leonid Fedun vice-president Lukoil had net profits of $1 94bn in the first nine months of 2001 the most recent data available Analysts said that the announcement demonstrated Lukoil's growing awareness of the importance of communicating with investors Lukoil's market capitalisation has fallen well below that of its smaller rival Yukos partly because Yukos has been quicker to adopt western methods of investor relations Steve Allen an oil analyst at Russian investment bank Troika Dialog said the restructuring plan was more than a matter of image He described a meeting with analysts attended by Vagit Alekperov Lukoil president as a breakthrough in that it was an admission that the company had fallen behind its peers They've never admitted before that they had a cost problem Mr Allen said He said the most realistic points in the plan were measures to cut costs and improve efficiency including spinning off the company's drilling business abandoning less profitable wells and reducing staff from 140000 to 115000 by 2005 and 85000 by 2010 Mr Allen said he was much less confident that Lukoil would meet its ambitious production target of 140m-160m tonnes a year by 2010 roughly double the 78 3m tonnes Lukoil produced last year The increase would come initially from better exploitation of fields and drilling in the company's Timan Pechora fields in northern Russia followed by exploitation of the northern Caspian in the second half of the decade Mr Fedun said The government which holds about 14 per cent of Lukoil has said it would offer the 5 9 per cent stake in June or July likely in London in the form of depositary receipts Morgan Stanley and KPMG are advising the government Lukoil's shares dipped to $16 90 after the announcement from a peak of about $17 50 ,2
2002-06-04, Motorola the mobile phone maker said yesterday it had renewed its credit lines early and had completed a $1 8bn refinancing with a syndicate of banks The refinancing comes as the company seeks to bolster its financial position Its credit rating has fallen two notches to A3 since the start of 2001 and the company was placed on review for possible downgrade in December 2001 by Moody's Investors Service Motorola has however been taking steps to cut back on capital spending and has sold investments It has also cut back on its debt and now has only around $500m in short-term commercial paper borrowings Its consolidated cash cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are about $6bn the company said yesterday Motorola's new bank lines which renew an existing $2 5bn line consist of a one-year $900m line of credit and a three-year $900m line The company declined to disclose the names of the refinancing syndicate banks ,1
1998-04-01, Russia's leftwing-dominated parliament yesterday stepped up its game of brinkmanship with the Kremlin threatening to block the nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko as prime minister unless the government agreed to consult it Parliamentary leaders decided that they would debate a controversial resolution today demanding that Boris Yeltsin meet the legislature's chiefs to discuss Mr Kiriyenko the inexperienced 35-year-old technocrat whom the president has named as head of the new government Even the pro-government Our Home is Russia faction led by the former prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin warned that if the parliament's voice were not heard now the legislature would oppose Mr Kiriyenko when his nomination came up for debate on Friday If the president responds positively to the Duma the lower house of the Russian parliament appeal this will considerably ease tensions and improve Kiriyenko's chances to be approved said Vladimir Ryzhkov deputy speaker of the Duma and a member of Our Home is Russia If consultations are not held Kiriyenko will be rejected on Friday  However the threats from the parliament which has a tradition of caving in to the president at the last minute appeared to have little impact on Mr Yeltsin He warned last week he would exercise his constitutional right to dissolve the legislature if it did not approve his choice All steps undertaken by the president are in strict compliance with the constitution Sergei Yastrzhembsky the Kremlin spokesman told Russian news agencies The Duma cannot have any claims on the president  Mr Yeltsin who stunned Russia last week by sacking his entire government yesterday continued to name ministers who will stay on in the new team In an announcement welcomed by investors he said that Mikhail Zadornov the highly respected finance minister would keep his job as would Yevgeny Primakov the hawkish but professional foreign minister Mr Kiriyenko whose nomination last week came as a surprise is expected today to continue lobbying the parliamentary factions His task could be complicated by revelations in the Russian media that he attended seminars of the Scientology religious group Over the past few days Russian newspapers have also dwelt upon Mr Kiriyenko's admission that his father is Jewish Even if it eventually caves in to Mr Yeltsin the parliament has hinted that it may prolong the stand-off Although the legislature is legally required to begin debating Mr Kiriyenko's candidacy on Friday a Communist leader said it was under no obligation to hold a vote on that day ,3
2002-06-01, AWG owner of Anglian Water is one step closer to completing its financial restructuring after holders of two of its bonds voted in favour of the plans Not enough of the holders of its remaining five bonds voted on the proposals yesterday so the vote will be held again in two weeks' time when the approval threshold drops from 75 per cent to 25 per cent AWG said it was disappointed that the votes did not go through the first time as it would slightly delay the restructuring process However it was confident of approval on June 17 The company still hoped to be able to return between £400m and £600m to its shareholders by September as it had originally intended to do In mid-June AWG will start a month-long marketing drive to persuade bond investors to buy £1 5bn worth of new bonds which it needs to complete its transition to a debt-financed company Relations between AWG and some bond investors were strained after the company was forced to offer higher levels of compensation to persuade the bondholders to back its plans AWG will rely on debt financing for its regulated water subsidiary which will be separated from its non-regulated businesses selling infrastructure construction and other services Although some bond investors said the company's handling of the restructuring process has depleted goodwill it remains to be seen whether the company will end up paying a premium for its new debt The driving factor behind the restructuring is to lower the cost of capital Poor results released this week might also affect its marketing The group plunged £53 5m into the red for the year to March 31 after bigger than expected exceptional charges of £174 3m Andrew Burton credit analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland said It won't be a straightforward roadshow partly because of the company's performance Some key individuals in the management team of the old company remain in the new structure which might concern investors  AWG admitted that it had been on a steep learning curve as far as bond investors were concerned Most of us had a lot of experience of the equity market and have been surprised by the arcane nature of the bond markets said Mike Keohane director of communications at AWG This week two other UK water companies said they had dropped plans for a debt restructuring with Pennon Group and Kelda ruling the process out ,2

2002-06-24, Few outsiders are as well equipped as former Fed governor Laurence Meyer to guess what the US central bank might do or not do next As policymakers at the Federal Reserve are scheduled to meet tomorrow and Wednesday Mr Meyer said a double-dip recession was unlikely but acknowledged the possibility Some speculators expect the Fed to consider for the first time this year cutting short-term interest rates to a new 40-year low Addressing emerging speculation of another rate cut Mr Meyer said The Fed won't need a recession If growth remains sub-par less than 3 per cent over a sustained period then you will get another easing All it will take is a concurrent rise in unemployment  In an interview with the Financial Times Mr Meyer also questioned speculation that the Fed would raise rates by September saying economic data which have been mixed and disappointing showing little or no inflation have not even begun to justify a rate increase He added that a rate cut could happen if economic growth remained anaemic There's virtually no chance of an interest-rate hike in June or August he said September is a possibility but the data has not even begun to support a move in September  Mr Meyer a highly regarded economic forecaster who was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1996 as a member of the Fed's board of governors resigned earlier this year and is now returning to his forecasting consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers Though in the past an inflation hawk he has always voted with the majority of the Fed's policy-making open market committee and recently shared his thoughts on the monetary and economic outlook He said the US economy probably grew no more than 2 per cent in the second quarter after surging nearly 6 per cent in the first He said America's ongoing hangover from the ill-fated investment binge of the late 1990s remained the single most important uncertainty hanging over the economic outlook The economy's recovery from last year's recession has been haphazard with housing strong consumer spending apparently slowing and business investment and hiring still depressed The recovery has appeared increasingly troubled in recent weeks as the stock market has sunk toward September 11 lows and reports have shown both production and sales of consumer goods the bulk of the economy were essentially flat last month after rising solidly through the first quarter Right now we're in a soft spot struggling toward a sub-par recovery Mr Meyer said And legitimate concerns have been raised as to whether the economy is gaining traction  While a renewed slide into recession was unlikely I wouldn't rule it out he said Still the most likely scenario in his view is that the economy will pick up steam in the second half of the year growing at an annual rate of 3 5 per cent in the second half and at 4 5 per cent next year Mr Meyer said futures markets which have reflected a relentless erosion since March in market expectations for any Fed rate increases this year were appropriately reacting to the economic data The stock market was working against a recovery he said Instead of the stock market leading and becoming a factor supporting it the recovery is dragging it along Mr Meyer said While he does not expect the market's travails to derail the resumption of solid growth there aren't too many post-recession precedents for this It's a very unusual situation he said We have this enormous set of corrections taking place and the question is whether or not there's an ongoing post-bubble hangover that could put the expansion on hold for a while  The unambiguously good news he said was that inflation would probably continue falling this year as we've seen an unusually large cyclical rebound in productivity that reduced the upward pressure of wages on profits and prices But he is worried that by next year we'll see an inflection point and inflation begin to rise somewhat forcing an inevitable pre-emptive move by the Fed to tighten the noose on money and credit after cutting short-term interest rates to 40-year lows last year When will the investment slump end Mr Meyer's favourite real leading indicators of investment are the government's monthly report on orders for non-defence capital goods commercial heavy equipment also a favourite of Alan Greenspan Fed chairman and a recently devised G7 investment index as well as surveys conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Association of Purchasing Management All suggest that if not sinking investment may have stabilised Mr Meyer said a critical turning point from the current mix of sluggishness and uncertainty for employment and the economy in general would be when firms turn their attention from maintaining current profitability to looking for opportunities to enhance future profitability ,3
2002-06-20, Two private-sector consortia negotiating lucrative deals to refurbish the London Underground stand to gain hundreds of millions of pounds in success fees and recovered costs when they sign the contracts Tube Lines which is in the final stages of negotiating one of three infrastructure contracts with LU is seeking £109m shortly after signing and £60m later Metronet the other consortium is understood to be seeking a similar payment for two contracts suggesting that fees and reimbursements could cost taxpayers more than £300m The size of the payments is likely to embarrass the government which says the consortia will profit from the proposed public private partnership PPP only if they deliver a better service Theresa May shadow transport secretary said the extraordinary payments were yet another incredible development in an altogether strange bidding process The payments were condemned as inexcusable by Bob Kiley head of Transport for London which will take responsibility for the Underground once the contracts are signed LU will pay Tube Lines a success fee of £36m to be passed to the consortium's parent companies led by Amey Jarvis and Bechtel £10 7m in success fees for financial and legal advisers and £54 89m for development costs  It will also pay a credit rating agency fee of £480000 and £60 77m in bank fees and loan insurance fees The balance of the £169m is accounted for by associated financing costs George Hutchinson Tube Lines communications director said the payments reflected the consortium's financial commitment to the PPP We put an enormous amount of effort into developing that plan how it will work the timetable what we'll be doing to individual stations tracks and trains he said Metronet which is led by Balfour Beatty Bombardier and W S Atkins said it would not be appropriate to comment LU said the £36m payment to Tube Lines was to cover expenses such as set-up costs intellectual property and the opportunity cost of capital It said reimbursement of development costs was normal commercial practice The PPP will give the consortia 30-year infrastructure leases with trains run by LU supervised by TfL Ken Livingstone the mayor of London is seeking a judicial review of the PPP The European Commission is also investigating whether it breaks procurement rules www ft com/transport,1
2002-06-15, The Israeli government is to cut a further Shk2bn $400m £273m {XEU}422m from an already slimmed-down budget in an attempt to head off a large deficit and convince financial markets that it has the right medicine for the ailing economy The move comes only three weeks after Ariel Sharon the prime minister pushed a Shk13bn austerity package through the Knesset despite opposition from his coalition allies in the ultra-orthodox Shas party The latest cut in the Shk248bn budget came after a meeting Mr Sharon held on Thursday night with Silvan Shalom finance minister and David Klein central bank governor who have been engaged in a public feud over economic policy Faced with rising inflation and unemployment a plunging shekel and a heavy defence bill for April's invasion of the West Bank the government is struggling to meet a deficit target of 3 9 per cent of gross domestic product in 2002 One reason for the Shalom-Klein feud was the bank governor's criticism of the original austerity package and its likely impact on the deficit Mr Sharon was said to have told the two officials to stop arguing and concentrate on stabilising the economy Mr Klein this week lifted the key interest rate by 1 5 percentage points the second rise in two weeks to try to keep the shekel from falling beyond the psychological barrier of Shk5 per dollar But with the currency struggling yesterday at 4 954 to the dollar just 0 12 per cent up on the previous day a further rate rise was widely expected The fall in the shekel accounted for half of a 0 9 per cent increase in May inflation announced yesterday It brought the outlook for annual inflation to 8 per cent according to the central statistics bureau The public wrangling over economic policy and the collapse of previous emergency plans appear to have persuaded Israeli voters that Mr Sharon is less capable of dealing with the economy than with the security situation In a poll in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper yesterday 67 per cent of respondents said he was handling the economy badly The prime minister was widely praised for facing up to Shas by dismissing its ministers during last month's budget battle The party has traditionally used its swing votes in the coalition to get extra funding for its low-income constituency Since then the Shas ministers have been brought back into government and the party's interior minister Eli Yishai warned of further trouble when he said he opposed social security cuts ,3
2002-06-15, The governor of the Bankof Japan yesterday endorsed the government's view that the Japanese economy is stabilising as the country's finance minister headed for the Group of Seven meeting in Canada First-quarter gross domestic product rose 1 4 per cent compared with the previous three months as exports posted gains and capital spending fell Masaru Hayami the central bank chief said The economic trend is in line with our view  The BoJ on Thursday upgraded its assessment of the economy for the fourth time citing the boost from exports and industrial production Mr Hayami's comments which back the government view that the economy has hit bottom came one day before the G7 finance ministers' meeting in Halifax Canada where Masajuro Shiokawa the finance minister plans to tell his counterparts that the Japanese economy is recovering But while overseas demand is helping to improve the economy domestic demand has not gathered the same momentum and many Japanese companies continue to struggle with falling prices Almost 1700 companies went bankrupt in May according to Teikoku Databank a private research group Mr Hayami dismissed suggestions the government backtrack on its plan to stop guaranteeing all bank deposits from next year The ruling coalition parties have suggested a further dilution of the guarantee the guarantee on time deposits of more than Y10m $80000 ended last April could lead to savers moving their money out of weaker banks The government stopped the guarantee on time deposits of more than Y10m last April and is due to bring other types of bank accounts in line with this rule from April 2003 But members of the ruling coalition parties have suggested that further weakening the guarantee could lead to savers moving their money out of weaker banks This was dismissed by the governor of the central bank who said the credibility of Japanese banks was at stake There aren't many countries that provide deposit guarantees in the way Japan does Banking involves both risks and profits Mr Hayami said ,2

2002-06-25, Helphire the accident management group return-ed to profitability last year after making peace with insurers The Bath-based group which provides vehicles to accident victims and helps them recover the costs of the vehicles and repair services from insurers made pre-tax profits of £191000 on sales of £32 94m in the year ended March 31 against losses of £55 45m on sales of £47 29m The turnround was such that the group is considering reinstating a dividend in 2003 Earnings per share were 1p against losses of 60 5p The main difference was the reduction in exceptional and other administrative charges from £73 1m to £12 97m following a financial restructuring and revised business model Michael J Symons chairman said We are delighted with the fundamental change-round in the group's fortunes this year Our new business plan has been fully endorsed by the levels of business which we are achieving  The new business plan saw Helphire turn itself into a claims handler for insurers with an accord struck in late 2000 after years of adversarial relations helping no-fault accident victims recover their costs from insurers In many cases insurers refused to pay what they termed Helphire's unreasonably high charges forcing the company to take them to court Over the years the backlog of cases grew to over 25000 according to Helphire with the company being owed £103m After agreeing a bulk settlement with the industry for about £65m and a £40m debt facility with HBoS Helphire has reduced its net debt to £8 8m Under the ABI protocol Helphire has agreed to give insurers a discount of 30 per cent on handling the cases in return for the insurers co-operation on cases that fit an agreed profile for no-fault accidents Second-half sales increased by 58 per cent over the first half while credit hire and credit repair volumes rose by 94 and 111 per cent respectively f The pre-tax profit figure was short of analysts' consensus estimate of about £2 2m and the shares did not budge at 142p In April Helphire won a number of test cases in court which it said strengthened its position vis-a`-vis the insurers It said that following the agreement business referrals from insurers had grown from 30 to 70 per cent of the total The company said its new year had started well with underlying growth from both established and new sources of referrals ,2

2002-06-12, The world economy is coping with the aftermath of two huge asset-price bubbles the Japanese of the 1980s and the US-led worldwide bubble of the second half of the 1990s Adjustment to the end of the first is not yet over Adjustment to the end of the second has contrary to conventional wisdom hardly begun According to that wisdom the world's largest economy is leading the rest of the world into a durable if restrained recovery after a surprisingly brief and shallow recession Yet this may turn out to be no more than a fairy story for frightened children Recent falls in the stock market and the US dollar suggest the children are unconvinced At its closing price of 1031 on Monday the S&P 500 was only 7 per cent above its post-September 11 low and 33 per cent below the peak reached in March 2000 Similarly on a trade- weighted effective basis the dollar had lost 6 per cent of its value since its peak on January 25 2002 To understand the risks ahead it is necessary to analyse where the world economy now is in its post-bubble adjustment Between 1996 and 2000 the US economy generated 40 per cent of global incremental real demand at market exchange rates While US real domestic demand rose 26 per cent over those years a compound rate of 4 7 per cent a year output grew by 22 per cent a compound rate of 4 1 per cent The difference was the rise in the US current account deficit to 4 5 per cent of gross domestic product in 2000 This expansion was unsustainable and last year came to an end Symptoms of excess were as Brian Reading of London-based Lombard Street Research argues too much investment too little saving and too big a current account deficit Behind these three phenomena was belief in the miracle of the new economy as demonstrated by asoaring stock market huge capital inflows and a surging dollar Over the past year and a half the US economy and given the global role of the US the world economy has begun its post-bubble adjustment Yet what is remarkable about this period is how modest that adjustment has been On June 7 the price/earnings ratio for the overall stock market was still close to double its long-run average Measures of underlying value suggest that the market is still more generously valued than at any period in the past hundred years apart from the peak of the recent bubble and in 1929 On a trade-weighted basis the US dollar is 35 per cent higher than in May 1995 Estimates of the real exchange rate suggest the dollar remains almost as high as in 1985 Last year business fixed investment in the US was only 3 2 per cent below its level in 2000 This year it is forecast by Goldman Sachs to be down only another 7 per cent The resilience of consumption has been astounding Supported by rising house prices and low interest rates real consumer expenditure rose 3 1 per cent last year and is forecast by Goldman Sachs to grow another 3 2 per cent this year The personal sector's financial deficit is still close to 4 per cent of GDP against a historic postwar surplus averaging just under 2 per cent of GDP The US current account has also barely adjusted Last year it was 4 1 per cent of GDP Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve has in effect restricted the post-bubble adjustment almost entirely to the corporate sector It has propped up asset prices and supported household borrowing and spending The big question today is whether it has durably averted or temporarily postponed that adjustment The answer is that however unpredictable its timing and speed it is highly implausible that adjustment can be averted for ever That would imply a continuation of extraordinarily low household saving It would also mean an explosive rise in the current account deficit If the US were to continue to grow faster than most of the rest of the world the deficit could reach 5 per cent of GDP next year Under plausible assumptions net claims by foreigners on the US would also rise from 20 per cent of GDP to 50 per cent of GDP or more five years from now This looks inconceivable A more natural outcome would be a weakening dollar weak domestic demand and an improving external balance That change could in turn be triggered by a diminished willingness of foreigners to purchase US assets The vulnerability is evident As a gigantic net borrower from the rest of the world the US depends on foreigners to sustain the value of its corporate assets and its currency As London-based Smithers & Co says domestic corporate cash flow is now weak and US households have been persistent net sellers of the stock market This is in part to finance the purchase of other assets especially houses If foreigners fail to fill the gap stock prices as well as the dollar must fall Further asset price adjustment is thus likely If it coincided with weakening household demand and if the adjustments particularly in the dollar were slow and limited it would also be helpful for the US If for example the trend rate of economic growth were to be 3{1/4} per cent a year and domestic demand were to grow at say 2{3/4} per cent there could be a steady contraction in the current account deficit at half a percentage point of GDP a year Instead of adding demand to the rest of the world the US would then be subtracting from it The question is where this would be offset The eurozone has alas generated growth in domestic demand of more than three per cent in only two years 1997 and 1998 since 1993 Growth in demand averaged only a little over 2 per cent between 1993 and 2001 Over these years Japanese growth in demand averaged 1 2 per cent With Japan's room for manoeuvre limited much would depend on the ability of the eurozone to generate faster growth in demand Without aggressive action by the European Central Bank that seems depressingly unlikely It is at least as plausible that weaker export growth and a strengthening currency would undermine investment and consumption in the eurozone One can therefore envisage three alternative scenarios for the medium term First there may be no significant further adjustment in the behaviour of the US consumer or in US asset prices In that case the US would generate strong additional demand for the rest of the world and even more un-balanced household and national balance sheets This would be a Gadarene rush for the cliff But that cliff may only be reached years from now Second there may be smooth adjustment in US household behaviour and the dollar The latter would help offset weak demand at home by forcing adjustment on the rest of the world This scenario would be most beneficial for the US but decidedly problematic for the rest of the world Third there may be brutal adjustment in the near future with a vicious downward spiral in US and world equity prices higher long-term interest rates an exodus of capital and dollar weakness This would force a strong reduction in investment and consumption in the US and an unpleasant adjustment on the rest of the world This would be the world of the double dip None of these alternatives can be ruled out But the second is preferable for both the US and the world If the dollar were now set on a gradual decline that would be altogether helpful Unfortunately this scenario is too rosy to be plausible The true choice may be between going over a high cliff some years from now or going over a rather lower cliff quite soon The consensus view is not necessarily wrong There may be a US-led recovery in the next year or two But it is too short-sighted The post-bubble adjustment can only have been postponed It would be better if adjustment continued at a moderate pace right now Monthly International Review 115 April 2002,2
2002-04-16, Shares of Iberia rose almost 7 per cent yesterday after the Spanish flag carrier reported a large reduction in operating losses for the first quarter as capacity cuts coupled with rising demand lifted its occupancy rate to 69 8 per cent the second-highest level for the first quarter in the past 12 years Shares closed at {XEU}1 78 as the group announced that operating losses for the three months to March narrowed from {XEU}90m $79m last year to {XEU}5m Earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortisation and rentals almost doubled from the year before and were 44 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1998 Sales rose by about 1 per cent while costs fell by 6 per cent While September 11 meant disaster for many carriers in the industry Iberia's management used the crisis to push through a series of unpopular job cuts and close unprofitable routes Iberia ended long-term lease agreements for aircraft and crew delayed the arrival of new aircraft and retired several older models in its fleet It also cut its winter schedule by 11 per cent one of the largest reductions among European carriers and began the process to lay off 10 per cent of its employees The plan which was provisioned for last year is expected to generate savings of {XEU}54m in 2002 and {XEU}108m in 2003 The improving conditions in the first quarter will allow Iberia to take delivery of three Airbus A320 aircraft Management has also not ruled out the possibility of renewing some of its cancelled wet-lease contracts Occupancy levels in March increased in its short-haul medium-range and long-distance flights due to better management of its flight capacity The month was essential to the improvement in the first-quarter results due partly to Easter week a heavy travel period Operating profit in March surged from {XEU}1 5m last year to {XEU}27m The airline's shares have risen by 40 per cent since January Analysts said the company's results which beat forecasts a broad recovery in airline stocks and the possibility of Iberia entering Madrid's IBEX-35 index were supporting the rise ,2
2002-06-10, It is often an advantage tobe Irish in the US But Willie Cotter chief executive of Bank of Ireland Asset Management is the first to admit the limitations of playing the ethnic card in the world's most important investment market In many ways the last thing Americans would have associated with Ireland was having their money managed there says Mr Cotter speaking at BIAM's Dublin headquarters where a staff of 25 manage a $52bn global equity portfolio half of which is for US clients BIAM originally a joint venture with two UK merchant banks Schroder Wagg and Morgan Grenfell is now the fifth largest manager of non-US equities for US institutions Last month it announced its first acquisition a $177m deal to buy 61 per cent of Iridian an independent US active investment manager Non-US or international equities make up about 15 per cent of US pension assets As with other foreign providers BIAM has had little luck tapping into the larger domestic equities market which represents almost half of all US pension fund assets I don't think it's ever been done says Mr Cotter The only way to go is through acquisition  BIAM looked at hundreds of potential takeover targets over the past five years before deciding on Iridian We're a bit choosy because this industry is known for a distinct lack of success for acquisitions working A lot of acquirers are doing it for the wrong reasons It became a very trendy thing in the 1990s particularly for European banks said Mr Cotter The Iridian deal will double BIAM's client base BIAM currently has about 250 public and corporate pension fund clients while Iridian has some 200 US clients in the foundation and endowment markets Under stock exchange rules Bank of Ireland is not required to publish profit figures for Iridian as the cost of the deal is less than 5 per cent of the bank's market capitalisation At about 3 per cent of assets under management the price paid is in line with similar deals in the industry Mr Cotter is reluctant to make predictions but he does not rule out the possibility that Iridian could soon be a bigger fund manager than BIAM It has been a long hard slog establishing a reputation in the US market We got our first customer in 1990 which was a $1m account says Mr Cotter Pension funds don't hire people quickly They will track you and watch you for years before they hire you  The Irish links were important New York's police and fire departments which have strong Irish affiliations are among BIAM's important clients But Mr Cotter points to a school teachers' retirement fund in California where many teachers were Jewish and the state of Hawaii which doesn't have too many Irish on its board Mr Cotter believes Irish fund managers were uniquely suited to break into the US market Ireland has a tradition of managed pension funds and as players in a small domestic economy Irish fund managers would have had much more international experience than their UK counterparts Mr Cotter says Irish pension funds have about half their assets invested outside Ireland We have always been international investors unlike funds in Britain which didn't really need to look beyond their shores  BIAM's toe in the water in the early 1990s coincided with a change in investment policy by US pension funds with many buying foreign equities for the first time Between 1991 and 1999 US pension funds increased their exposure to international equities from 3 per cent to 14 per cent America is a wonderful country    you can make a very fine living being a niche player says Mr Cotter By buying Iridian we are into a bigger niche  Like Iridian BIAM is an active value manager The bank pursues what it calls a model approach to investment all clients receiving the same product and the same investment advice Mr Cotter says BIAM is conservative in picking stocks favouring well established companies over fast growth performers His team of investment managers targets companies that drive return on equity and year after year add to shareholders' funds In the financial sector he says BIAM favours the UK banks because of their strong dividend yield and the fact they have been active consolidators in their home market Mr Cotter says We focus on companies that have a healthy balance sheet strong cash flow and a good dividend history Needless to say having a strong management is also essential ,1

2002-06-20, Robert Steve Miller likes a business challenge A turnround specialist who has worked at several financially troubled US companies Mr Miller faces perhaps his biggest test in an attempted rescue of Bethlehem Steel the third biggest US steelmaker Mr Miller was appointed chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem last September about the time the company became one of over 20 US steel companies in the past two years to enter bankruptcy protection Last year Bethlehem incurred a net loss including one-off charges of $1 95bn on sales of $3 3bn It has liabilities of some $6bn including $5bn for pension and healthcare costs of 75000 retired Bethlehem workers The 98-year-old Bethlehem has been one of the principal lobbyists for the government to protect the US steel industry from spiralling imports Like most other US steel companies it blames foreign competitors many of which the industry says have been helped by state subsidies for driving steel prices last year to 20-year lows plunging the sector into unprecedented financial problems In March President George W Bush showed he was listening announcing import controls of up to 30 per cent on many types of imported steel Mr Miller says the trade constraints which have been instrumental in helping a strong rise in steel prices this year are welcome He argues they are justified by the high level of imports affecting the steel industry Even though steel demand is higher with prices rebounding markedly companies such as Bethlehem need the breathing room provided by the tariffs to survive he says Mr Miller is no stranger to tough situations A financial specialist who spent 11 years at the Ford car company he later joined Chrysler helping to sort out a financial crisis for the automotive company in the 1980s He was then called to advise on the debt restructuring of Olympia & York a Canadian property company that became insolvent in the early 1990s while building London's Canary Wharf Mr Miller then became chairman in succession of three US companies that hit financial problems the Waste Management environmental services company Morrison Knudsen the engineering group and the Federal-Mogul car parts maker His strategy at Bethlehem is radical He plans to break the company into three parts conventional flat steel higher-value coated products for the vehicle industry and steel plate for industries such as building Outside steelmakers are being invited to take a controlling share in these operating units while Bethlehem remains a holding company Profits from the operating units would come to the holding company in the form of dividends Among the companies Mr Miller has been talking to are CSN the Brazilian steelmaker which is interested in the flat-steel business and Arcelor of Luxembourg a candidate for the vehicle steel unit The partners would bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in equity plus new technologies and management thinking and access to markets outside the US according to Mr Miller We think we can prove to people that it's better for a company like Bethlehem to have a share of perhaps half in plants that are successful than full ownership of plants that are not he says The fact that each of Bethlehem's operating units would become part of a bigger international entity is he says totally consistent with the global move towards consolidation Onlookers disagree whether the plan makes sense Bill Peluchiwiski a steel specialist at Houlihan Lokey Howard & Lukin an investment firm says Mr Miller's initiative increases the probabilities that Bethlehem can survive However Peter Marcus managing partner of World Steel Dynamics says The plan sounds complicated and could easily fail  Mr Miller 60 has given himself until the end of the year to conclude deals with potential partners He is cautiously optimistic that he can reach equally important deals with the steel unions over flexible working With the US economy looking as if it may turn up next year he says Bethlehem could increase production in the next few years I could see the company adding another 2m tonnes of capacity to the 8m tonnes it made last year I feel the strategy can put the company on the road to recovery ,2

2002-06-24, Malaysian politics was thrown into turmoil over the weekend when Dr Mahathir Mohamad the prime minister dramatically and unexpectedly announced his resignation on Saturday and then reversed his decision an hour later Dr Mahathir 76 made his tearful announcement at the close of his ruling party's annual meeting He then met top party leaders before leaving the country yesterday for a holiday in Europe The announcement and the subsequent pandemonium when party leaders surrounded Dr Mahathir to beg him to change his mind was carried live on national television and was followed yesterday with the news that opposition leader Fadzil Noor of the Islamic Party of Malaysia PAS had died after recent heart bypass surgery Abdul Hadi Awang PAS deputy president seen as a less moderate Islamist has assumed the role of opposition leader ahead of a formal decision by the party Analysts said Malaysia may be facing a period of more polarised politics between PAS which wants to implement Islamic law in the two states it controls and the ruling Umno-led multi-racial coalition which is attempting to peel back over three decades of affirmative action programmes for the country's Malay majority Dr Mahathir gave no reasons for his decision to resign but in his keynote address to Umno on Thursday he lamented his failure to change the Malay character which he described as lazy and impatient for wealth Despite a heart bypass operation in 1989 and serious challenges from two former deputies in his 21 years in power Dr Mahathir had been expected to lead his coalition to a sixth general election victory next year The September 11 attacks had helped him reverse a loss of support to PAS and international investors have put aside their anger at Malaysia's imposition of capital controls and corporate rescues during the Asian financial crisis International institutions eagerly snapped up shares of Malaysia's largest cellular operator Maxis just over a week ago and bankers for another big public offering of toll road operator Plus said the fundamental investment case for the company remained unchanged There is no fear of Malaysia collapsing into instability said Manu Bhaskaran of strategic consultant the Centennial Group Personalities are important in developing countries but people should remember that Malaysia has a tried and tested institutional structure that has managed several transitions and crises  Political analysts said that despite the confusion of the announcement the significance of Dr Mahathir's actions was that he had finally began a process of leadership transition This whole episode will bring about a smoother and more consensual transition than might have been expected said Abdul Razak Baginda executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Council For regional reports www ft com/asiapacific,3
2002-06-10, German retail fund assets are expected to double to more than {XEU}800bn £520bn in the next five years helped by pension reforms and a growing equity culture according to Cerulli Associates the US consultancy Cerulli's projections come in spite of a disappointing performance last year when mutual fund assets fell by 1 per cent to {XEU}296bn and cross-border fund assets sourced from Germany were flat at {XEU}115bn People weren't pulling their money out of funds they just switched to real estate and money market funds said Thomas Marsh a Cerulli consultant Once people have got used to the idea of investing they don't want to go back to bank deposits  Mr Marsh says the retail market will benefit from strong demand for international fund products and the rise in internet-based distribution networks There has never been a better time for foreign funds to enter the German retail market  German banks still dominant in fund distribution are increasingly distributing investment products of rival financial houses As big banks focus on top foreign fund managers others would be pushed towards electronic fund supermarkets he said Last year fund supermarkets accounted for 18 per cent of net new inflows into German mutual funds Germany more than any other country in continental Europe will emulate the success of fund supermarkets in the US said Mr Marsh These electronic distribution channels aimed increasingly at financial intermediaries are expected to account for {XEU}100bn or 12 per cent of mutual fund assets by 2006 according to Cerulli A strengthening of the financial intermediary sector is forcing banks to improve the quality of their investment advice The big challenge for them is how to turn tellers into advisers said Mr Marsh ,2

2002-06-14, The Financial Services Authority said yesterday that Fitch the ratings agency was plain wrong to claim that the principal City regulator regarded 200 UK insurers as being at higher risk Commenting on a report the agency published on Wednesday John Tiner managing director of the FSA said It is vital to understand that the approach we will be taking makes a clear distinction between the probability of a risk arising and the potential impact were it to materialise  While the FSA had placed 200 insurers under the category of high impact Mr Tiner said it would not be unusual for these companies to pose a low actual risk since the probability of problems arising was assessed as being low The FSA also said it had not singled out the insurance sector for special attention and was carrying out risk assessments for all the larger companies it regulated Fitch said We stand by our claim that the FSA's proposed regulatory approach is a wake-up call for the industry We do appreciate the distinction being made between 'high impact' and 'high risk' but undoubtedly some of the 200 companies that FSA has classified as high impact will also be found to be high risk  UK shares were down yesterday as weak stock markets continued to raise concerns that a further slump could hit life insurers' capital strength and their ability to write new business said Roman Cizdyn an insurance analyst at Commerzbank Meanwhile Standard Life Europe's biggest mutual life assurer said it would raise £1bn in the bond market to fund future growth and help bolster its solvency position John Hylands Standard Life's finance director said raising capital this way was cost-effective and denied it was a sign of financial weakness But he acknowledged the Edinburgh-based group's capital position had suffered because of declining equity markets According to Standard Life's latest statutory returns its free assets assets in excess of liabilities had fallen from £8 6bn at the end of fiscal 2001 to £3 4bn at the end of last year Mr Hylands said Standard Life's financial position was not in doubt since the ratings agencies Moody's and Standard & Poors had both recently reaffirmed its triple-A status Last year two of Standard Life's biggest quoted competitors also tapped the bond market with CGNU raising £1bn in August and Prudential raising £500m in November ,2
2002-06-22, Next week's two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting to decide US monetary policy is expected to be a bore since the overwhelming consensus on Wall Street is for the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged Most economists expect the Federal Reserve to hold this stance until at least the September meeting with many predicting no change until the end of the year or early next year The central bank may have begun 2002 by laying the groundwork for a tightening in monetary policy at its first meeting in January but it has become very reluctant to make the move to increase the federal funds rate from a 40-year-low of 1 75 per cent largely because of the slump in the US equity market Ethan Harris co-chief US economist at Lehman Brothers said Fed policymakers do not want to be pulled by the nose by the equity market but the sharp declines in the stock indices and the lack of evidence of a profits recovery has become troublesome to the central bank If stocks continue to fall eventually the stock market will determine the economy  Lehman Brothers like many other Wall Street firms has pushed back its expectations for a monetary tightening from September to December Lehman however is also factoring in a 25 per cent probability that the Fed will cut rates this year We continue to worry that the Fed may be forced to ease again before it begins hiking rates This change reflects three judgments the markets have always underestimated how slowly the Fed tightens in economic recoveries growing concerns about a jobless recovery worries that the crisis in confidence will damage the economy We have been inching ever closer to changing our call Harris and his co-chief economist Joseph Abate wrote in a research note last week Harris added The Fed could easily cut rates tomorrow if stocks fall 5 per cent to 10 per cent in one day  And by the way equities have been behaving in recent weeks the possibility of such a steep slide in the stock indices has increased A strong start this week to the markets turned ugly as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 3 per cent or 275 points on Wednesday and Thursday closing at 9432 53 The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 5 per cent over the sessions closing on Thursday at 1464 70 about 40 points off its September 21st low This is very disappointing after you had a Dow delight on Monday the index surged 213 points I believe we will make a new trading low by the end of the quarter said Jeffrey Saut chief investment strategist at Raymond James & Co Saut added The Fed has put itself in a box I don't think this economic pick up is going to be strong and I don't think the Fed will raise rates at all this year  For most of the economic downturn Wall Street and the Fed have cheered the strength of the consumer who has pulled the weight for corporate America amid heightening geo-political tensions fears of more terrorist attacks and a raft of accounting scandals that have sent stocks tumbling The consumer remains crucial to recovery especially with few signs of a rebound in the corporate sector Recent economic data however suggest consumer spending which makes up two-thirds of the economy could be faltering This week corporate America took notice as Morgan Stanley downgraded General Motors and Ford on Thursday The investment bank said in a report that mixed messages on the consumer suggests demand is likely to level off in the near-term GM and Ford have outperformed the S&P 500 this year by about 20 per cent each because of the surprising strength of the consumer who continued to buy automobiles in spite of the economic downturn thanks in part to low financing deals While June sales are expected to remain healthy Morgan Stanley said 2003 sales may pose some risk because of flattening demand Shares in GM and Ford fell 4 6 per cent on Thursday But the Fed may have even more to worry about in the months ahead than just the consumer The gloom in equities spilled over to the Treasury market late this week Bond prices which had been rising for weeks as uncertainty in the equity market sent investors fleeing for the safe haven of bonds lost their momentum on Thursday The fall in bonds was in reaction to the sharp widening of the US trade deficit which surged to a record $35 9bn in April as imports outstripped exports The large deficit is likely to keep pressure on the US dollar which fell to a two-year low against the euro this week and caused more headaches for Wall Street For months there had been concerns that overseas investors were pulling out of the equity market but a prolonged weakness in the dollar is likely to lead to the further erosion of overseas investment in all US financial markets mary chung@ft com,2
2002-06-25, Giulio Tremonti Italy's finance minister is feeling pretty pleased with things these days Since Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right government won power in Italy one year ago Mr Tremonti has been caught in a dilemma On the one hand he has been desperate to push through the cuts in personal and company taxation that Mr Berlusconi promised Italians in the course of last year's election campaign On the other hand he has been unable to make these tax reductions amid signs that Italy's public finances are overshooting the deficit reduction pledges made to European Union partners under the rules governing the management of the euro Last week's meeting of EU finance ministers in Madrid brought him much needed relief and has given him the opportunity to call for an overhaul of the EU's growth and stability pact While attention was concentrated on the important concessions won by the new French government regarding its deficit reduction Italy also won concessions The country is no longer required to balance its budget in 2003 but only to bring its deficit close to balance or down to 0 5 per cent GDP When we publish the DPEF Italy's annual budget projections next week we will record our initial plan for a 0 per cent deficit figure in 2003 says Mr Tremonti But next to that we will set out plans for tax reductions in 2003 which will give us the small deficit that we have now been conceded  Mr Tremonti is thinking beyond the details of next year's budget however Last week we saw a reform in Madrid that removed a small handicap for the Italian economy he says We must now look at how we can make a more substantial change for the European economy as a whole  He leaves little doubt that the target he has in mind is the growth and stability pact which sets strict limits for the size of national government deficits Here Mr Tremonti wants to make two points First economic policy-making in the EU had come to a turning point following the successful launch of the euro Balanced budgets were required in the first phase when we were in the process of setting up the euro Now we must try to move to another phase one which maintains stability but also puts the emphasis on growth and flexibility  Secondly he believes that the axis of power in economic policymaking in Europe is shifting He says the European Commission had played an important role in recent years by strongly advocating budgetary stability during the period of the euro's creation But it is now becoming increasingly clear that Ecofin the regular meeting of finance ministers from the 15 nation states is the forum where the major decisions are now being taken We are moving from technocracy to democracy It's not a move from the left to the right but from the old to the new  The Italian finance minister believes Ecofin must now look at what he calls the reinterpretation of the stability pact I think we need to look at the idea that government spending on infrastructure defence overseas aid and structural economic reform should be excluded in part or for a limited period from national budget calculations under the pact  He adds This is at the moment a hypothesis and there is no way that Italy would seek to act unilaterally on this issue    but we need to find an equilibrium between stability growth and flexibility  Mr Tremonti's decision to call for a reinterpretation of the pact suggests he is anticipating stronger calls for such a change come the autumn Last week Francis Mer his French counterpart demanded greater flexibility in the interpretation of the pact to promote industrial competitiveness That was a very powerful speech and my comments here are largely a response to that says Mr Tremonti He knows that other EU finance ministers are also keen to see stability pact reform Gordon Brown the UK chancellor has thrown his weight behind a reinterpretation of the pact but taking into account other factors such as the level of national debt Berlin may also join the reform calls if Edmund Stoiber the German centre-right leader wins Germany's general election in September But Mr Tremonti knows that the Italian government cannot be seen to call for change too forcefully Italy continues to have a debt that is 110 per cent of GDP the largest in the eurozone And officials at the Commission in Brussels continue to have doubt about the sustainability of Italy's public finances This is a debate in which Italy and Mr Tremonti in particular will always be a follower rather than a leader ,3
2002-06-05, Future plans Italy is abuzz Does Romano Prodi European Union Commission president plan to return to Rome to lead the country's beleaguered centre-left at the next general election Prodi a former Italian premier contributed to the rumour-mongering after he told Corriere della Sera the Milan daily that Europe's centre-left parties must reform themselves and that the left must learn that it can no longer be a slave to its own past Such words may seem harmless But in Italy where a furious debate is raging between the left's traditionalists and modernisers many have seen it as the opening salvo in Prodi's campaign to return to national politics Prodi's team says he will complete his mandate in Brussels which lasts until early 2005 Still his comments are the closest he has come to directly intervening in Italian domestic politics since he became Commission president in 1999 ,3
2002-06-18, The Australian woolmarket still offers Australian woolgrowers handsome returns despite prices slipping lower so far this year The stronger Australian dollar and concerns about global growth have resulted in a price fall of about 11 per cent since February when wool hit its highest levels in more than a decade The Eastern Market Indicator price an average of a variety of wool types and microns was trading in February at 989 Australian cents a kilogramme Yesterday it was trading at 878 cents/kg For Australian wool-growers though current price levels are still attractive And most analysts expect them to remain so Australia accounts for almost 75 per cent of the world's total wool exports Soaring prices have not been the only noteworthy feature of the market over the past year The composition of the Australian wool clip has also changed dramatically This year fine wool 19 5 micron and finer comprises about 25 per cent of the clip Back in 1990 fine wool comprised just 4 per cent of the clip This trend away from broad to fine wool production has been under way for almost a decade but it has accelerated dramatically over the past year For example 18 micron wool production in the 11 months to May 2002 increased by 24 per cent year-on-year while 23 micron production over the same period declined by 40 per cent Correspondingly there has been a big impact on the price differential between fine and broad wool types Fine wool prices 19 micron used especially for garments have fallen from $A15/kg about a year ago to $A10/kg now while broad wool 23 micron has risen from $A6 35/kg to $A9 25/kg now Good news for men in suits While overall tight supply conditions should underpin the wool market demand conditions are still ordinary Topmakers are struggling due to excess capacity globally Moreover raw material wool prices in US dollars have more than doubled over the past three years but retail prices have not And wool is relatively expensive compared with its competing fibres Relative to cotton wool is extremely expensive The wool to cotton price ratio reached its highest level since March 1989 last month when wool prices were six times those of cotton The average of the ratio over the past decade has been 3 2 ,2
2002-04-29, Germany's Free Democrats are on a roll After performing more strongly than expected in three regional elections in recent months the small liberal party often the kingmaker in national coalitions scents power again With opinion polls showing chancellor Gerhard Schroder's alliance of Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens falling short of a majority at September's general elections the FDP has been in the limelight Even five months away from the ballot box it is presenting itself as the junior partner to either the centre-left SPD or centre-right Christian Democrats in Germany's next government Crucial to the FDP's image has been Guido Westerwelle its young and dynamic chairman Mr Westerwelle 40 who became FDP leader last year has introduced a mixture of showmanship and substance to broaden the FDP's appeal beyond its traditional base of the professional middle classes Among the innovation has been the dogged focus on winning 18 per cent of the vote in September Although fanciful the aim underlined by 18% logos on every piece of party literature has created an aspirational target galvanising voters and sending a warning signal to the bigger parties that Mr Westerwelle wants to be taken seriously He denies accusations that his party's success in state elections in Hamburg Berlin and most spectacularly Saxony Anhalt stemmed more from disenchantment with the mainstream than the appeal of the FDP I've never said that Saxony Anhalt where the FDP gained more than 13 per cent could be extrapolated nationally But I do think it was a key election ahead of the federal polls on September 22 It was a powerful pointer to the fact that the FDP is on the way to 18 per cent  Mr Westerwelle declines to address the familiar charge that the FDP which until 1998 had shared power almost uninterruptedly since the second world war is better known for opportunism than political convictions We have the most detailed programme of all the parties he claims Central to the FDP's manifesto to be approved next month are drastic tax cuts along with much greater emphasis on education Combative and unyielding on most points Mr Westerwelle does concede the party may not have done all it could in the past to broaden its appeal A cardinal error of the FDP at the start of the 1990s was to allow its political opponents to create the impression it was a party just for the few he says While breaking that mould has been Mr Westerwelle's masterpiece he is too canny to make any commitments about which way the FDP will turn after the elections I expect the two bigger parties to come out about equal As a result of that I'm hopeful we'll be able to negotiate with both to see with which we cam implement the better education policy and the better economic policy But for all his swagger underpinned by a sharp mind and clever turn of phrase Mr Westerwelle has not assuaged doubts that the FDP remains the opportunistic group it always was but now with a much slicker act As the party chairman who even allowed himself to be incarcerated on television's Big Brother as a marketing stunt he has been accused of being glib and flippant rather than a deep thinking future statesman Asked for example to define what his party represents he replies The FDP is a party for a state of mind a party for life This attitude is reflected in all sectors of society in Germany  Oskar Niedermayer political scientist at Berlin's Free University says The party has been successful in changing its strategy and defining its independence from the main parties Its image has also improved But its still not really clear what the party stands for  Nevertheless the way the polls are pointing that might still be enough to wing Mr Westerwelle a top ministerial seat in the next cabinet For regional reports www ft com/europe,3

2002-04-19, One of the traditional ways for French governments to bring troublesome chief executives to heel used to be to send in the tax auditors For months on end the government's most dogged tax hounds would parse every line of a company's books until the chief executive realised he had to surrender or resign In some ways the same kind of thing is now happening with Jean-Marie Messier the chief executive of Vivendi Universal Mr Messier provoked a political storm at Christmas when he announced the demise of France's vaunted cultural exception the system of quotas by which France protects its film industry from Hollywood This week he sacked Pierre Lescure the head of Canal Plus the pay-TV operator that by law has to spend 9 per cent of its French channel turnover on buying French movies Yesterday the government made clear that even though Vivendi is not state-owned it has many means of disrupting Mr Messier's plans The entire French political class barring as ever the ultra-liberal Alain Madelin is apoplectic at the idea Mr Messier might actually be winning his solo war against France's cultural exception It is thrilled to have hit on such a rabble-rousing theme ahead of Sunday's lacklustre presidential vote Lionel Jospin premier called on the French broadcasting regulator to investigate whether Mr Messier was in breach of national media law and commitments he made when Vivendi bought Canal in 2000 President Jacques Chirac said he had no doubt at all the regulator could take away Canal's broadcasting rights The issue is whether Canal's new management will try to wriggle out of its film funding commitments when existing agreements expire in 2004 Mr Messier believes the obligations on Canal are unrealistic and unfair given the pressures of global competition Even Canal's old management team had enjoyed little success in negotiating with the government to alleviate the terms Things will be bloody for the incoming boss from the TF1 network French cinema is a major part of French culture It is performing particularly successfully at the moment thanks to its financing It is essential that Canal keeps to its contracts Mr Chirac said A second lever at the government's disposal is France's media ownership rules The government said it would ask France's highest administrative court to rule on whether Vivendi's rising number of US shareholders was putting it in breach It wants clarification of the 1986 law that prevents any single shareholder from owning more than 49 per cent of a national television broadcaster and limits non-EU ownership to 20 per cent Canal Plus SA the French unit of the Canal Plus group is 49 per cent owned by Vivendi Universal with the rest freely floating on the Paris bourse Every six months Canal Plus SA is required to show the regulator a breakdown of its shareholders The last count showed 5-6 per cent of Canal Plus SA to be owned by non-EU investors However it is possible that the law could henceforth be interpreted to include indirect holdings Since Vivendi Universal is itself 20 per cent owned by non-EU investors mostly in the US this could imply that some 15-16 per cent of Canal Plus could be viewed as being in non-EU ownership Although this would still be below the overall 20 per cent limit it would force Vivendi to cap its appeal to international investors A third pressure point is Vivendi Environnement The government is now insisting that Vivendi's majority-owned water utility which Mr Messier is desperate to unload to pay off the group's massive debt pile remains French This is likely to limit Mr Messier's ability to bring about a merger involving a larger foreign company such as Germany's RWE Last the government will not shy from leaning on Vivendi's board members pillars of the business establishment as they weigh up whether to back their much-weakened chairman and chief executive Peer pressure in a business culture as incestuous as France's should never be underestimated The government has many ways of making life even more unpleasant for Mr Messier www ft com/france2002,3
2002-06-15, If a large pension scheme run by professional fund managers performs well the managers will take the credit and boast of their share picking skills and general brilliance If the fund performs poorly they might blame a general stock market downturn and circumstances outside their control The managers might provide scheme members with a list each year of the scheme's major shareholdings so any bad performance by smaller investments would never be revealed I am not a member of such a scheme Instead I have a self-invested personal pension plan SIPP for which I make all the investment decisions This means that at any time I should know exactly what shares the SIPP owns and how well the scheme is performing One holding in Albert Fisher Group requires explanation I first bought shares in this food products company in October 2000 paying 5 45p per share I knew the firm was loss-making and heavily in debt but I looked upon it as a recovery gamble Terry Robinson had been appointed as Fisher's chief executive in October 1998 and had reduced Fisher's debt levels by a general restructuring of the firm and selling some of its subsidiary companies Fisher supplied food products to various stores including Asda Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer which they sold under their own names In October last year I increased my SIPP's holding in Fisher paying 5 19p per share I hoped the company's results announcement due later that month would contain some favourable news that would make the share price rise On October 25 Fisher announced its preliminary results for its financial year ended September 1 profits before tax and exceptional items had increased The company stated The business transformation process signals continuation of strong profit improvement into 2002  The company's full report published last November included the comment that the board had confidence in the future Debt levels were still high but since the firm's financial year end commercial terms had been agreed for the extension of £113m of the firm's loan facilities until February 28 2004 At the company's annual meeting on December 12 Hugh Ashton Fisher's chairman said he expected trading on a full-year basis to be in line with the consensus of analysts' expectations for the year to August 31 2002 By the end of December Fisher shares were 6 25p Usually I avoid companies with high debt levels I made an exception for Fisher because I thought it had managed to bring its debts under control Fisher's patented FreshHold technology which increases product quality and the shelf-life of prepared vegetables ought to have had licensing potential On March 28 Fisher said that profits for the firm's financial year were likely to be materially lower than current market expectations and the adverse trading performance has impacted the company's financing arrangements which are being reviewed with its lenders I should have immediately dumped my Fisher holding perhaps only getting 2p per share The receivers were called in on May 22 and the shares were suspended at 2p Shareholders are unlikely to get anything from the receivership I can try and blame my decision not to sell on family medical problems a leaking roof or writing a book but I have no excuse ,2
2002-04-29, There is a creeping sense of deja` vu in Pakistan On Tuesday General Pervez Musharraf Pakistan's self-appointed president who took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 is holding a referendum to extend his term by five years The move which has been attacked by Pakistan's political parties as unconstitutional and has worried some in Washington echoes similar plebiscites staged by Gen Musharraf's two military predecessors In both cases General Ayub Khan in 1960 and General Zia-ul-Huq in 1984 the Pakistan electorate ratified the generals' request for a further five years in office Gen Khan was ousted by popular protest in 1969 Gen Zia was assassinated when a bomb exploded in his aircraft in 1988 Is Gen Musharraf risking a similar fate It is a question that has relevance far beyond Pakistan Since September 11 the US and its allies have relied heavily on Gen Musharraf's co-operation in the west's campaign in Afghanistan and in the wider war against terrorism And by promising to eliminate Islamic terrorist groups and restore democracy to Pakistan Gen Musharraf has apparently charted a moderate course for a country that was flirting with extremism Yet few Pakistanis or foreign observers would bet their life savings on Gen Musharraf's longevity In taking steps to concentrate more power in his own office while confronting the country's heavily armed jehadi groups the general is creating powerful enemies Those concerned about stability in Islamabad point to the recent attack on a Christian church in the diplomatic quarter in which four people died They also point to the abduction and murder in February of Daniel Pearl the Wall Street Journal reporter to whose safety Gen Musharraf had publicly attested Both are thought to have been carried out by jehadi groups If Gen Musharraf is sincere about stamping out militancy in Pakistan we must expect a lot more violent incidents in the near future says Teresita Schaffer a Washington-based expert on the region Whether that threatens Gen Musharraf himself is anybody's guess But Pakistan's recent history is not reassuring  Personal safety aside Gen Musharraf faces two immediate problems First there is mounting concern about what is seen as an unsubtle attempt to aggrandise the power of the presidency at the expense of genuine democracy Under Pakistan's 1973 constitution the president is elected by the senate the national assembly and the country's four provincial assemblies Gen Musharraf has pledged to restore democracy to Pakistan in assembly elections this October In holding a referendum first he is signalling that he would not trust the newly elected assembly to ratify his next term Last week he said he would respect the October polls but would maintain unity of command in their aftermath To critics such talk smacks of military authoritarianism Gen Musharraf tells the Pakistan people 'I am a soldier I believe in the unity of command' but 140m people cannot be made to stand to attention says Husain Haqqani former adviser to two Pakistan prime ministers and visiting scholar to the Carnegie Endowment in Washington Yet it is clear that Gen Musharraf can still call on widespread support in a country that has become deeply cynical of democratic parties Prominent members of Pakistan's technocratic class including leading economists and civil servants believe that Gen Musharraf provides a far better hope of modernising Pakistan than his opponents Those who are protesting loudest against the referendum are from the country's elite which is narrow feudal and corrupt says Shahid Javed Burki former Pakistan finance minister Gen Musharraf is the man best equipped to ensure Pakistan rids itself of the jehadi groups  Domestic and international support for Gen Musharraf's sec ond pledge to eliminate Islamic militancy from the country has arguably given him some latitude to ignore constitutional niceties Yet here too there are questions about whether he can keep his promise Although the Bush administration remains publicly supportive of Gen Musharraf having fulfilled its pledge last December to reschedule a large chunk of Pakistan's external sovereign debt some in Washington are starting to question both his sincerity and his capacity to deliver what he has promised Doubters point out that Gen Musharraf has already released an estimated 1600 of the 2000 Islamic militants who were arrested after his widely praised television address on January 12 in which he vowed to eliminate Islamic terrorism from Pakistan Among those released include Hafiz Saeed head of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba group one of the most feared Islamic groups in south Asia Meanwhile Masoud Azhar leader of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammed group which India claims was responsible for a suicide attack on its parliament last December has been transferred to house arrest A lot of people are beginning to question whether this is a genuine crackdown at all says Ms Schaffer It looks more like a slap on the wrist and a promise to behave in future  For its part the Bush administration appears likely to overlook awkward questions about Gen Musharraf provided he continues to offer full support to the US-led war on terrorism In spite of Gen Musharraf's alleged prevarication in stamping out domestic jehadi groups diplomats say Islamabad continues to respond with alacrity to Washington's requests The US still needs Pakistan's assistance in tracking down Osama bin Laden head of the al-Qaeda terrorist group and Mullah Omar head of Afghanistan's ousted Taliban regime both of whom are thought to be in Pakistan or in Afghan territory close to its border In addition officials in Washington say they appreciate the political risk Gen Musharraf takes whenever he permits US military personnel to operate on Pakistan soil They also appreciate his pledge to desist from sponsoring Pakistan's traditional client groups within Afghanistan where the stability of the interim government remains precarious America has no illusions that Gen Musharraf is necessarily a model democrat or even the man who will transform Pakistan society these may or may not be the case one western diplomat says Washington's top priority is to continue the war on terrorism and the rebuilding of Afghanistan neither of which can be achieved without him  For the moment Gen Musharraf's usefulness to the US provides wide leeway to pursue his own agenda But if he is perceived to misuse that for example in sponsoring cross-border terrorism in the Indian-held portion of disputed Kashmir US patience could erode US officials say they have not forgotten the fact that more than 1m Indian and Pakistan troops remain fully mobilised along the Indo-Pakistan border following the terrorist attack on India's parliament in New Delhi last December India and Pakistan both possess nuclear weapons Nor have the more experienced US diplomats forgotten what happened to Gen Zia the last Pakistan military leader to have been championed by the west Gen Zia was widely hailed as Pakistan's answer to the war on communism when he helped Afghan freedom fighters defeat Soviet occupying forces in the 1980s But the assassinated general bequeathed a legacy of Islamic militancy in both Pakistan and Afghanistan Gen Musharraf is considered indispensable in the fight to eradicate that In the process

2002-06-14, The Japanese Ministry of Finance pamphlet entitled Let's Talk About Taxes features a picture of a smiling man in the top left hand corner of the page that explains the fiscal deficit and an equally beaming woman on the page that describes tax revenues But by the time the reader has digested the statistics and read to the bottom of the pages the facial expressions have changed to ones of near-panic I am worried about the future says the woman The man says We really have to think seriously about this  Worrying about the future and thinking seriously about tax is the ministry's job and the user-friendly style of the pamphlet and the smiling characters are its disarmingly innocuous way of communicating a deeply unpleasant reality taxes must inevitably rise It is easy to see why the smiles disappeared In 1990 tax revenues were over Y60000bn $482bn £330bn {XEU}509bn but as a result of economic stagnation and tax cuts they will drop to around Y46800bn in the financial year starting April 2002 the same level as 1987 In terms of the fiscal deficit in 1990 tax revenues of Y60000bn compared with general account expenditures of YY69300bn In 2002 tax revenues of Y46800bn will compare with expenditures of Y81200bn Filling the gap are government bond issues which have risen from Y7300bn in 1990 to peak at Y37500bn in 1999 before coming back to be capped at Y30000bn in 2002 Bonds now finance around one third of annual central government revenue and Japanese government debt as a percentage of GDP is 140 per cent Hiromitsu Ishi chairman of the tax commission who like the pamphlet's characters combines a cheery demeanour with an apocalyptic prognosis for Japan if his message is not heeded We might be bankrupt in 10 years he said He points out that the tax burden in Japan is the lowest of all the Group of Seven nations driven down by economic deterioration and a series of tax cuts begun in 1988 In Japan the tax burden to national income ratio is 22 9 per cent against 26 5 per cent in the US 40 per cent in the UK 31 per cent in Germany and 40 per cent in France This comparatively low tax burden must be seen in the context of Japan's falling birth rate and ageing population which results in a simultaneous rise in social security expenses a drop in the number of taxpayers and a fall in tax revenues Furthermore debt-service costs will rise as the national debt grows and central government disbursements to local authorities also rise A tax increase is inevitable says Mr Ishi Mr Ishi will today meet Junichiro Koizumi prime minister to present his tax plans He admits the chances of successfully conveying the urgency of a rising tax burden will be slim If prime minister Koizumi makes a strong decision and uses his will some parts of our proposals will be realised If he follows his original ideas of some pain before gain the painful side of tax reform will be implemented he said But he pointed out that the prime minister's popularity is falling and that members of the coalition government's own tax committee which thinks up ideas alongside Mr Ishi's commission appear to favour a far more palatable diet of tax cuts Rate cuts have been done in the past We need to broaden the tax base and it means a tax increase absolutely We need to be careful proceeding with such an idea although it is inevitable we will need to explain it sincerely  No matter how sincere the explanations the prime minister's ability to push for future tax rises has been hindered by his declining popularity rating which means he must now compromise more deeply with other members of the Liberal Democratic party The coalition government's tax committee dominated by the LDP indicated yesterday it favours tax cuts to stimulate consumer spending and boost the economy The party's support will be needed if any plans are to become law The problem said Mr Ishi is the LDP  Mr Ishi describes the political debates to come on the tax system in future months as a battlefield Meanwhile on the last page of the ministry's tax pamphlet the cartoon couple point out Don't forget about the burden we'll be leaving our children!,3
2002-06-07, Deloitte Consulting's board yesterday decided on a management buy-out as a way of separating from its parent Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu the New York-based professional services group Accounting firms have come under increasing pressure to separate their accounting and consulting businesses since the collapse of Enron late last year DTT said in February it would spin off Deloitte Consulting to address concerns about auditors' independence Deloitte Consulting which has been considering a variety of options over the past three months including a merger sale or IPO said the transition to an independent privately-owned firm would occur by the end of the year Its board which includes representatives from DTT is expected to vote shortly on the proposal The board's support for the move came at the annual meeting of Deloitte Consulting's 1200 partners and directors in San Francisco It had been considering the buy-out proposal for the past two weeks All partners are expected to participate in the buy-out said Ken Clinchy Deloitte Consulting's European managing director Funding for the move was still being negotiated he added DTT would continue to own a small stake of Deloitte Consulting for a limited period said David Owen managing director for Deloitte Consulting in the UK However the group is expected to progress to complete independence over time Deloitte expects the buy-out to reassure clients of its independence In recent months many clients have had to choose between the services of DTT and Deloitte Consulting Deloitte Consulting will shortly announce a new name and branding strategy It has also been discussing strategies at the annual meeting which could see it offer a different mix of services It had revenues of $3 5bn £2 4bn last year with most of its business stemming from the US Other accounting firms have also been feeling the pressure to separate their auditing and consulting businesses PwC Consulting which has been planning for some time to separate from PwC is hastening the process with an IPO scheduled for the summer The consulting arms of accounting firms Ernst & Young KPMG and Andersen have either been sold or taken public ,2
2002-06-19, Deutsche Bank Germany's biggest bank yesterday sold its remaining stake in Munich Re the world's biggest reinsurer raising more than {XEU}1 6bn $1 5bn The move follows clear signals from Deutsche Bank that it planned to speed up the sale of its industrial holdings as part of a restructuring aimed at reviving its sagging share price Bankers involved in the transaction said the bank had placed 7 6m shares or around 4 3 per cent of Munich Re in the market pricing the stock at {XEU}213-{XEU}215 a 5-6 per cent discount on yesterday's opening price The offer was covered within an hour said one banker It is now heavily oversubscribed Demand was incredible Allocation will be very tight  Deutsche opened its books at midday Frankfurt time and closed them barely four hours later Munich Re shares were down about 4 per cent in late trading at {XEU}220 20 after earlier falling to {XEU}211 30 Under plans drawn up by Josef Ackermann the new chairman Deutsche said earlier this year it would accelerate the sale of industrial assets worth up to {XEU}15bn He earmarked some of the proceeds for a share buy-back programme The move along with a cost-cutting drive and efforts to sell low-profit businesses is aimed at raising Deutsche's market value This has fallen by more than a third to {XEU}45bn over the last year limiting its strategic options for the future However analysts believe Deutsche is also under pressure to sell its shareholdings which represent about a third of its market value because of fears that capital gains tax might be reintroduced after Germany's September election The tax formerly around 50 per cent was long cited as a justification for the bank's reluctance to sell industrial stakes Deutsche also holds significant stakes in industrial gases group Linde tyremaker Continental cement producer Heidelberger Zement insurer Allianz and vehicle maker DaimlerChrysler Bank officials have repeatedly stressed that everything is up for sale at the right price In the first quarter of this year the bank booked gains of more than {XEU}1bn on sales of shares in Allianz and Munich Re following sales last year of more than {XEU}1 4bn Analysts said the timing of yesterday's placement suggested Deutsche was concerned about securing gains before the end of the second quarter The bank has been cutting back on costs but earnings are set to remain depressed given the weakness of world markets ,2

2002-04-06, It was a cruel twist that Enterprise Oil's annual report had already been printed when the company received a takeover approach from Royal Dutch/ Shell Two days after agreeing to be bought for £3 5bn the report hit the streets with an optimistic message from the chairman that bore no resemblance to reality I see a very promising future for Enterprise as an independent    Independents represent diversity and they have made and continue to make distinctive contributions in such areas as the North Sea said Sir Graham Hearne the man who had built up the business over 18 years In fact the deal marked the passing of Britain's last significant independent oil producer A series of mergers and acquisitions over the past decade has left only a handful of exploration and production companies listed in London all of them a factor of 10 smaller than Enterprise and most with the bulk of their activities overseas The transaction will be a good one for Enterprise shareholders Shell has offered a hefty 60 per cent premium to the group's share price before it received an exploratory offer from Eni of Italy in December But many in the City were overcome with a wave of nostalgia tinged with sadness as they recognised this was the end of a swashbuckling era of North Sea entrepreneurs eccentric characters and corporate excesses The curtain fell for Enterprise at half past midnight on Tuesday with a phone call to Sir Graham at his farmhouse in Tuscany from Phil Watts chairman of Shell Last-minute negotiations over redundancy conditions for Enterprise staff had been concluded and Sir Graham reluctantly agreed to inform the Stock Exchange at 7 00am My sentiments are ones of sadness but I am a realistic businessman and certainly haven't slunk away to die in a hole he says referring to speculation that he was too emotional to be at the announcement in London At the end of the day we have to have regard for shareholder value I am confident that we could have got to the level of Shell's offer under our own steam but it would have taken a lot longer  Enterprise's journey had started later than most other independent oil companies when the former state-owned British Gas spun off its North Sea oil assets in 1983 And its early days were far from easy The week it was demerged the Saudis broke with Opec and oil shares slumped In the following years it had to fight for survival fending off challenges first from Rio Tinto then Lasmo and Elf A myriad of other indepen dents had already been spawned in the oil boom of the late 1970s The government's licensing process for offshore acreage encouraged the involvement of British companies and many came in on the coat-tails of larger oil groups as partners in bidding consortia The mood at the time was one of huge optimism and a feeling that the North Sea was a licence to print money All manner of companies from food manufacturers to banks and newspapers were taking small stakes in oilfields and in many ways the independents were the dotcoms of their day One of the early participants who is still an independent oil company executive says We were somewhat profligate in the way we spent money The industry was far more gung-ho about exploration than actual development of projects and information about what was happening on drilling rigs was getting back to the City very quickly  Some early successes helped keep the momentum going Lasmo's involvement in the Ninian discovery and Monument's involvement in Liverpool Bay were company-makers Enterprise pulled off one of the largest North Sea coups of the 1980s by outmanoeuvring its rivals over an unpromising-looking bit of acreage and then striking the 500m barrel Nelson field one of the largest discovered for years But other independents were less lucky or not as well managed Most of the best pieces of acreage had already been handed to large oil groups in the early 1970s and many of the bits that were left were marginal Premier Oil was one of a number of companies that never quite pulled off a big find despite the best efforts of Roland Shaw its expansive former chairman Mr Shaw one of the founding fathers of UK oil independents who originally hailed from Boston became more and more frustrated Once when Premier's shares fell sharply he blamed it on wider market conditions declaring When the whorehouse burns down the pretty ones run out with the ugly  Analysts and shareholders began putting pressure on the independents to spread their wings beyond the North Sea in an effort to boost their growth Some such as Enterprise Lasmo and British-Borneo attempted to compete with the majors in recognised oil provinces such as the Gulf of Mexico and Venezuela The smaller companies found their niche in frontier areas where the large companies were yet to tread Tim Whittaker analyst at Lehman Brothers says many of the independents' overseas ventures were ill-thought out and badly suited to companies of their size Most independents squandered cash flow from their early North Sea successes by spending money randomly around the world Virtually none have created value for the long-term shareholder he says Enterprise was partly a victim of this Its Gulf of Mexico results were never justified by the amount of money it spent there though it announced a large oil find in the Tahiti field the day before succumbing to Shell Sir Graham launched a hostile bid for Lasmo in 1994 that could have provided both companies with the growth they needed But the pricing was wrong and the announcement bungled robbing Enterprise of the element of surprise Rudolph Agnew Lasmo chairman successfully called on shareholders to reject the extraordinarily complicated and second class offer Four years later the groups attempted a friendly merger but the personality clash between Mr Agnew and Sir Graham meant it never came to fruition A sharp fall in the price of crude oil to a 12-year-low of about $10 a barrel in early 1999 added to the pressure on independents Consolidation in the sector started to eat away at the number of companies listed until FTSE decided in April 1999 that enough was enough a separate sector for exploration and production companies was no longer justified This was really the turning point When there was an E&P sector fund managers would compare the smaller companies against each other But when they got lumped in with BP and Shell they became of peripheral interest says Al Stanton of Deutsche Bank Within three years Monument Oil & Gas British-Borneo and Lasmo all fell under the ownership of Eni of Italy Roy Franklin chairman of Brindex the once-powerful trade association for independent oil companies believes the UK may never see companies the size of Enterprise Lasmo and British-Borneo formed again He insists however that the sector is not dead A new generation of companies funded largely with private equity and debt are coming to the fore Venture Production one of these was floated successfully last month with a market capitalisation of about £180m In the medium to long term there will be sector regeneration The companies of the future will be more serious better managed use better technology than the old independents and will probably remain smaller than Enterprise and Lasmo he says One London-based banker suggests the disappearance of Enterprise and its peers should be looked at rather like the circle of life The medium-sized ones eat the small ones They get bigger and get eaten by the majors Then the majors are eaten by the super majors The super majors spin off assets that are too small for them and the whole circle starts again he says Additional reporting by Tobias Buck,1
2002-06-08, Tyco International is selling $200m of the private equity interests of its CIT financing subsidiary through Merrill Lynch The sale is seen as a bid to clear up the company's balance sheet before a sale of the division CIT is selling parts of a portfolio of buy-out and venture interests the uncertain value of which seems to have muddied the value of the company as a whole Tyco has officially denied it is divesting its private equity portfolio but people with direct knowledge of the sale including potential buyers who are trying to value CIT's partnership interests say at least part of the portfolio is for sale Tyco a Bermuda-based conglomerate wrestled with transparency issues even before the investigation into its dealings with former chief executive officer Dennis Kozlowski Earlier this year as part of an abortive break-up plan Tyco tried to sell its plastics division The unit failed to attract anything like the $3bn price its parent was asking for however and the sale was withdrawn Private equity investors say that a close look at the financial details left doubts about the division's growth prospects More recently CIT has struggled to find buyers Lehman Brothers offered Tyco $5bn but withdrew the offer when details of it became known After that Bain Capital The Blackstone Group and Christopher Flowers the well-known former Goldman Sachs banker were reported to be considering an offer Now Tyco plans to divest CIT through an initial public offering although the timing is uncertain The secondary private equity market has been expecting a wave of large deals as companies start to manage their private equity portfolios more actively It is expected that 1999's record fund-raising when venture firms raised $105 4bn and buy-out funds raised $203 7bn should feed its way into the secondary market in 2004-2005 Fund raising in 1997 was strong but far from 1999's record levels But secondary market participants also expected corporate distress to increase activity in their market this year Lucent Technologies' sale of its venture operations was one sign that distress was biting into the private equity market Lucent's pension fund was forced to sell some assets to meet additional liquidity demands arising from the company laying off thousands of employees The debt-laden company itself raised money through the sale of a venture capital operation linked to its famous Bell Laboratories research group ,1
2002-04-11, Shares in Vodafone the world's second largest cellular phone operator fell further yesterday taking its share price to 120p its lowest level for almost four years reflecting concerns that the mobile operator's growth story was weakening This week's declines of more than 11 per cent mean that Vodafone shares are now almost 70 per cent down from their peak reached at the height of the technology boom Analysts said slowing subscriber growth in Vodafone's key markets combined with little evidence of any upturn in average revenues per user was damaging sentiment Yesterday Schroder Salomon Smith Barney issued a new lower price price target on the stock of 160p based on an assumed sales growth rate of 4{1/2} per cent annually However it warned that in a scenario where there was no growth its share price target range was between 80p and 113p Earlier this year Collins Stewart the independent broker forecast a sharp decline in Vodafone shares with the most bearish price target yet of 73p It warned that because of a slowdown in subscriber growth and limited upturn in ARPU Vodafone should lose its status as a growth stock In Europe mobile phone markets are almost saturated with market penetration running at 72 per cent Elsewhere key markets are still adding subscribers but at much slower rates Earlier this week DoCoMo Vodafone's rival in Japan warned that subscriber growth was likely to be 30 per cent lower this year A sharp decline in the Japanese market would hit Vodafone badly as the mobile operator derives close to 20 per cent of its revenues from J-Phone its Japanese subsidiary The market has got deeply spooked by slowing growth at mobile operators and worries that it won't see a recovery in growth in the near future said Simon Weeden analyst at Goldman Sachs Globally subscriber growth is slowing so revenue growth has got to come from higher customer spend The problem is that prices are at best flat and voice growth is slow Data is where the real growth will come from and the market is not ready to pay for this yet  Mobile operators have been keen to stress the importance of new data services such as multi-media messaging which will allow users to send animated pictures between phones as a key driver for future growth But a lack of compatible handsets and no clear idea how much operators will charge for such services has led some analysts to become sceptical about the success of data services Wireless data seems to be getting further and further away every month said Joel Ripley analyst at JP Morgan If the battleground moves back to voice there is a risk the wireless industry could become a bit of a bloodbath  Regulators could also spoil the party In the UK the Competition Commission is looking into call termination charges the cost of calls from mobile phones to fixed lines as well as calls between rival operators The European Commission is also investigating the costs of mobile calls made overseas Many of these problems are not exclusive to Vodafone Yesterday MMO{2} the mobile phone business sold off by BT Group last year closed at 61p down 4 per cent on the day on similar concerns But there are also some issues particular to Vodafone In particular concerns are rising that Vodafone may have to announce write-downs of possibly as much as £25bn relating to goodwill taken on after its takeover of Mannesmann the German telecoms operator in 2000 For operators the most positive news on the horizon is the advent of data services which most operators claim will account for a quarter of revenues in the next three years But with no clear sign of when these services will arrive investors are finding little to be optimistic about Analysts are questioning what visibility operators have over top line growth said Christian Maher analyst at Investec Securities Without such visibility investors are gradually assuming the worst  Lex Page 20 www ft com/telecoms,2
2002-06-15, From Dr Alister McFarquhar Sir Alison Wolf's article Knowledge economy fails the test May 25 and subsequent letters raised fundamental issues on the link between economic performance and participation rates in higher education Suppose that in time economic growth follows increased numbers in higher education is the latter the cause And if economic growth falters is this to be linked to an increase in numbers in higher education Global studies that link wealth with expenditure on education are no more helpful It is more likely that wealth facilitates relatively high expenditure on education than the reverse Prof Charles Turner June 8 and Prof Wolf say the challenge is to maintain quality with expansion But how is quality to be measured Numbers beg the question and grades are subject to inflation Alister McFarquhar Downing College Cambridge,3
2002-06-25, Turkey's corporate world has been forced into long-mooted restructuring by the country's worst economic crisis since 1945 It took the pressure of a devaluation in February 2001 and a 10 per cent contraction in the economy last year to change both companies and the rules governing Turkish business life Previously Turkey had been able to get away with boom and bust cycles in which high growth was punctuated by short recessions However profligate government spending from the 1980s onwards also saddled the country with a mushrooming public sector debt and chronic double-digit inflation Lax regulation of the banking system led to serious banking weaknesses that played a big role in triggering a financial crisis in November 2000 This was followed by a devaluation of the Turkish lira three months later In the ensuing recession many small businesses simply vanished Once-proud conglomerates collapsed when the banks they owned were taken over by the state for posing a threat to the banking system The best-managed of the remaining medium-to-large groups are disposing of non-core assets and pursuing aggressive expansion outside Turkey Less fortunate companies linger on in a twilight zone Some may be saved by a recently approved framework accord for banks to restructure the debts of otherwise viable companies that have run out of cash This scheme dubbed the Istanbul Approach has been boycotted by all international banks in Turkey together with a handful of Turkish-owned institutions We decided not to participate in this agreement because contrary to our request the agreement covers 100 per cent of Turkish banks' credit risk to all Turkish corporations says Piraye Antika chief executive of HSBC the biggest international bank in Turkey This does not correspond to international banking standards in our view  An executive at another western bank in Istanbul said his institution was reluctant as a matter of principle to be bound by restructuring agreements in which banks accounting for 75 per cent of a company's loans will have the final say Ajay Chhibber director of the World Bank in Turkey acknowledges critics' concerns that some Turkish banks may abuse the system to restructure loans to sister-companies to which they have overlent But he adds that such risks are nil if there is rigorous monitoring of safeguards built into the Istan bul Approach For example he notes that a bank cannot lead or vote on any restructuring deal involving a sister company After a year of negotiations involving the World Bank the Istanbul Approach's immediate achievement has been to spur reform of Turkey's antiquated bankruptcy legislation Debtors' ability to drag out attempts to make them repay money they owe has acted as a serious brake on corporate restructuring A key risk of the process is the weakness of creditor rights in Turkey the World Bank warned in a recent summary of the Istanbul Approach which it helped to design It is vital that the government now make rapid progress in reforming the bankruptcy regime not only on its own merits but to prevent debtors from opting out of the Istanul Approach and stalling their creditors and necessary corporate restructuring  Ultimately the extent of restructuring will depend on the success of wider economic reforms to put the Turkish economy on the path to stable growth and single-digit inflation These reforms include faster privatisation of bloated state enterprises that pose unfair competition and have been used in the past by politicians to distribute jobs to their supporters Such changes which force politicians to give up state interference in the economy are tied to massive loans from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank The main thrust of the reforms is that the state must grow thin and be replaced by the private sector says Bulend Ozaydinli chief executive of Koc the country's biggest industrial conglomerate Positive results will not occur miraculously overnight but we will see the benefits in the medium or long-term  Exports and investing abroad have become two important lifelines for companies with necessary products and know-how The past six months have seen a spate of corporate announcements heralding divestments at home and acquisitions or partnerships abroad For instance Koc in May sold 50 per cent of its well-managed but unsustainably small Kocbank to Italy's Unicredito Teaming up with a big international force was key to the Turkish group's strategy of focusing on strength in selected sectors including finance with a long-term goal of becoming one of the world's 200 biggest companies This year Koc's Arcelik subsidiary acquired two west European brand names as part of its drive to expand production and sales of white goods outside Turkey Such changes have not been confined to larger companies Organik a speciality chemicals producer with sales of $70m a year is building a $15m plant in Rotterdam This will bring it closer to both its west European customers and its raw materials for which Rotterdam is a big distribution centre As businessmen and industrialists we have to be competitive To do this we have to train ourselves daily and act both quickly and globally says Aldo Kaslowski chairman of privately-held Organik This means not just increasing our exports but investing outside Turkey In the process we will give the world a different image of what Turkish companies can do ,2
2002-06-21, House of Fraser shares fell 10 per cent yesterday after it issued a trading statement that analysts regarded as disappointing A number either cut their profit forecasts or put them under review as the department store group reported lower sales growth House of Fraser blamed road works in Birmingham for the slowing sales It said that sales at Rackhams its largest store in the city had been materially affected by traffic congestion that had deterred shoppers as well as a £20m refurbishment of the store that had closed sections of it at a time In recent weeks sales in the Rackhams store had been down 12 per cent the company said and earlier hopes that it could make up for the disruption in the second half had faded David Adams finance director said this factor would take £1m off profits He said that the slower than expected sales across the chain as customers watched the Jubilee celebrations and the World Cup had resulted in more markdowns especially of women's wear which affected margins Analysts who had been forecasting pre-tax profits of about £28m-£29m compared with £22 8m reduced their forecast to about £27m-£27 5m with some going even lower The shares closed at 73p down 8p on the day The group issued the statement before its annual meeting It said that sales in the first 20 weeks of the current year were ahead by 4 per cent on a like-for-like basis but up only 2 9 per cent in total reflecting the impact of the Birmingham disruption Analysts pointed out that when the retailer issued its results in March it said that sales in the first eight weeks of the year were ahead by 6 6 per cent in total and 6 2 per cent on a like-for-like basis However the company said in the same period of last year it enjoyed strong sales gains of 8 1 per cent so that the cumulative increase over two years was 12 per cent Comment  Just when House of Fraser seemed to be throwing off its reputation of disappointing investors it does it again Yesterday's news may not be on the same scale as past problems but there were plenty of excuses in there and it all smacks of an over-optimistic management coming face to face with reality After all last September the chief executive did not think the terrorist attacks would hit trading for long The shares down from 98{1/2}p on the day of the results in March are now on a p/e of under 10 on the new profit forecasts But with tougher trading conditions looming anyway investors will be cautious of this one for a while ,2
2002-06-13, Yet again the mobile phone maker Nokia set the tone for the European markets as it shed all its gains of the previous session pushing down close to a three-and-a-half-year low The rally following Tuesday's mid-term update of its forecasts proved to be a short-lived affair The shares ended down 7 5 per cent at {XEU}13 05 as investors reassessed the contents of its statement and also reacted to poor markets overnight in the US The update prompted a flurry of analyst recommendation changes in both directions suggesting the shares are coming close to some sort of trough Angela Dean telecoms analyst at Morgan Stanley cut the 12-month target for Nokia from {XEU}15 to {XEU}12 saying We feel there are still risks of further negative newsflow for the sector and are not confident that we have reached the end of operator capex cuts and delays  Schroder Salomon Smith Barney cut its target from {XEU}23 to {XEU}18 and Lehman Brothers trimmed its earnings per share estimate But two banks decided the shares had fallen far enough HSBC changed its stance from reduce to add with a target of {XEU}14 and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein which has been a bear of the stock since January last year upgraded from sell to buy with a {XEU}17 target The next opportunity when Nokia has to present its case is its briefing of analysts next Thursday Some are reserving judgment until they get

down to the level of mid-1996 Ericsson said it was selling its chip unit to Infineon for {XEU}400m worth of stock There was disappointment at the deal because Ericsson has negative cash flow and could have done with receiving cash Brokers said the shares were also suffering from concerns that it may have problems pulling off its {XEU}3bn rights issue announced in April Infineon fell 5 4 per cent to {XEU}15 75 its lowest since October amid general weakness in IT stocks Chipmaker STMicroelectronics was down 4 3 per cent to {XEU}24 12 and the Dutch maker of chip equipment ASML fell 9 5 per cent to

financials MLP the German financial services provider slumped to a three-and-a-half-year low on news that Borse Online the equity research newspaper had more revelations on the company in today's edition The shares down 17 per cent yesterday to {XEU}32 60 have been on a precipitous slide since the newspaper reported in May that MLP had inflated its earnings using reinsurers to finance the initial costs of life insurance policies MLP has consistently denied the reports The main problem is that there is no contact between the newspaper and MLP said one analyst who described yesterday's fall in the share price as wildly overdone They are not talking to one another The newspaper picks up items from the accounts that are difficult to understand But it doesn't go to MLP to ask for an explanation  European drug stocks have been looking distinctly queasy of late with concerns about key medicines and generic competition sending the sector down to a 26-month low The pharmaceuticals sector has traditionally been seen as a safe haven in troubled times But a string of profit warnings reflecting patent threats weak R&D productivity and mounting pressure on prices have left leading companies looking like suitable cases for treatment Drugs sink Yesterday the FTSE Eurotop 300 pharmaceuticals sub-sector sank more than 3 per cent to its lowest level since mid-March 2000 That represented a fall of 16 per cent since the start of the year Europe's big three pharma companies GlaxoSmithKline AstraZeneca and Novartis were all sharply lower matching heavy losses on Wall Street overnight Novartis dropped 4 6 per cent to SFr60 85 as the Swiss group denied market talk that its important COX 189 pain relief drug might have hit problems after a setback for a rival product It said there was no change in plans to introduce Prexige COX 189 globally as announced by the end of 2002 Swiss peer Roche dropped 5 4 per cent to SFr114 50 France's Sanofi-Synthelabo was another heavy loser with a fall of 4 6 per cent at {XEU}55 50 Although Sanofi boasts Europe's fastest pharmaceutical growth rate its premium rating has left it high and dry in the current environment particularly

2002-06-17, A lacklustre performance of the London stock market helped depress investor confidence in the UK in May according to a survey by JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management to be published today The firm's investor confidence index dropped from 82 points in April to 73 last month as investors took a more bearish view Peter Brewster head of marketing research at JP Morgan Fleming said the recent drop in the FTSE 100 index below the psychologically important 5000 point level would be a further dampener on sentiment There is still a lot of uncertainty over the recovery of corporate profits despite the improvement in the global economic backdrop he said The index based on a survey of 500 UK private investors found that 35 per cent expected a rise in the stock market over the next six months down from 41 per cent in April Twenty-five per cent expected the market to fall in the next six months up from 23 per cent in April But only a minority predicted the bear market would last for three years in a row which last happened in the 1940s he said Investors who believed that markets would be higher by the end of the year expected an average rise of 6-7 per cent ,2
2002-06-22, The oldest principle of finance is that risk is linked to reward Equities are riskier than bonds since bondholders have first claim on a company's assets and profits so equities should earn a higher return The size of the gap between equity and bond returns known as the equity risk premium is one of the most hotly debated topics in finance The debate is complicated by the fact that we can only guess what investors expect the future risk premium to be What we can measure is what the gap between equity and bond returns has been in the past Over the last two years equities have underperformed bonds in other words equity investors have not been compensated for higher risk Over the very long term however equity investors have earned a substantial premium over bonds academics Elroy Dimson Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton estimate that over the 20th century the excess annualised return was 4 4 per cent in the UK and 5 per cent in the US This excess may be a rather poor guide to the future Survivorship bias probably boosts the figures we are looking at the US and the UK not Russia or Austria-Hungary Furthermore we know that global capitalism survived two world wars the great depression and communism investors did not know it could meet those challenges at the time The chances are therefore that their expected risk premium was lower than the one they achieved But that still leaves us to answer two questions Looking forward what kind of premium for holding equities should investors expect to receive And does the current level of share prices adequately reflect the risks involved It seems reasonable to assume that in future the risk premium will be lower During the 20th century the equity market benefited from some positive surprises in terms of the eventual triumph of global capitalism the bond market in contrast suffered from unexpected inflation It is early days in the 21st century but for the moment inflation seems under control it seems likely that asset prices have built in such an assumption Furthermore in the past four years bond and equity returns have not been well correlated bonds have benefited from safe haven buying during periods of crisis such as the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management or the September 11 attacks That would suggest bonds have great diversification value and should be rated higher relative to equities than before But how much higher We could go back to another era where inflation was absent the 19th century when according to Schroder Salomon Smith Barney the equity risk premium was just 0 5 per cent However the 19th century was very volatile economically with regular recessions and financial crashes Financial regulation was also poor So it seems safe to say that during that era investors received less of a premium for owning equities than they expected The likely future premium is probably somewhere between the 19th century's 0 5 per cent and the 20th century's 4 to 5 per cent That is a pretty broad range And it does not help that there are almost as many estimates of the current risk premium as there are analysts An elegantly simple solution to the problem is offered by Eric Lonergan the global strategist at Cazenove Mr Lonergan estimates his equity risk premium by fine-tuning standard financial theory which states that the expected real return on equities is equal to the current dividend yield plus the real growth rate of dividends On the assumption that the rate of return on retained earnings equals the return required by investors Mr Lonergan demonstrates by dint of a little algebra that the earnings yield equals the required real equity market return This makes intuitive sense The earnings yield is the inverse of the price-earnings ratio So as the p/e of the market rises the expected return falls and vice versa Such a pattern has been borne out by history the low p/es of the 1970s were followed by high returns the high p/es of the late 1990s have been followed by low ones Andrew Smithers and Stephen Wright have made a similar point in their work on the market most notably in their book Valuing Wall Street The long-term real return on equities has been about 7 per cent the long-term average price-earnings ratio has been about 14 to 15 which translates into an earnings yield of 7 per cent But even if we accept this assumption it still has to be decided what the earnings yield of the market actually is The price-earnings ratio of the US market can be estimated as anything from the low 20s into the 40s depending on which definition of earnings is used Mr Lonergan uses a figure for cyclically adjusted earnings to get a more balanced view on this basis the S&P500 index is on a price-earnings ratio of 23 or an earnings yield of 4 3 per cent Deducting the real after inflation yield on bonds means that the equity risk premium in the US comes out at a little more than 1 per cent That argues Mr Lonergan makes the US market look expensive Investors are not being sufficiently rewarded for the excess risk involved in holding equities Pan-European markets by contrast are offering a premium of 2 4 per cent which Mr Lonergan thinks is reasonable while the UK market has a premium of more than 3 per cent making it cheap by international standards But can the UK market make progress if Wall Street is falling The historical record is not encouraging philip coggan@ft com,2
2002-06-21, C$8 2bn aid for Canadian farms Canada yesterday unveiled a C$8 2bn £3 6bn package of support for its farmers and urged the US to reduce financial assistance for the sector The federal government will spend C$5 2bn on agricultural aid in the next six years with the rest expected to come from the provinces The government has been pressed by farmers for aid in the face of low commodity prices and rising agricultural subsidies in the US The US Farm Bill envisages agricultural support of almost US$190bn over the next decade The move also comes at a time of rising trade tensions with the US not least over US curbs on imports of Canadian softwood lumber Ken Warn Toronto,1
2002-04-18, Political advertising in the US has proved an incomparably effective tool in shaping public opinion Front-running candidates have been humbled by the blunt repetitive blows of the selectively edited 30-second attack advert Legislative initiatives have been sunk by the relentless bombardment of stories that cast the complexities of public policy in the simplistic monochrome of good versus evil But I cannot think of a more wonderfully obscure more weird or less persuasive advertisement than the one currently being run by an organisation calling itself the Republican Leadership Council In it an angry-looking woman of a certain age waves a professor's pointer at a blackboard covered in the hieroglyphics of economic analysis The voice is breathless and the tone is reproachful An economic recovery is not going to continue at a healthy rate with the Fed stepping on the brakes on the money supply it says to an audience presumably still digesting the previous slots and wondering whether their most pressing need is for Viagra or for laxatives Interest rates get a lot of attention but nobody notices the money supply You can't get a robust economy with a tight money supply Get off the brakes Mr Greenspan  It is possible I suppose that John Doe in Peoria is going to watch the commercial slap his forehead in horror and exclaim Darn right It's high time the FOMC abandoned its outdated attachment to the Philips Curve and started doing something about the sluggish pace of MZM growth Why Virginia I'm going to write to my congressman right away and get him to give that useless Greenspan guy a grilling at the next Humphrey Hawkins hearing  But the real curiosity in this wonderfully batty piece of broadcasting is the thought that someone anyone even a small sect of the Republican party that still regards monetarism as a kind of religious obligation thinks it worth spending thousands of dollars publicly berating Alan Greenspan the Federal Reserve chairman Two years ago such an investment would have been about as wise as an order to short stock in Yahoo as the world's most powerful central banker levitated above the political fray the US economy basking in a prosperity warmed by the golden rays of his monetary policy management Now Mr Greenspan finds himself under attack on many sides Democrats are unhappy about what they see as his wanton abandonment of the fiscal hairshirt he wore for years when last year he threw his heavyweight support behind a large tax cut A sizeable section of economic opinion-formers argues he carries much of the blame for the inflation and collapse of the technology bubble with his strong endorsement of much new economy thinking And then of course there is the Republican Leadership Council muttering about the quantity theory and the velocity of circulation These catcalls are forming part of the background noise to the decision that probably needs to be made soon on whether Mr Greenspan should seek and be offered a fifth term His current term does not expire until June 2004 but because that will be in the middle of a presidential election campaign it seems more likely the decision will be made sooner That points to next year at the latest The Fed chairman has been right and his critics wrong on just about every significant issue of monetary policy in the past decade On three crucial occasions the tightening phase of 1994-95 the decision not to tighten from March 1997 until the summer of 1999 and most spectacularly the easing of policy throughout last year Mr Greenspan has demonstrated a skill that it will be almost impossible to replicate in even the best qualified of potential successors Most critics now grudgingly accept that the surprisingly aggressive tightening in 1994-95 saved the expansion of the 1990s from being suffocated by inflation in its infancy And most would give him credit for the extraordinarily agile way in which he and his colleagues responded to the economic slowdown that began in late 2000 While other central banks dawdled over their responses to their own bouts of economic weakness the Fed spent 2001 pumping liquidity back into the US economy and hence the world The only issue of genuine controversy concerns the critical period between 1997 and 2000 Critics differ on whether policy should have been tighter to stifle an overheating economy in the late 1990s or whether the Fed was overly aggressive in raising interest rates in 1999-2000 But the problem with the argument of those who say that the Fed erred in allowing the greatest explosion of stock prices in history is that they have to explain why if it was such a costly mistake it has had such minimal consequences The effect of Mr Greenspan's so-called fatal error the price that had to be paid for the excesses of the worst episode of equity market mania the penalty of repeating the terrible mistakes of America in the late 1920s and Japan in the late 1980s was er the shortest shallowest recession in postwar US history Events in other words have suggested the Fed chairman got it right when he hailed the productivity gains of the late 1990s as a real economic change that while it did not justify the absurd valuations to which equities rose at the time certainly required a much more friendly line from monetary policy than had been followed before Of course the Greenspan years have not been perfect and of course a large debt is owed to his predecessor whose success in facing down even tougher challenges paved the way for what followed But as the US and the world contemplate an uncertain future is there anyone you would rather have at the helm gerard baker@ft com,3

2002-06-21, The euro reached a two-year high against the dollar yesterday after US figures showed the trade deficit had widened by more than expected The data prompted fears the dollar could fall further if investors continued to shy away from US assets The deficit rose to a record $35 9bn in April up from a revised $32 5bn in March and exceeding analysts forecasts of a rise to about $33bn The deficit totalled $112 5bn in the first quarter compared with $95 1bn in the last three months of 2001 The euro rose to a high of $0 9646 against the dollar after the data were released The news also helped sterling to a fresh 17-month high against the dollar at $1 4996 and the Swiss franc to a new 31-month high at SFr1 5225 People are looking for any excuse to dump dollars and the numbers gave them just that said Paul Bednarczyk currencies strategist at 4Cast economic consultancy The extent of negative feeling was clear when a sharp improvement in the Philadelphia Fed's business survey later in the day failed to lift the dollar significantly Analysts said also the current state of US stock markets boded ill for the deficit in the second quarter Our data show the deficit is almost entirely funded by flows into US portfolio assets and the US reliance on this sort of funding suggests vulnerability going forward said Michael Metcalfe currencies strategist at State Street Bank In times of growing investor unease as now countries with surpluses traditionally show currency strength as investors avoid assets in countries where a deficit poses a risk to the value of those assets That has proved true of Japan where the yen hit a two-week high on dollar weakness and as data showed its own trade surplus rose eight-fold per cent on the year in May as exports picked up further The surplus reached Y619 2bn $5bn The two reports showed some stark contrasts US consumer demand is still supporting imports but in Japan imports are falling at an annual rate of 5 6 per cent But the importance of safety to currently risk-averse investors is clear Portfolio flows into Japan have increased according to the latest weekly data while the US deficit looms large over dollar assets  Uruguay announced yesterday it was floating its peso blaming currency turmoil in neighbouring Brazil and Argentina for the decision The move added to fears that the fallout from Argentina's crisis is spreading and came as the US dollar fell to a two-year low against the euro on concern over the value of US assets Brazil's real has fallen more than 17 per cent since April and Argentina's peso is down about 70 per cent since February when the government released it from its peg to the dollar The depreciations have left Uruguay unable to maintain export competitiveness under its previous system of controlled devaluations Some 40 per cent of Uruguayan exports go to Argentina and Brazil The central bank said it would only mount limited interventions to prop up the peso under the new system Previously the currency had traded in a controlled band with frequent intervention although the bank had already widened the trading band and increased its monthly depreciation rate to cope with the strains The move comes shortly after the International Monetary Fund agreed to step up its aid to Uruguay following a run on deposits similar to those seen in its two bigger neighbours The IMF often encourages countries to adopt free-floating currency systems and anlysts suggested the fund could have done so in this case This float is the result of of domestic factors and a general aversion to investing in Latin America said Mitul Kotecha global head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole Indosuez Latin America needs huge amounts of investment but it won't happen in an environment where risk aversion is on the rise  Uruguay's peso fell about 12 per cent to 20 to the dollar The Argentine peso edged down to 3 65 against the US currency while the real was at R$2 76 near recent eight-month lows ,3
2002-04-22, Tony Blair yesterday refused to rule out further tax rises before the next election while saying the increases in last week's Budget were enough to cover the extra health spending In a television interview the prime minister staked his personal future on the government's health reforms and promised voters that the extra spending on the National Health Service was fully funded by the penny increase in national insurance As Labour stepped up its charm offensive to counter accusations it had returned to traditional tax-and-spend policies Mr Blair said he would stay on as long as it took to achieve the aims the government had set itself raising the possibility he might seek a third term as leader Downing Street insiders encouraged the view that additional increases in direct taxation were unlikely However asked repeatedly on BBC's Breakfast with Frost to reassure people the government would not use the NI loophole again Mr Blair said As I say I can't write the Budget I mean I'm just going to say what I've always said on these things I can't go and write the Budget  The prime minister added What I can say is the changes we made in the health service are funded by what we did on Wednesday  Mr Blair likened the plans to reform public services to the painful restructuring of Britain's industrial base under Margaret Thatcher saying it required very difficult choices He defended the tax rises I think you will find that the vast bulk of so-called middle England support investment in our national health service because it's the best security an insurance policy they can have against illness  Asked whether he would stay until the government gets it right Mr Blair said he still had the same zeal for office as five years ago You obviously set yourself certain objectives and the government set itself certain objectives and we want to fulfil them of course we do  The plans for increased health spending which run well into the next parliament were a huge personal commitment he said Mr Blair threw down the gauntlet to unions that oppose greater private sector involvement It is a huge enterprise There is no point being in politics unless you take the big challenges on If it fails of course I will carry the can I have said that  He played down the prospect of more state funding for political parties Voters were unlikely to support it and there was no political consensus for it he said The prime minister insisted no decisions had been taken on whether to attack Iraq The Treasury strongly denied the chancellor had called Mr Blair gung-ho Opposition parties seized on the prime minister's wavering over tax Michael Howard shadow chancellor said Tony Blair's refusal to rule out tax rises reinforces the message from last week's Budget this is the end of New Labour It has returned to tax-and-spend with a vengeance  Charles Kennedy Liberal Democrat leader said the government had done the right thing but in the wrong way The prime minister should have come clean at the election ,3

2002-06-11, ImClone Systems the embattled biotechnology company facing angry shareholders ahead of a congressional hearing later this week has banned the media from its annual meeting due to be held this morning at Somerville New Jersey ImClone's shares have fallen by more than 80 per cent since the Food and Drug Administration's FDA decision in December not to review ImClone's experimental cancer drug Erbitux The shares dropped 9 1 per cent yesterday to close at $7 68 The company said yesterday that its decision to ban the press from its annual meeting was necessary to enable its chief executive to answer questions from shareholders without distractions Harlan Waksal took over as ImClone chief executive from his brother Samuel three weeks ago Allowing the media to participate in the meeting would create an unnecessary distraction from the purpose of the meeting which was to enable a candid discussion between shareholders and directors the company said ImClone which is based in New York is within its rights to exclude the media Nevertheless some investors suggested it sent a signal that the company had something to hide The biotechnology company is the focus of investigations by securities regulators and a congressional committee over possible fraud and insider trading Shareholders are expected to question Harlan Waksal who was earlier ImClone's chief operating officer about the circumstances surrounding the FDA decision On Thursday both brothers are expected to appear before the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee ,2
2002-06-22, From Mr David Lewis Sir The cost of housing is causing justifiable concern It encourages borrowing against equity and it causes particular problems of affordability for a large section of the population One firm proposal to put a brake on ever-rising prices would be to eliminate the subsidy that underlies them namely freedom from capital gains tax on the appreciation in value The introduction of CGT on owner-occupied residential property would dramatically reduce the propensity to speculate on ever-increasing prices Such speculation reduces supply and artificially increases demand In order to avoid any retrospective taxation such a change should be based on gains above current values In addition to ensure that this would not merely be a general increase in overall taxation the rate of CGT at present 40 per cent subject to taper relief should be reduced proportionally so that based on the expected future windfall from taxing gains on houses the overall estimated receipt from CGT should remain unchanged This would be an equitable proposal to create a level playing field between homes and other financial assets that over time would eliminate the distortion in value through artificial subsidy and reduce the relative overall level of house prices which would be of undoubted benefit to the economy as a whole David Lewis London W1U 6HJ,3
2002-04-16, The yen moved sharply lower against the dollar yesterday after Standard & Poor's cut Japan's credit rating Citing the slow pace of structural reform in the Japanese economy the rating agency lowered Japan's local and foreign currency sovereign ratings to AA- placing it on a par with Malta the Czech Republic and Cyprus Takahira Ogawa head of the Asian sovereign ratings team at Standard & Poor's said We had hoped that the Junichiro Koizumi administration wold press for private-sector and governmental reform but given their falling popularity and the problems that have beset key ministers and aides Standard & Poor's has lowered its expectations in three key areas  The leading credit rating agencies had recently warned that Japan might be downgraded but the timing came as a surprise to the market The dollar surged from Y131 5 to Y132 2 By the middle of New York trading it was back about Y131 85  In spite of the knee-jerk reaction of the yen the longer-term impact of Japan's latest downgrade is likely to be modest None of Japan's previous rating cuts has had any noticeable impact on the yen This is partly because the ratings agency makes decisions on the basis of information already available to the market The mandates of some fund managers do prohibit them from investing in bonds below a certain rating level But the Japanese ratings have yet to reach the level where this is likely to be important analysts said There is also thought to be a large amount of domestic money waiting to move into the Japanese bond market Until the start of this month the Japanese government guaranteed 100 per cent of investor money placed in time deposits But it has now limited the guarantee to only the first Y100m This change is expected to increase the appeal of bonds for domestic investors The impact of the downgrade on the yen should also be muted by the ownership structure of Japanese bonds said Marc Chandler chief currency strategist at HSBC in New York Foreigners own about one-eighth of Japanese bonds much less than the US bond market which is one-third owned by overseas investors he said  With the exception of a few newcomers foreign exchange strategists have recently been struggling to contain their boredom For most of this year euro-dollar has been moving in a tiny range Last week one-month implied euro-dollar volatilities fell to their lowest level since the birth of the euro in January 1999 After the surge in the dollar at the end of last year against the yen the currency has been spending most of its time in a range between Y131 and Y134 One currency trader yesterday confessed it had been the dullest year he could remember in the market As volatility falls speculators increasingly start to look elsewhere for returns Companies also start to wonder whether they need to spend so much money hedging against non-existent currency moves The fact that other markets seem to be as volatile as ever is adding to the frustration Over the past few weeks the interest rate futures markets have been particularly active as optimism over the strength of the US recovery has faded This has had almost no impact on foreign exchange So far there are two theories But both have their problems The first suggestion is that there is a deadlock between bulls and bears However this is not backed up by market positioning data There is no sign of a wide spread of positions said Paul Meggyesi senior economist at Deutsche Bank Instead everyone seems to have been gravitating back to neutral  The second main idea is that globalisation is reducing volatility Because currencies move in response to relative growth rather than absolute growth levels increasing links between economies may have been reducing gyrations in the market Unless volatility picks up analysts are likely to have plenty of time to examine these competing theories ,2

2002-06-25, Pacific Century Cyberworks Hong Kong's dominant telecommunications company has appointed Alex Arena as executive director group chief financial officer replacing Frederick Ma Ma was hired by PCCW last year but took up the financial post only at the end of last month He is leaving to join the Hong Kong government in the new cabinet position of secretary for financial services and the Treasury A former official with telecoms authorities in Australia and Hong Kong Arena joined the Pacific Century Group controlled by Richard Li the son of Hong Kong's richest tycoon Li Ka-shing in 1998 He was a leading figure in the internet group's US$28bn takeover of Cable & Wireless HKT Hong Kong's former telecoms monopoly in August 2000 Arena has since led efforts to refinance the US$12bn in debt used to pay for the takeover PCCW said Ma replaced David Prince formerly with Cable & Wireless HKT as chief financial officer Prince returned to the UK where he rejoined Cable & Wireless In many respects the fact that Fred has barely had a chance to serve as CFO means that Alex is very much the successor to David Prince in this important job said Li Ma said he would sell an estimated 7 75m shares in PCCW given to him by Li when he joined the company PCCW's share price closed at HK$1 87 per share down 0 53 per cent Joe Leahy,1
2002-06-24, Jason Yee is an odd man out at Janus the US mutual fund group That's because he runs a global value fund Janus and value sit uneasily together at least in the public mind Janus's reputation was made during the technology boom when its growth philosophy was in vogue But Mr Yee does not see it this way He says growth and value are not as investment strategies poles apart If the companies I invest in were not creating any value which is at the end of the day growth then they wouldn't be in my portfolio  Yet there are some critics who think Mr Yee's fund is Janus' belated attempt to stay afloat in the rough seas of the bear market The investment house has had a tough two years seeing funds under management tumble and as of two weeks ago its co-founder and chief executive Tom Bailey resign By contrast Mr Yee's fund launched in June 2001 has built a terrific record It has since inception seen a 17 7 per cent return against -9 7 per cent for the MSCI World Index Its assets have grown from $30m £20 5m to $250m Mr Yee says the critics are wrong The fund may have been launched a full year after the stock market crash but preparations for the fund were begun in 1999 when the technology bubble was still growing No one knew the end was coming he says At that time Mr Yee was running his own investment boutique in Denver He sold his business and moved across to Janus where though he was a value manager he was welcomed back as a fellow bottom-up stock picker he had originally trained at Janus after leaving Stanford University Growth or value Janus' fund managers do their own research visiting companies and never relying on the views of broker analysts It was Tom Bailey's cynicism of Wall Street that prompted his decision to set up Janus far away in Denver Colorado Mr Yee says that when he was learning the tricks of the trade at Janus in the early 1990s there was an unwritten rule that you were not supposed to talk to people from the sell-side This rule has forced Janus' fund managers to be self-sufficient I'm very hands-on he says My style's direct contact and phone calls When you're accountable it's very difficult to outsource that  But how can that approach be sustained for a global fund Mr Yee says his universe is huge I can pick any stocks anywhere in the world any size and any industry he explains Moreover there are no short cuts I'm on the road more than 50 per cent of my time he says In the course of a busy day he can visit five companies His saving grace is that the global portfolio is very concentrated with just 40 to 50 stocks and the companies have to meet certain selection criteria He looks for stable consistent and predictable businesses with strong balance sheets free cash flow and high returns on capital I'm looking for companies where I don't have to ask 'is this going to be around in 3-5 years' time'  Once he has found them he buys those that are in his estimate trading at just 60 per cent of their intrinsic value He knows there are some great companies that do not appear in his portfolio I'm human I go to sleep and so since the markets are always open somewhere in the world I know I'm missing something he says But he says success rests on having 10-12 good ideas in the portfolio It's never a shortage of ideas that hurts you he says It's mistakes overestimating the competence of management or the competitiveness of a product  He has an eclectic mix of companies Although he runs a global fund most of his companies 43 4 per cent happen to be in the US This he says is attributable to the extraordinary buying opportunity that followed the stock market falls after September 11 In his top 10 he holds Berkshire Hathaway the company of Warren Buffett the value manager par excellence  If this underscores Mr Yee's value credentials he holds the company for a different reason as a proxy for the insurance industry Mr Yee also likes Philips Electronics the Dutch group This he thinks is worth more than the current sum of its parts having priced each of its component businesses He sells his stake in companies when they hit his target price when managers fail to deliver the goods or when a better idea comes along But he is not about to sell his stake in Janus It may be going through a tough period but he insists there is a resolution to put things right I vote with my feet he says and I'm still here ,2

2002-06-24, The European Commission is to announce radical proposals to harmonise rules in the {XEU}370bn-a-year £238bn market for personal loans in a bid to protect consumers and foster cross-border competition among lenders According to a draft of the proposals seen by the Financial Times consumers will benefit from a Europe-wide right to withdraw within a fortnight of signing a loan contract The new rules to be published next month will also oblige lenders to consult national databases that blacklist individuals who have defaulted in the past before agreeing to the loan The Commission hopes that uniform rules and protection across the European Union's 15 member states will promote cross-border lending a key requirement to build a single market in retail financial services At present most consumers obtain loans from domestic providers as price comparisons and legal requirements outside their home country are often mind-boggling Some aspects of the new proposals which need approval from the European parliament and EU governments have been attacked by a coalition of European lenders In a letter to the Commission seven lenders' organisations warned that the new proposals could damage the {XEU}3900bn market for mortgages a type of loan where consumers do not shop across borders Although the bulk of the proposals do not apply to mortgages the Commission's plans would affect the information consumers receive on the total cost of the mortgage In several EU countries including Germany and the UK mortgage lenders calculate an Annual Percentage Rate of Change APRC -a snapshot of the cost of the mortgage that enables borrowers to compare different offers Under the Commission's proposals the APRC should include the total cost of credit to the consumer In the case of mortgages this could include taxes insurances and other costs linked to the purchase of the house According to the lenders' organisations this could create confusion as the type of costs included in a mortgage differs across the EU As a result the Commission's plans would make it even more difficult for consumers to compare mortgages across borders The industry is concerned that this extension would lead to serious competitive distortions for mortgage loans within the internal market the letter says The lenders propose a narrow APRC comprising only net interest administrative costs and lender's fees accompanied by an information sheet with all the other costs ,3

2002-06-22, Germany's benchmark index the Dax is facing the biggest upheaval of its existence on Monday From then it will be calculated not according to the full market capitalisation of companies but by the proportion of shares available to investors the so-called free float The difference can be a factor of three or more The companies that already had 100 per cent free float such as Deutsche Bank and Adidas will in theory benefit most In practice it is necessary to take into account size of companies too Electronics group Siemens with 93 per cent free float will be the biggest winner Its weighting in the Dax 30 goes up from 8 8 per cent to 11 5 per cent overtaking insurer Allianz as biggest constituent Deutsche Bank will be the second biggest beneficiary and second biggest constituent The biggest losers are BMW and Deutsche Telekom BMW gets hit hard because of another rule change also being introduced It has two categories of shares and only one of them the ordinary shares will be included in future Deutsche Telekom is punished because 43 per cent of the stock is still government owned While the change would have had a bigger impact two years ago when Deutsche Telekom's market cap was almost 10 times as big it still pushes it down from fourth to joint sixth The changes apply not just to the Dax 30 but also its extended version the Dax 100 Index tracking as an investing strategy accounts for 25 per cent of investment in Europe making it a force to be reckoned with Some of this is passive tracking but a larger amount is closet trackers institutional funds which keep a close eye on how their portfolio is performing in relation to a benchmark index On the other hand the Dax is no longer the index of choice for Europe's big money investors Following the introduction of the euro they have moved on to pan-European products such as the Stoxx 50 The Dax matters more to the domestic private investor in the same way the FTSE 100 is followed closely in the UK Nizam Hamid of Deutsche Bank says Although it is a significant change with high levels of index turnover the rebalance in terms of market impact should be relatively muted There are a relatively small number of funds that track the Dax and clearly some retail funds but overall broad institutional money has moved on from such a narrow local index  Impact on share prices is further muted by the fact that money that was going to move may have done so already Talks about changing to free float started more than two years ago following similar changes at FTSE Stoxx and other index com pilers While truly passive money would have waited until the end of trading yesterday to make the move many closet trackers have more discretion over timing The passives may have spent the last week or two fixing the prices their new shares will trade at on Friday It is this last activity if anything that will have had market impact and there have been some interesting share price movements in recent days The household goods company Henkel maker of Persil has 100 per cent free float and therefore stands to gain On Wednesday its shares were up 4 per cent a sharper daily move than usual But the day before they moved even more sharply in the opposite direction Another stock under scrutiny is pharmaceutical Altana not a member but possibly a candidate in September On Tuesday its shares jumped 6 per cent But once again there is doubt as drug stocks were having a good day and there remain hurdles to Altana's admission Two years ago the changes would have been more controversial when Deutsche Telekom was the biggest constituent Its demotion has in the end been achieved largely by the bursting of the technology bubble Perhaps the biggest significance of the reforms is that they represent a further step towards a maturing equity market in Germany Free float reforms became necessary because indicies were subverting investors' true intentions and in some cases those distortions were being exploited The Stoxx 50 may be about to eject Swedish telecoms group Ericsson languishing at position 61 in terms of market cap and falling fast If it is still below 60 on September 2 out it goes Because fund managers see this danger it tends to become self-fulfilling There is {XEU}44bn £28 42bn benchmarked against the Stoxx 50 enough to make a difference Alcatel will almost certainly be ejected with Tesco the leading candidate to replace it ,2
2002-06-20, Brazil's central bank yesterday maintained its prime interest rate at 18 5 per cent for the third consecutive month after recent market turmoil began fuelling inflation fears The central bank decision continues its tight monetary policy designed to meet an ambitious inflation-target of 5 5 per cent this year However it is likely to fuel criticism by opposition parties and several industries that the government's inflation targets are hurting economic growth excessively Gross domestic product during the first three months of the year grew only 1 34 per cent over the previous quarter and is down 0 73 per cent over the same period last year It is a direct result from the surge in country risk and the depreciation of the currency said Andre Loes the chief economist with Banco Santander in Sao Paulo Fears of a leftwing victory in October's presidential election have driven currency and bond prices close to their lowest levels since March 1999 The currency has fallen from R$2 30 in mid-April to less than R$2 70 against the dollar while the country risk premium has jumped from about 700 basis points to more than 13 per cent While inflation had shown signs of slowing in May it fell to 0 21 per cent from 0 8 per cent in April a currency depreciation of 9 per cent over the past month renewed fears of inflationary pressure The central bank yesterday adopted a downward bias meaning it could cut rates before its next monthly meeting Yet critics said its cautious move could undermine confidence in government measures announced last week to help calm financial markets It implies that they do not expect currency weakness to be temporary said Odair Abate the chief economist with Lloyds TSB in Sao Paulo The government said it would draw on a $10bn credit from the International Monetary Fund buy back $3bn in foreign debt and increase its primary budget surplus The country's leading banks earlier this week expected interest rates to fall to 17 per cent by the end of the year according to a central bank survey ,3
2002-06-13, One of the financial world's most popular parlour games is to ridicule the credit rating agencies which have failed to flag such corporate disasters as Enron As the wags have it Standard & Poor's should be renamed Poor Standards And Moody's is well just Moody But this is a trickier game to play if you happen to be the Japanese government Hauling the Moody's rating agency in front of the Japanese parliament yesterday to justify its recent downgrade may have been an amusing sideshow But it only reinforced the impression that the government is in denial about its looming fiscal problems On one level the Japanese government may be justified in criticising the credit rating agencies for suggesting there is now an increased risk of default on Japanese government bonds JGBs After all governments can always avoid outright default on their locally denominated debt by printing more money to pay their creditors unless that is they choose to emulate Russia in staging a default to wipe the slate clean Moreover Japan remains the world's biggest creditor nation boasts about Y1400000bn £7580bn of household financial assets and still runs a large current account surplus How can Moody's cut Japan's local currency debt rating by two notches to A2 ranking the country below Botswana which receives development aid from Tokyo The market also remains sanguine about Japan's debt position Yields on 10-year JGBs are about 1 37 per cent the lowest in any major economy Recent movements in the default swaps market in effect the insurance premium on JGBs suggest investors believe the risks of default are declining rather than rising The price of these swaps on 10-year JGBs has fallen from more than 60 basis points earlier this year to about 38 basis points But by puffing at the rating agencies the Japanese government is trying to blow a waterfall uphill It is obvious to everyone including the credit rating agencies that Japan cannot go on indefinitely pumping public money into a stagnant economy and amassing ever-larger amounts of debt Japan's public debt to gross domestic product ratio is now close to 140 per cent The JGB market appears to be the last outpost of the bubble economy All the rating agencies are doing by cutting Japan's rating is to suggest that the day of reckoning may come sooner rather than later Even if Japan can avoid the danger of default there is a growing risk of credit impairment Instead of rubbishing the messenger the Japanese government should heed the message ,2
2002-06-08, Donal Geaney chief executive of Elan acknowledged yesterday that he and other executives were under intense pressure to reverse the beleaguered pharmaceutical company's fortunes It will not be a question of resigning he said If we are not successful investors will vote with their feet  Elan until recently Ireland's largest quoted company has seen its shares tumble 90 per cent after admitting that profits last year would have been substantially lower if two off-balance sheet vehicles had been consolidated into the accounts The collapsing share price led to calls for Mr Geaney and Thomas Lynch chief financial officer to resign Until now they have resisted calls for a boardroom shake-out Yesterday the shares fell nearly 16 per cent to {XEU}7 50 in Dublin after it emerged the company which is under investigation for its accounting practices was seeking to liquidate three of its off-balance sheet vehicles Mr Geaney denied Elan faced liquidity problems However he admitted Elan had bungled its transformation from a drug delivery specialist earning its money from other pharmaceutical companies into a fully integrated biopharmaceuticals company with sales of its own The result was an over-complicated balance sheet he said With 2020 hindsight we would not have done it that way  He pledged to simplify Elan's balance sheet and cut debt by selling non-core assets within six months Once that is in place and we are seen to be implementing the plan we will get a revaluation he said David Maris pharmaceuticals analyst at CSFB said Elan was not as cash generative as it appeared from its reported numbers We are still uncertain whether Elan made any money last year A failure to face up to the underlying problems had made it a takeover target Management has been more interested in saying it didn't do anything wrong than addressing what they did wrong New management perhaps in combination with another company could get them back on track he said Mr Maris said the move to liquidate the special purpose entities raised questions about Elan's cashflow It appears they are trying to pay off balance sheet debt with the sale of off balance sheet assets Mr Maris said There's nothing wrong with that but they are selling below the price they paid  Mr Geaney said there were no immediate plans to sell Elan's stakes in the special purpose entities There would definitely be some devaluation if we sold them today We hope to take advantage of the market when it is strong  he said Elan had $1 4bn £950m in cash and debt repayments of $222m this year he added Critics say Elan's 55 joint ventures were used to disguise the cost of the company's research efforts ,2
2002-06-20, Whisper it softly but some at Westminster are wondering whether Peter Mandelson might be heading for a cabinet comeback It could happen not under Tony Blair they say but in a future government led by the former Northern Ireland secretary's arch-rival Gordon Brown At first sight the notion seems preposterous The chancellor's resentment at what he saw as Mr Mandelson's betrayal in 1994 when he backed Mr Blair instead of Mr Brown for the party leadership ran deep Previous attempts at reconciliation have failed Behind the thought however lies hard-headed realpolitik  New Labour is not over-endowed with creative talent at the top Take Mr Blair out of the equation and Mr Brown would find thin pickings if he came to form his own cabinet Mr Mandelson once derided as the Prince of darkness is undoubtedly a big-league politician Besides with Mr Blair out of the way the original source of the hurt Mr Brown being prevented from becoming prime minister would have been removed Some say Mr Brown's resentment continued not because of the 1994 events but because Mr Mandelson was a rival for Mr Blair's ear Mr Mandelson and Mr Brown are believed to have spoken several times in recent months Mr Mandelson has been complimentary about the chancellor's tax-for-health Budget describing it recently as a landmark for the government that should bolster the confidence and daring of its members Many obstacles stand in the way Mr Blair could cling on too long for the chancellor and other candidates could emerge It would be a remarkable twist if it were Mr Brown who enabled Mr Mandelson to emulate his grandfather Herbert Morrison by becoming foreign secretary Mr Mandelson is hedging his bets He recently described David Blunkett the chancellor's likeliest challenger as an example of the ministerial self-confidence that the government needs Reviewing a book by the home secretary last autumn he described Mr Blunkett as a genuinely inspirational and influential figure Mr Mandelson has delivered a frank reappraisal of New Labour mirroring that taking place inside the government He acknowledges that Labour has relied too much on media manipulation exaggerated some of its achievements and become too close to business He believes on the other hand that Labour has understated its achievement in tying benefits to work the chancellor's central contribution Mr Mandelson remains close to Mr Blair He was consulted last week for instance over the Black Rod crisis But Mr Blair has shown no appetite to have him back a third time ,3
2002-06-29, Canada is at last moving to institute a comprehensive national programme of listing public and privately-owned historic places together with financial incentives to ensure their preservation and upkeep Local frameworks are already in place says Christina Cameron director-general of National Historic Sites which is based in Hull in Quebec across the river from Ottawa in Ontario The need for a federal Historic Places Initiative HPI to help ensure the protection of such gems as Ottawa's Carier Square Drill Hall left is urgent In the past 30 years Canada has lost more than 20 per cent of its stock of pre-1920 buildings With them goes much of the tangible history of Canada needed to forge a community and give it roots Among the worst cases are Vancouver where 37 9 per cent of pre-1920 buildings have gone and Calgary where the figure is 35 4 per cent reflecting the recent building booms of the two cities Jean Chretien the Canadian prime minister has committed C$24m funding over three years to start the HPI and to prepare the Canadian Register of Historic Places This will put into one national list the 20000 places already on federal provincial and local registers It's a daunting task since at least 16 existing registers with differing systems will have to be co-ordinated The list will eventually be available on the web In the meantime conservation standards are being drafted and should be completed by spring of next year Work is also under way on drafting a Historic Places Bill This will assure legal protection for the 200 national historic sites the federal government owns and 264 prime federal historic buildings Also in this national protection category are Canada's World Heritage sites The bill will also provide for the federal government to protect archaeological sites on federal land and underwater sites such as wrecks in federal jurisdiction The provinces have all passed such legislation says Cameron Now the national government must catch up Federal departments will be required to consider heritage value in managing their buildings and it is hoped to set up a Canadian National Trust Canadians don't have the wealth to build an endowment like that of the National Trust in England Cameron says She envisages more a platform to champion the heritage Tax relief for maintaining historic buildings is a big concern akin to the US where a 10 per cent tax credit is given for work on a building on the national register provided it is certified to have been properly done Already 29000 urban properties there have been turned around  In Canada there are now 39 different municipal and provincial tax programmes Cameron says It is time to bring the federal government up to local standards  In due course other properties will be added to the Canadian register Cameron is confident there will be interest in having places designated And she is confident that once grants or tax credits are involved the register will have a positive cumulative long-term impact In the face of such large recent losses it is vital we cherish our national history Gerald Cadogan,3
2002-06-12, Pillar Property a developer of retail parks yesterday announced its intention to return £143m in capital to shareholders and unveiled plans to turn itself into a specialist property fund manager The company said it would also consider a further return of capital to shareholders in 2003 Raymond Mould chairman said We believe that it is more appropriate that the focus of Pillar's activities be concentrated on assets under management and that the emphasis should be on long-term earnings growth and for the company to be less capital intensive than it is now  The shares gained 7{1/2}p to 443p in heavy trading Pillar was an industry leader in creating the property fund manager model It has sold roughly £2bn in retail parks and City of London offices into two offshore trusts Hercules and Clout Both are listed in Jersey Pillar said it intended to reduce its stake in each of these trusts currently 48 per cent and 36 per cent using sale proceeds for returns of capital Humphrey Price finance director said the company was likely to pare its holdings to about half their current levels Pillar announced a pre-tax loss for the year to March 31 of £16 8m against a profit last time of £24 2m mostly reflecting the costs of transferring properties into Hercules Costs included a £15m charge from the break of existing swaps contracts a £8 4m charge on the sale price of the properties and a £10m tax charge However management and performance-related fees rose from £12 3m to £16m Losses per share were 4 5p against earnings of 9 7p Turnover fell from £201 6m to £86 3m largely reflecting the sales of property to the unit trusts Net asset value rose from 431p to 433p Comment  Pillar by its own admission is changing to an earnings-driven company from one whose strategy focuses on building NAV While the shift makes the company easier to understand to the generalist investor it makes less sense to the specialist property investor Applying an earnings-based model assuming a sector-wide average of 15 to 20 times earnings Pillar's fund management activities are worth 90p to 120p a share while its property assets are at 431p Stripping out tax and the break costs of debt the fund management business makes Pillar look something closer to 490-500p At current prices the shares look a buy The question is whether they should remain within the property sector ,2

2002-06-08, Tyco International was dealt another setback yesterday as the conglomerate's credit ratings were lowered to junk prompting a further 30 per cent slide in its share price The downgrades came at the end of a week in which Dennis Kozlowski Tyco's chairman and chief executive was indicted on charges of sales tax evasion The indictment which came a day after Mr Kozlowski had resigned has raised serious questions about Tyco's corporate governance and cast renewed doubts over its ability to reduce its debts Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's the credit ratings agencies justified their downgrades by pointing to the loss of management credibility caused by the indictment They also warned that a failure to complete the initial public offering of Tyco's financial services unit CIT would prompt more downgrades John Fort the former Tyco chief executive who took over from Mr Kozlowski on Monday attempted to reassure investors by promising that the CIT spin-off would be completed in June or July Our operations are tracking as expected he said The company also said it had hired the law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner to conduct an internal investigation Tyco shares plunged $4 50 to $10 10 their lowest for six years The downgrades came as Robert Morgenthau the Manhattan district attorney who brought the charges against Mr Kozlowski warned that executives of other US companies that have moved to Bermuda would face close scrutiny from his office In an interview with the Financial Times Mr Morgenthau said the Kozlowski case was a chance to set an example for executives contemplating moving their headquarters to Bermuda in order to lower their tax bills We will be less sympathetic to somebody who has been involved in tax avoidance ie by moving offshore than somebody who is a first-time sinner he said We want to get as much of a deterrent impact as we can  This week's indictment of Mr Kozlowski covers his alleged failure to pay $1m in New York sales taxes on art purchases and has no direct connection to Tyco's fully legal decision to move its domicile to Bermuda However Mr Morgenthau made it clear that the indictment reflected his opposition to the use of tax havens by US companies We feel strongly that people have to pay their taxes whether they are too high or too low  Mr Kozlowski's indictment has caused investors still reeling from the Enron fallout to further question the probity of US executives The investigation of Mr Kozlowski's tax affairs has recently broadened to examine the way he paid for the paintings people close to the issue said Mr Kozlowski is understood to have used a Tyco account to purchase some of the paintings The company is also thought to have paid for Mr Kozlowski's apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York which he acquired for $18m two years ago It is unclear whether Tyco's board was aware of the purchases If the board was not told this could provide evidence that the company's financial controls were inadequate leading to further charges people close to the probe said Tyco is still waiting for approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to press ahead with the IPO of its CIT leasing arm so it can pay off some of its borrowings Greed and fear return Page 8 Man in the news Page 9 CIT sale Page 12 World stocks Page 15 www ft com/tyco,2

2002-06-25, Turkey once again stands at a perilous crossroads This time both its latest economic stabilisation programme and its bid to join the European Union hang in the balance I have no doubt that Turkey has a brilliant future says Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik a Turkish parliamentarian and former minister for EU affairs The question is what price we will pay to get there  The challenges facing the geostrategically vital Nato member at home and abroad are magnified by political instability that impairs the country's decision-making abilities Turkish financial markets have fallen dramatically since the beginning of May when Bulent Ecevit the 77-year-old prime minister was admitted to hospital for 10 days Since he began convalescence at home disagreements within his three-party coalition over reforms needed to qualify for membership of the EU have fuelled fears that the government may collapse Financial turmoil threatens to reverse the considerable successes of Turkey's latest economic rescue programme backed by a $16 3bn loan from the International Monetary Fund Mr Ecevit who insists he is getting better has rejected calls for his resignation on the grounds that his departure would cause chaos Kemal Dervis the popular economy minister has called for a clear date to be set for early elections to reduce uncertainty The business community has argued on the contrary that electioneering could hurt the fragile shoots of an incipient economic recovery After a 10 per cent contraction in the economy last year industrial production picked up dramatically in March and April Inflation has also been falling steadily from 68 per cent last December to 46 per cent in May Until the recent turmoil this had put inflation on course comfortably to meet the official year-end target of 35 per cent The biggest headache thrown up by the latest crisis is a rise in interest rates from 53 per cent since the beginning of May to about 73 per cent last week Unless Ankara manages to reverse such sentiment these unsustainable interest rates could raise concerns about Turkey's ability to service its public sector debt The IMF which has lent Turkey a total of $30bn since the present government embarked on a first failed stabilisation programme in January 2000 insists strict implementation of the economic programme is the antidote to political uncertainty Turkey's 19th standby accord with the IMF is its most comprehensive It combines tight fiscal and monetary policy with structural reforms to put Turkey's public finances on a sound long-term footing Structural reforms still to come range from privatisation and energy liberalisation to an overhaul of bureaucratic restrictions on foreign investment Considerable progress has been achieved in restructuring the banking sector An encouraging start has been made in agriculture with a switch to direct income support away from farm price subsidies Such reform is essential to make the economy more efficient and meet economic criteria for EU accession Yet Turkey's main problem with the EU has little to do with economics and everything to do with the twin political problems of human rights and Cyprus Ankara is trying to persuade the EU to set a date at its Copenhagen summit in December for formal accession talks to start Mesut Yilmaz deputy prime minister responsible for the EU claims Turkey needs the reassurance of a clear date to overcome anti-EU forces he argues are as strong as the country's pro-EU majority In recent months he has increasingly pointed the finger at the National Action Party MHP the second largest coalition partner as blocking Turkey's path to accession In full-page newspaper advertisements Tusiad the business federation last month demanded action by government and parliament to safeguard Turkey's vital EU project Shortly afterwards 180 non-governmental organisations gathered in Istanbul to show support for EU membership on behalf of the 15m people they claim to represent While the MHP opposes human rights reforms needed to advance Turkey's EU candidacy the party has said it will not chance a government crisis if they are approved with opposition support This appeared to clear the way for a vote to abolish the death penalty and allow Kurdish-language education and broadcasting Devlet Bahceli MHP leader and deputy prime minister also warned that his party would be prepared to leave the government if its coalition partners made a habit of agreeing with the opposition The opposition consists of two Islamist parties that claim they are all in favour of the EU-related reforms plus the centre-right True Path Party led by Tansu Ciller As Turkey's first female prime minister Ms Ciller negotiated Turkey's customs union with the EU in the 1990s But she is now wavering over human rights reform in an attempt to grab some of hardline nationalist vote from the MHP The irony of such ambivalence is that opinion polls consistently show two-thirds of Turks support EU membership Much of the blame for an apparent disconnection between politicians and voters lies with an ailing political system in a democracy that is only 50 years old Immaturity among politicians is exacerbated by three military coups since 1960 Although Turkey's generals have indicated they will no longer intervene directly in politics they are still seen as a source of stability in times of trouble They have made clear they disapprove of one of the leading potential contenders in a forthcoming election This helps to explain why public prosecutors with the clear support of the military are taking legal action to ban Recep Tayyip Erdogan the charismatic Islamist leader who maintains he is no longer an Islamist They cite his conviction for inciting hatred on religious grounds as the reason for a ban As a western diplomat explains The army is seen by many Turks as providing stability if everything else goes wrong Yet at the same The government's critics argue an election could create a stronger constituency for reform Some fear an election could generate a destructive reaction by voters Not only could they punish the government after devastating devaluation in 2001 when an economic stabilisation programme collapsed They may also reject any new faces who promise to do a better job with the same sort of reforms This gives a powerful incentive for like minded reformists such as the popular Mr Dervis who has yet to declare his political intentions and Mehmet Ali Bayar brother of the former privatisation chief to unite Given a tendency among Turkish politicians to all want to be the boss Mr Dervis has set an encouraging precedent by volunteering to take a number two slot in any party he might join The next elections expected before they are due in 2004 will be a crucial test for Turkish democracy They will determine whether politicians can meet the expectations of a nation hungry for political leadership which is essential to realising their country's economic potential and EU aspirations ,2
2002-04-06, The level of share prices is essentially a function of two things the level of corporate profits and the rating investors are willing to award those profits Market valuation is still a subject for intense debate with some commentators such as Andrew Smithers of investment advisers Smithers & Co arguing that US equities remain substantially overvalued But it is hard to find a bull who believes shares are significantly under valued they tend to argue that valuations are fair and that share prices will be lifted by a rebound in corporate profits The outlook for profits is thus central to the bullish case In both the US and the UK profits peaked as a proportion of gross domestic product GDP in 1997 The subsequent decline in profit share was in sharp contrast to the rapid growth in earnings per share announced particularly in the US by the quoted sector in 1998 and 1999 This discrepancy can be explained in a number of ways One might be that quoted companies were performing better than the unquoted sector This may well have been the case but it is hard to imagine that this factor accounted for more than a small part of the gap given the weight of the quoted sector within the economy It takes an awful lot of Mom-and-Pop grocery stores to equal one Microsoft A second explanation lies in the extra gearing taken on by the corporate sector during the late 1990s Share buy-backs can boost earnings per share without improving the underlying profitability of the company A third explanation favoured by James Montier of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein is that quoted company earnings have been manipulated He points to academic research analysing 1915 firms that had track records of 41 quarters Statistically no more than 36 should have reported 17 consecutive quarters of earnings-per-share increases in fact 171 did so The after-effects of this manipulation could be quite significant as the global economy and the corporate sector recover Because US corporate profits dropped to the bottom end of the cyclical range last year it is natural to expect them to bounce sharply and such a trend was observed in the GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2001 But the danger is that this rebound may simply allow the gap to close between the real profit numbers as represented by the national accounts figures and the manipulated numbers as represented by quoted earnings per share The latter may not grow as quickly as the bulls hope Another significant issue is whether there may be structural factors pushing down the profit share Figures indicate that the golden era for corporate profitability was in the 1950s and 1960s At that stage the world economy was relatively closed capital movements were restricted by exchange controls and domestic manufacturers enjoyed protection from foreign competition Back then for example the big three US car manufacturers did not have to worry about competition from Japan But the modern era of globalisation and the information revolution which has made customers more aware of pricing anomalies may have transferred power from producers to consumers Peter Oppenheimer global strategist at the HSBC banking group points out that many companies are finding that their prices are set globally but their labour costs are still determined locally In the US and UK labour markets still remain pretty tight in spite of the recent economic slowdown A related issue is the fall in the real and nominal cost of capital during the 1990s as bond yields declined In the long run one would expect the return on capital to equal the cost of capital But what seems to have happened is that the fall in yields prompted a degree of money illusion in the corporate sector Managers forgot that nominal and real returns were also bound to decline and thus sanctioned more investment projects than were needed Of course in the long run this excess capital was bound to drive returns down further through increased competition In the short term however this extra investment disguised the fundamental problem To use nominal figures say that an economy has $1000bn of capital and a return of 10 per cent equivalent to profits of $100bn Were returns to fall to 7 per cent that would imply a $30bn fall in profits However the corporate sector invests a further $1000bn of capital Thus even at a 7 per cent return profits still rise to $140bn Furthermore if there is a lag between the fall in the cost of capital and the fall in returns as there seems to have been in the 1990s then profits will be given a further temporary boost Eventually however this process will come unstuck At some point business will stop investing and thus there will be no extra capital to boost the headline level of profits The forces driving down the average return on capital will then come into play causing a fall in the overall level of profits This probably explains why in spite of the very mild US economic slowdown of 2001 profits fell so sharply The signs from the corporate bond market are that the cost of capital is now rising the signals from the equity market are more ambiguous Eventually of course this will drive up returns But companies may find life difficult in the interim squeezed as they will be between a higher cost of capital and lower returns None of the above rules out a rebound in profits this year as volumes expand while costs remain subdued But this column takes the long view and over the next five years or so the prospects for profits do not look encouraging philip coggan@ft com,2

2002-06-15, US wireless stocks collapsed yesterday after industry bellwether Sprint PCS said it would add in its current quarter only about half the number of subscribers Wall Street had expected Investors' confidence in the telecommunications sector was at an all-time low following a spate of recent credit rating downgrades and warnings by small wireless carriers of lower than anticipated customer growth Shares in Sprint PCS hit a new low yesterday dropping 26 per cent to $4 40 while its two affiliates Airgate PCS and Alamosa lost 7 and 11 per cent respectively The affiliates which sell mobile phone services under the Sprint PCS brand name both warned in the past week they would report fewer-than-expected customer additions in the current quarter AT&T Wireless the third-largest US carrier fell 9 per cent to $5 75 The stock was downgraded by Michael Rollins analyst at Salomon Smith Barney who said We believe the results of Sprint PCS show a tougher competitive environment and potentially slower industry growth  However Nextel Communications which announced this week that it might beat full-year forecasts and was experiencing solid subscriber additions closed up 8 per cent at $4 48 Sprint PCS which for the last 13 quarters has led the industry in terms of growth has for the first time underperformed the industry overall said Thomas Lee head wireless analyst with JP Morgan Securities Mr Lee along with several other Wall Street analysts lowered his Sprint PCS rating yesterday Nextel also suffered yesterday from Wall Street downgrades Sprint PCS which trades as a tracking stock to its parent company Sprint said total customer growth for the year would be 10-15 per cent below its initial estimate of 3m new subscribers This is in spite of the fact that Sprint PCS plans to introduce third-generation wireless services this summer the first nationwide launch of its kind Mr Lee said those services which will include the introduction of mobile phones with coloured screens would help spark some excitement among customers but was unlikely to prompt much investor enthusiasm It takes time to repair sentiment he said predicting it would be at least three or four months before the market would see even modest gains in wireless stocks In fact consolidation among the six nationwide carriers could be the only true solution to the sector's slump It will be extremely difficult to make any money in this market until there's consolidation said Peter Friedland analyst with WR Hambrecht Sprint PCS said it expected to add 300000 new customers in its second quarter compared with the 600000-650000 Wall Street anticipated The carrier said it would reduce its wireless capital expenditures by $100m to $3 3bn for the year because of the slower growth Meanwhile shares in parent company Sprint also took a nose-dive yesterday falling 17 per cent to $11 75 Sprint said full-year revenues would decline at a mid-single digit rate compared with its initial forecast of a low-single digit rate In 2001 Sprint had $16 9bn in sales Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's credit rating last week to just one notch above junk status Late yesterday Standard & Poor's followed suit cutting its credit rating on the company to BBB- from BBB and lowering its short-term credit rating to A3 from A2 However S&P gave Sprint a stable outlook Airgate PCS and Alamosa closed down 7 per cent at $1 42 and 11 per cent at $1 31 respectively ,2

2002-06-15, The week's news has not been comforting reading for UK investors in technology funds Three more technology and communications stocks were removed from the FTSE 100 the stock market index of Britain's biggest companies At the height of dotcom fever in spring 2000 nine technology media and telecoms TMT companies were promoted into the FTSE 100 This week Logica ARM and Electrocomponents have fallen out and only Sage the accountancy software company remains In a week when the FTSE has dropped to pre-September 11 levels investors are being starved of good news This is in marked contrast to the TMT boom two years ago when private investors couldn't escape from advertisements and promotional literature splashing the virtues of investing in TMT across the UK Now the marketing managers have gone quiet as investors shy away from these high-risk funds in the face of embarrassingly poor returns Shares have fallen so far it is tempting to tell clients to hold on but just because shares have dropped 90 per cent it doesn't mean they can't drop another 90 per cent says Robert Leonard a director of Advisory and Brokerage Services In many cases we still need to see evidence of profitability to justify the price multiples  Trust managers putting client's money into technology haven't had a great deal of comfort to hand out to investors either Polar Capital Technology one of the older investment trusts in the sector with 12000 shareholders reported net asset falls of nearly a third this year That is better than most technology investment trusts which on average have lost half investors' money in the past year But Polar Capital's fund manager Brian Ashford-Russell is notably downbeat about the sector He warned investors not to expect any big sustainable recovery to former highs in technology shares There may be a bounce in the market by the end of the year But he warns investors the upturn is unlikely to be sustained and the sector will probably not rise anywhere near its peak values There will be more corporate governance shocks more bankruptcies and more share price corrections he says Even the more positive managers can't quite summon the courage to be outright bulls Michael Bourne manager of Finsbury Technology investment trust the oldest trust in the sector is less depressed than many There's a lot of doom and gloom he says He is beginning to use negative press coverage to increase Finsbury's exposure to technology The situation now he says is a complete reverse of the TMT boom two years ago and that may signal it is a good time to buy depending on the general outlook for the economy Unlike the telecoms sector which is laden with debt many technology companies are rich with the cash raised two years ago says Stuart O'Gorman who runs Henderson Global Investor's Global Technology unit trust But that means technology companies that should go bust are able to eke out their cash and hang on They are playing a game of last man standing he says Unfortunately the result is that the much needed clean-out of the industry is being delayed There are selected opportunities in some sub-sectors and some companies are still good investments says Mr O'Gorman Take Cisco It is trading on less than 20 times its free cashflow and it generated $3bn free cash in the first half of the year  However it will be an uphill struggle to re-awaken investor fervour Most investors who put money in technology trusts any time in the last two years have had a very painful ride Unit trust assets are down at least a third over one and three years European TMT trusts fared worse Even Aberdeen Asset Management which has one of the largest teams in the sector and runs some of the longest-standing technology unit trusts in the UK couldn't prevent its European Technology unit trust returns halving in a year To make it worse some of the technology investment trusts issued around the height of the TMT boom are split capital investment trusts and have lost nearly all of investor's money Many of these splits which separate out and pay income and capital returns to different shareholders were also bar-bell trusts They invested in high growth TMT stocks to provide the growth to pay off capital shareholders And they invested in high-yielding corporate bonds many of them also TMT bonds to provide a high income to holders of income shares When the market collapsed and TMT borrowers defaulted or their credit ratings were slashed these trusts suffered a double blow Falling assets were compounded by high debt and heavy investment in fellow splits There are some positive signs The sector may begin to pick up a little after the summer Alan Ray investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities points out that TMT investment trusts which historically have traded at premiums to assets have now fallen to discounts That may indicate a low in sentiment in the sector However managers warn investors to be realistic about the cyclical nature of some areas in technology Mr O'Gorman warns that active management is the key It's important to rotate in and out of sectors in this market Mr Ashford-Russell agrees The leaders of the last cycle are rarely leaders of the next cycle ,2

2002-06-29, Edgar Bronfman Jr scion of the wealthy North American family has wasted little time identifying his next business gamble The 47-year-old this week decided that Asprey and Garrard the jewellery group is a must-have luxury accessory His decision to take a 40 per cent stake in A&G comes three months after he gave up his executive role at Vivendi Universal the indebted French media group whose shares have nose-dived But buying a stake in the Bond Street luxury goods group is no big deal even if the size of his investment was not made public After all this is the man who spent six years building up Seagram the drinks Universal Pictures music and theme parks conglomerate controlled by his family before selling it to Vivendi in a $34bn £23 2bn share deal two years ago Fortuitously that sale was near the peak of the telecoms media and technology cycle although he was less lucky with the timing of Seagram's disposal of its 23 per cent stake in DuPont the US chemicals group in 1995 Speaking from A&G's offices near Bond Street Mr Bronfman is guarded about the board upheavals at Vivendi Universal He remains a non-executive and his family remains Vivendi's largest investor though they have sold down their stake to about 6 7 per cent Asked whether the Bronfmans were to challenge Jean-Marie Messier Vivendi Universal's embattled chief executive and call a meeting to force his dismissal Mr Bronfman refused to discuss the matter When the time comes for me to comment I will do so he said The investment in A&G has been made via a partnership of Mr Bronfman Jr his father and brother Mr Bronfman is widely expected to help A&G's attempts to become a global luxury goods group As well as financial muscle the former songwriter who has written lyrics for the likes of Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand brings management skills and a network of contacts Some of these were built up during his ownership of Universal Pictures and he is a close friend of Hollywood directors and producers Steven Spielberg and David Geffen According to Mr Bronfman the opportunity to invest in A&G resulted from a coincidence about three months ago He was looking around for what to do next after deciding to step down from Vivendi Universal when he met Lawrence Stroll co-chairman of A&G and an old friend at a social engagement I ran into Lawrence and I thought that his plans for A&G sounded very interesting he said acknowledging that his decision to invest in the luxury goods sector was a departure It's not exactly what I have done before Yes it is different and that holds part of the interest  However he said that building A&G internationally was not inconsistent with his previous experience at the helm of Seagram for six years The opportunity is clear and very large The question is can we execute it I believe we can he said I think there is no company that has the length of history that Asprey and Garrard both have There is no British-based luxury lifestyle house and no other opportunity in Britain with the same credibility he said Mr Bronfman says he is in for the long term Where the luxury goods market stands at any one time is irrelevant We intend to build the business over five 10 15 years  He is joined as an investor by TAG the Luxembourg-based investment company and former owner of TAG Heuer watches which has taken a 10 per cent interest in A&G A&G's current owners Tommy Hilfiger co-chairmen Mr Stroll and Silous Chou acquired Asprey and Garrard from the Brunei royal family for an undisclosed sum two years ago They still retain 50 per cent Messrs Stroll and Chou were keen this week to emphasise that this was not a sale but new partners coming in Even so they will need to be patient long-term and deep-pocketed investors if A&G is to fufil its goal The business generated sales of more than £50m in the year to March 31 2001 its last published accounts But A&G plans to spend more than $200m in the next five years rolling out Asprey and Garrard stores which now trade as distinct units At least £30m will be spent on the development of Asprey in Bond Street to double its selling space It currently trades from a small corner of the site awaiting its re-opening in autumn 2003 Garrard meantime will return to its former home in Albemarle Street ahead of its opening in September Asprey in New York recently signed a lease for a flagship store in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and 56th As well as silver jewellery watches and leather goods the range will be extended to shoes fashion accessories chinaware glassware in addition to hand-made guns and polo equipment A further 10 stores are planned in the next five years rising to a network of up to 40 by 2012 A&G is currently building up large design teams Garrard whose creative director is Jade Jagger will have 15 designers while Hussein Chalayan takes a similar role at Asprey which will have 40 Gianluca Brozzetti the former president of Louis Vuitton who is A&G chief executive said the three large areas of spending would be in-store build-up product development and marketing The business plan is on paper and we now have to execute it he said From a strategic management point of view Mr Bronfman will strengthen the visibility of the project in North America  Mr Stroll said We don't have the 9/11 drama to deal with Our competitors are mature for us it is about building an opening to start with We are all about growth for the next 15 years We don't have the trading issues to deal with  Mr Bronfman said earlier this year that he wanted to get active in two or three meaningful activities He hopes A&G will realise part of that ambition ,1

2002-04-23, Britain's power and gas transmission monopolies are planning a spending spree in the US on completion of a proposed £15bn merger to create Europe's fourth-largest utility National Grid the electricity transmission utility and Lattice Group the gas transmission company that owns Transco yesterday said their combination would leave them in a strong position for acquisitions in the north east US power and gas markets The deal will be scrutinised by UK and US competition authorities but does not require approval by the European Commission because the companies do not have substantial sales in Europe Competition lawyers said one potential regulatory hurdle would be the merged group's increased power over companies that supply both electricity and gas The Association of Electricity Producers which represents power station owners and Energywatch which represents consumers expressed reservations at the size of the combined group Ann Robinson the chair of Energywatch said We want to hear that the new company will be committed first and foremost to delivering higher quality standards of service and greater value for money to UK consumers  But Roger Urwin chief executive of National Grid said initial soundings with energy and competition regulators had not raised any objections to the merger in principle Analysts said the deal appeared to make strategic sense for both companies though the price offered to Lattice shareholders at the equivalent of 184p a share was less than the 198p considered fair value for the assets This raised the possibility that there could be a counter-bid for Lattice though this was thought by most analysts to be unlikely Shares in Lattice which was spun out from the former British Gas in 2000 closed up 11 per cent at 192p National Grid rose 3 per cent to 505p An observer close to the deal said the combined group would be capable of a $3bn acquisition in the US similar to National Grid's purchase of Niagara Mowhawk in 2000 every two years On completion National Grid shareholders will hold 57 3 per cent of the company and Lattice shareholders will hold about 42 7 per cent The combined market capitalisation of the groups based on Friday's close is £14 8bn and the companies each have debt of about £7bn Under the terms of the deal National Grid shareholders will retain their shares in the company to be renamed National Grid Transco and Lattice shareholders will receive 0 375 shares in the enlarged group for each Lattice Share The transaction is expected to be earnings enhancing in the first full year and to generate savings of at least £100m a year by the end of the first full year after the merger Editorial Comment Page 18 Observer Page 19 Lex Page 20 Energetic Brits Page 22 www ft com/energy,1
2002-04-18, Gordon Brown yesterday decided to pay for the huge increases in health expenditure with a mixture of more optimistic forecasts for growth in the economy looser fiscal policy in the medium term and tax increases Mr Brown now expects a small fiscal tightening in the short term this year and next the effect of his own forecasting changes Net borrowing in the fiscal year just ended in March was £1 3bn which was lower than November's forecast of £2 5bn The deficit this year is expected to be £11bn lower than the £12 forecast in November's pre-Budget report and will rise to £13bn next year instead of November's £15bn But in order to help fund investment in public infrastructure Mr Brown has decided to increase borrowing longer-term Net debt will amount to 31 per cent of GDP by 2006-7 Significantly the chancellor did not expect to rely solely on an increased tax burden for an uplift in revenues He adopted a more optimistic underlying rate of growth forecast from 2{1/4} per cent to 2{1/2} per cent This will boost government revenues by £1bn a year a total of £5bn by 2006-07 They are now taking a bolder approach to the growth potential of the economy and using bolder growth assumptions to underpin their arithmetic said Geoffrey Dicks UK economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland The gross domestic product forecast for this year was left unchanged at 2-2 5 per cent Increased taxes will also play their part in generating revenues for Mr Brown to spend on health and other priorities After a small net tax reduction of £905m this year the total tax take will rise by £6 1bn in 2003-4 and by £7 6bn the following year The main tax rise in National Insurance contributions will take place next year thereby postponing the pain for consumers who have been the main engine for economic growth over the past 18 months These tax increases are necessary to pay for government spending which will rise from 39 8 per cent of gross domestic product this year to 41 9 per cent in 2006-7 Economic analysts said there were few implications for interest rates because the overall health of the public finances was more-or-less unchanged the changes in prospective borrowing amount to less than half a per cent of GDP in any year Adjusting for the economic cycle the government plans to reduce its surplus of tax revenues over current expenditure from 1 per cent to 0 5 per cent of GDP between last year and this year This is within the chancellor's self-imposed golden rule that current government spending should be matched by current receipts over the economic cycle but the drop reduces the chancellor's margin for error By 2006-07 the government plans to restore the cyclically adjusted surplus on the current budget to 0 7 per cent of GDP the level set previously But though the public finances appear to be in good shape still despite the additional spending Mr Brown's plans for health spending extend beyond 2006 Analysts pointed out that unless further tax rises are implemented in future budgets public finances would deteriorate after that and Mr Brown might fail to meet his self-imposed rules They suggested this would mean further pain for tax payers in future budgets MPC minutes Page 34,3

2002-04-25, Alittle more than a year after the merger that created GlaxoSmithKline the giant Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group is coming under intense scrutiny The group yesterday announced a 17 per cent increase in first quarter earnings per share on top of 19 per cent growth last year But the stock market has not been impressed Even after yesterday's 2 per cent rise to £16 73 GSK shares are still well below their level at the merger of £18 77 and trade at a discount of about 15 per cent to the other European drugs groups And there is talk about GSK making another acquisition to keep earnings growing strongly once all the merger cost savings have been achieved They are a tiny bit stuck says Paul Diggle at West LB Panmure If anything in their schedule goes wrong they might find they have to do another deal  Jean-Pierre Garnier GSK's chief executive tried yesterday to nip the acquisition speculation in the bud and highlighted the existing growth potential You never say never about deals but our number one priority at the moment is to build up our new drugs pipeline he said We have a lot to exploit internally and we need to make sure we execute well on those opportunities Acquisitions can be a distraction  The company had 118 projects in clinical development making its pipeline one of the industry's strongest Of 19 products licensed from other companies at least two Vardenafil Bayer's erectile dysfunction drug and Wellbutrin XL a once-a-day version of its depression treatment had sales potential of more than $1bn a year Like everyone else we need a couple of good opportunities Mr Garnier said But we have a great position at the starting gate and we intend to deliver a very different company to shareholders in 2005  One factor behind the share price underperformance has been patents The company has lost a string of recent cases in the US threatening the patent protection of two of its best-selling drugs the antibiotic Augementin and another anti-depressant Paxil Underlying the patent problems however have been concerns about the company's research operations The risk of research projects failing before they reach the market is something all pharmaceutical companies live with But GSK has disappointed more than most Earlier this month the company handed back the rights for Factive an antibiotic for which it once had high hopes Lotronex for irritable bowel syndrome might yet make it yet through regulators but will have only limited sales Other projects to have encountered problems in the past two years include Relenza for flu Raxar for infections and Romozin for diabetes Another new diabetes drug was withdrawn in October Glaxo's big problem is its pipeline but the only way to fix that is by innovation said Kevin Scotcher at SG Cowen In-licensing licensing products from other companies can keep profits going for a few years but it is not an answer  Some investors might welcome it if GSK acquired a company with a strong pipeline and there have been rumours about Bristol-Myers Squibb one of the largest US companies whose shares fell sharply last month after a series of mishaps Others who question GSK's ability to run its current huge research operation say that adding another large bureaucracy through acquisition would solve nothing We believe the benefits of mega-companies such as Pfizer and GSK have yet to be conclusively demonstrated said Denise Anderson at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich In particular we worry that their huge size will stifle creativity resulting in an expensive dependence on in- licenced drugs  But in spite of the doubters GSK's results continue to outstrip many of its rivals some of which are predicting that this will be a lean year Boosted by strong sales of Advair its new asthma drug GSK says it will show mid-teens growth in earnings per share this year and a low teens increase next year Analysts emphasise the group's ability to squeeze ever more sales from existing products Mr Garnier thinks the strength of ongoing operations will win over the doubters We have done a big merger already We are happy where we are he says www ft com/healthcare,1
2002-06-26, The skies haveturned distinctly unfriendly for United Airlines the carrier that once championed the upbeat slogan Fly the Friendly Skies The second-largest airline in the US has been losing about $5m a day Jack Creighton its interim chief executive is due to leave in the autumn several unions are unwilling to negotiate cuts and on Monday it applied for $1 8bn in federal loan guarantees amid concern about access to the capital markets United has been forced into this unseemly position by a slow recovery in airline travel sluggish business demand and relatively weak financial performance compared with rivals such as Continental But while its suffering is clear even its chief executive has admitted that without the loan the airline's future is not in doubt It still has about $2 6bn of cash on its balance sheet and according to Reno Bianchi analyst at Salomon Smith Barney could still have about $500m of cash at the end of next year That has led many analysts to question whether it qualifies for the federal scheme which so far has only been used to bail out America West an airline on the verge of bankruptcy So why is United applying for a loan that it may not get and that taints it as an airline in financial distress United said it needs the loan guarantee for three reasons It has $850m of debt maturing in the fourth quarter and $125m due next year We have had some discussions about rolling it over but they the lenders made it clear they wanted to get repaid says Jake Brace finance director Second although United has pushed back the delivery of new aircraft to 2004 it intends to spend about $500m on non-aircraft capital spending next year Although that would leave United with about $1 1bn of cash losses are forecast to continue In the first quarter operating losses were $5m a day but analysts expect that to shrink in the coming quarters However assuming losses continue at about $2m a day for another year an extreme assumption that would still leave about $400m in one year's time Finally United argues that it must improve liquidity Traditionally airlines operated with a low level of cash In the late 1990s we targeted about $750m But that was premised on the belief that we had ready access to the capital markets September 11 changed all that and caused us to rethink    The cash flow from operations will be modest and revenue is not back to where we need to be says Mr Brace At issue for the Air Transportation Stabilisation Board is whether United can access the capital markets or other lenders It has more than $2bn of aircraft that could be used as collateral to raise cash In January when market conditions were far worse it raised $775m to re-finance leased debt on 21 Boeing 737s Mr Brace contends such avenues are closing Access to the traditional markets was greatly diminished so we turned to non-traditional lenders like Boeing and Airbus and high-yield finance companies but we would prefer not to use them as cost and the terms are worse than we were used to dealing with  Even if the ATSB decides United has a case terms are unclear The government demanded warrants to buy 33 per cent of America West in return for its loan United may also have to hand over warrants or allow the government to benefit from any recovery says Tom Gallagher an investment banker at Wachovia Mr Brace is keen to avoid dilution United plans to secure its loan with aircraft and other non-aircraft assets America West did not have a lot of collateral to ensure payment so had to give the government some stock In our case we have collateral to mitigate the risk    so equity in our case does not make sense  United must also convince its unions to agree wage cuts one condition for getting federal loans Only the Airline Pilots Association has tentatively agreed concessions in return for share options Others are more reluctant Dawn Deeks of the Flight Attendants Association says There are no discussions about concessions Period  Some analysts are also sceptical of the pilots' cuts Jamie Baker analyst at JP Morgan says A 10 per cent wage cut sounds good right Not so fast Year two of the proposal includes a sharp 7 per cent raise followed by 8 and 8 6 per cent raises By the end of the agreement period wages will actually be higher than under the current contract  So United executives face tough negotiations treading the line between talking up its need to the government while also ensuring that if that fails it is not seen as such a corporate dud that it can no longer access money from other sources ,2

2002-06-06, Real Madrid confirmed its supremacy in European football by winning the European Cup for the ninth time in Glasgow last month For Florentino Perez it was the sweetest moment since he became chairman of the club two years ago A few weeks before Mr Perez had managed to put his building company ACS into the Champions League of the European construction industry In a surprise move ACS number three in Spain bought a controlling stake in Dragados the market leader The combined business ranks among the top five construction giants in the continent Football has a special attraction for the bricks-and-mortar-sector in Spain since Mr Perez is not the first nor the only construction manager to run a big club He took office from Lorenzo Sanz an astute construction and real estate entrepreneur who came under suspicion for mishandling the club's accounts To guarantee transparency Mr Perez agreed never to do business with the club The same rule applies to other honorary executives who include Fernando Fernandez Tapias head of the Madrid employers association and Juan Abello an influential businessman They are regularly joined in the presidential box at Real's Bernabeu Stadium by government ministers and local authority leaders Prime minister Jose Maria Aznar has been a staunch Real supporter all his life allowing a revival of the old jibe club of the regime FC Barcelona also attracts a business and political elite and was run for 22 years by Josep Luis Nunez one of Catalonia's most important construction magnates Its board still includes several representatives from the brick-and-mortar-sector For politicians starting with Catalan prime minister Jordi Pujol it is almost a patriotic duty to show up at Barca's Nou Camp stadium Hosting the political authorities at your club is obviously not bad for business says Santiago Molina of Ibersecurities Last year a huge property deal by Real allowed the club to wipe out a {XEU}300m debt The munipicipality agreed to upgrade its training grounds in a sought-after part of town so the club could sell it to private investors In exchange the city kept a large part of the property The council earns a lot of money with this deal Mr Perez tells critics They don't pay a single peseta and they get an office block worth Ptas 30bn Those who criticise this are just a bit jealous  While some football bosses enjoy rubbing shoulders with politicians others find their relation with the public powers uncomfortable The day Atletico Madrid assured their return to the Primera Division in April the club's owner and chairman Jesus Gil resigned Mr Gil another construction magnate also stepped down as mayor of seaside resort Marbella after being disqualified from holding public offices including sports clubs He is facing trials for embezzlement of public money in Marbella as well as irregularities at Atletico Mr Gil served his first jail sentence under Franco after a building he had constructed using low quality materials collapsed burying dozens of people Pardoned by Franco he has become an admirer of the late dictator Atletico was temporarily confiscated and managed by a judge two years ago Many supporters agree with the chairman that this intervention caused the painful relegation of the nine-times Spanish champions Mr Gil is convinced the government used the courts to erase his populist right-wing party named Grupo Independiente Liberal GIL from the political map Like Mr Gil Jose Maria Ruiz Mateos owner of Rayo Vallecano the capital's third top division side claims to be a victim of persecution His company Rumasa a conglomerate comprising a number of construction and real estate companies banks and department stores and was expropriated in 1983 by the former socialist government Mr Ruiz Mateos has since fought countless court-battles to recover his business empire In 1992 he turned up in a Superman outfit at a local bank branch to buy Rayo which he then took into the first division The team's shirts now show a bee on a yellow hexagon the logo of Rumasa as a reminder of his claims And when a few months ago Rayo was deep in the relegation zone the Ruiz Mateos family had no doubt that a string of unfortunate refereeing decisions against them had a political background to force them out of the football business The conspiracy theory however proved wrong and Rayo comfortably managed to stay in the top flight It seems that no matter who is sitting next to the football bosses at the ground matches are still being decided on the green pitch ,3
2002-06-04, Investors sold off shares of Tyco yesterday erasing any chance of a rally on Wall Street in spite of strong manufacturing data Losses accelerated late in the session with the Dow Jones Industrial Average unofficially closing down 215 46 at 9709 79 its lowest close since early February The S&P 500 index lost 26 52 to 1040 62 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 53 17 or 3 3 per cent to 1562 56 The Institute of Supply Management said its headline manufacturing business index reached its highest level in more than two years last month up to 55 7 from 53 9 in April Any number above 50 represents expansion in the sector But the news could not cancel out more worries about integrity on the Street Shares of Tyco fell 26 9 per cent to $16 05 after the chairman and chief executive of the beleaguered industrial conglomerate Dennis Kozlowski announced his resignation for personal reasons The move followed a report in The New York Times that he was under criminal investigation for suspected tax evasion Investors sold shares of El Paso on fears the death of its treasurer Charles Rice on Sunday The shares were down 14 4 per cent at $21 95 Technology was weak ahead of Intel's mid-quarter update on Thursday The world's leading chipmaker is expected to lower its second-quarter sales forecast to the lower end of its guidance Shares fell 3 8 per cent to $26 58 National Semiconductor lost 4 2 per cent to $29 42 and Micron Technology fell 5 4 per cent to $22 30 All but two Dow components closed lower Honeywell fell 4 2 per cent to $37 55 and JP Morgan Chase lost 3 6 per cent to $34 66 Toronto finished lower as the market absorbed the news of Sunday's sacking of finance minister Paul Martin from the cabinet The S&P/TSX composite index slid 0 74 per cent to end the session at 7599 54 ,2
2002-06-22, Public deficits are back to stay After a decade of fiscal retrenchment the US and European governments are once again loosening their belts while Japan continues to borrow heavily The return of twin deficits in the US the trade deficit hit a record $35 9bn £24 1bn in April will put further pressure on the dollar which yesterday hit a two-year low against the euro If there is a common trend the circumstances of each deviation from fiscal rectitude are very different In the eurozone the deterioration in public finances in 2001-02 is largely cyclical although tax cuts without matching reductions in spending have also contributed Britain meanwhile has embarked on a deliberate course of deficit spending to improve public services Japan has had little choice but to run a large deficit to try and sustain demand in its economy given the limits of monetary policy The dramatic fiscal deterioration in the US is partly cyclical But the Bush administration's 2001 tax cuts and spending increases have been more important In January 2002 the Congressional Budget Office revised down its projected 10-year surplus for 2002-11 to $1600bn $4000bn less than the prediction made only one year before To make matters worse the lower estimate still reflects the surpluses accruing to Social Security and Medicare over the next decade but ignores future liabilities The CBO also makes heroic assumptions about the reinstatement of expiring tax measures and about the level of future spending In recent months the US outlook has deteriorated The first shock has been the weakness of US Treasury revenues during the pivotal income tax return filing season Stock price falls have sharply reduced federal tax revenues from capital gains and the exercise of stock options Goldman Sachs estimates that federal receipts this year will be 6 per cent down on fiscal 2001 Future revenues will also suffer from weaker equity prices Extra spending More worrying is the rapid expansion of federal spending and the disappearance of both legislative and political constraints on discretionary expenditure There is bipartisan support for extra spending on security and little desire to cut back elsewhere when the economic recovery is far from certain Large increases in spending on defence and agricultural subsidies have been locked in Hopes that these rises would be offset by lower rises in discretionary spending look naive The surpluses of the 1990s weakened Congressional discipline And requirements to match tax cuts and spending increases with spending cuts elsewhere will soon expire Desirable deficits Federal deficits in the region of 1-1{1/2} per cent of gross domestic product are likely for much of this decade This is still far below the 3-4 per cent levels of the latter Reagan years In the short-term public deficits are certainly affordable given the relatively low debt burden of the US They are also desirable public deficits are replacing the borrowing previously undertaken by the corporate sector which has retrenched sharply during the slowdown This fiscal offset will help to cushion slower growth in the US and its impact on the rest of the world In the longer run it would be desirable for more of the adjustment to any weakness in US private demand to come from the external balance rather than the fiscal deficit A trade deficit of 4 per cent is almost certainly unsustainable The future sustainability of US public finances is also a real concern Given the funding gap in Social Security for decades to come the running of deficits over the next 10 years simply transfers the burden on to future generations Meanwhile the weak recovery in Europe means that several countries will no longer be able to balance their budgets in 2004 as promised This is hardly economically damaging in the short term What is far more worrying is that the credibility of the eurozone's fiscal rules is being strained and that longer-term fiscal health is being ignored Germany and Portugal are in danger of breaching the deficit limit of 3 per cent of GDP but have promised corrective action Jacques Chirac the French president will have to bend the rules if he is to deliver promised tax cuts and spending increases Several European countries also have structural deficits to tackle Europe now has a rigid set of fiscal constraints that are being applied flexibly in an ad hoc manner Rules are needed that explicitly take account of cyclical conditions public investment and the sustainability of debt When agreed these should be applied in a less ad hoc manner In Europe as in the US today's fiscal deficits are no cause for concern More worrying are the pressures on spending and revenues that compromise fiscal sustainability in the long run ,3

2002-06-07, The dollar slid to a fresh 16-month low against the euro yesterday following another dismal opening by US equity markets High-technology shares were hit when Merrill Lynch cut its ratings on several leading semiconductor makers including Intel Corp This overshadowed positive economic data from the US Labor Department which showed initial jobless claims falling to 383000 in the first week of June The dollar has proved relatively impervious to a flurry of stronger than expected economic figures this week including indications of faster growth in services The rise in the euro to a peak of $0 9472 also appeared to be fuelled by comments from Wim Duisenberg the president of the European Central Bank His suggestion that the inflation outlook had deteriorated led to speculation that the ECB may raise interest rates after its next rate-setting meeting on July 4 further widening the eurozone's interest rate premium over the US Paul Lambert director of currencies and fixed income at Deutsche Asset Management said it was unnecessary for analysts to scramble for a daily explanation for the dollar's fall The dollar is trading like the euro used to falling every day and not always in response to a particular piece of news he said Underlying the dollar's problems is a perception that the US lead over the rest of the world in terms of expected returns on investment is narrowing  Mr Lambert added that the correction in the dollar was likely to be a protracted process  It is becoming increasingly clear that the dollar is no longer viewed as a haven in times of uncertainty This was illustrated yesterday by the market's response to the announcement that the US would create a homeland security department Rather than seeing this as a reassuring sign of the Bush administration's commitment to national security the currency markets appear to see the move as a reminder of US vulnerability Analysts said the dollar's apparent loss of safe haven status appeared to be due to a realisation that the US could no longer shield itself from international conflicts There is now a perception that whenever the US is involved in international hot spots there is a heightened risk of internal security problems said Michael Lewis senior economist at Deutsche Bank in London Markets are now placing greater value on the military neutrality of Japan and Switzerland The dollar's ballooning current account deficit is also likely to be deterring safe-haven flows Escalating tensions in the Middle East again appeared to be weighing on the dollar yesterday after Isreali tanks shelled the offices of Yasser Arafat the Palestinian leader killing one of his intelligence officers  Leading US stocks have recently become the guiding light for the dollar While currency traders have become mistrustful of economic data fearing that even strong figures do not necessarily portend a rise in profits they have been taking their lead from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 But according to David Bloom currency economist at HSBC these large stocks may be giving a misleading impression of the economy The most important indices with their heavy weightings in telecoms and technology currently represent many of the things that have gone wrong with the US economy he said There has also been scepticism about their accounting practices  The upswing in the US economy has been better reflected he said in smaller companies Whereas the S&P 500 index is down 31 per cent from its peak the S&P 400 index of mid-cap stocks is down just 7 per cent from its high point The S&P 600 small cap index is also still trading just 7 per cent away from its peak The middle ranking US companies which did not employ so much fancy accounting appear to be doing better than the former high flyers Mr Bloom said He added however that this would be cold comfort for the dollar since attention focuses on the bellwether indices ,2
2002-06-14, Glas Cymru a not-for-profit bond-financed company established last year to buy Welsh Water has beaten most of its financial and operational targets in its first 12 months it said yesterday Nigel Annett executive director said The crucial benchmarks of interest cover and financial reserves at the end of March were both better than forecast when we raised £1 9bn in May last year  Glas which purchased the principality's water infrastructure for the assumption of £1 8bn debt has been able to cut its cost of capital because debt is cheaper than equity and it has no shareholders It has promised to return £23m of savings to customers by cutting annual household bills currently averaging £276 by about £10 a year in 2004 and by the same amount again in 2005 It is also increasing capital expenditure by £41m Glas said its new structure using long-term low-risk bonds had cut its annual financing costs by about £50m The company's first results reported earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation of £222 3m 6 per cent higher than forecast last year Mr Annett said Underlying profit before the amortisation of negative goodwill and the release of fair value provisions was £24 1m all of which will be retained in the business for the benefit of customers  Financial reserves to cover unforeseen events an important cushion for both customers and lenders also increased to £241m compared with £173m forecast at the time of the bond issue Interest payments of £104 8m were £9 7m lower than expected reflecting the lower coupons achieved on last year's bonds The fixed-rate senior bonds unwrapped are now trading at about 80 basis points above the corresponding gilt better than any other water company including Thames which is owned by RWE one of Germany and Europe's biggest utilities said Mr Annett Interest cover was also higher than forecast reflecting lower interest costs and better earnings Big price-cuts imposed two years ago by the industry regulator have prompted several other British water companies to consider reducing their cost of capital by moving to heavily debt-financed structures Only AWG owner of Anglian Water has decided to proceed Such a structure is also mooted for the successor to Railtrack AWG plans to raise about £1 5bn which will be added to existing borrowings of its regulated water subsidiary leaving it 89 per cent debt financed It will then return £400m to £600m to shareholders Mr Annett said The recent recovery in water company share prices makes it harder for the numbers to stack up to support a large bond issue The structure adopted by Glas also restricts its activities to water supply and sewage services in its own geography This might deter other water companies wishing to diversify into other activities  He said Glas had also improved its performance in customer service and quality in many cases beating regulators' targets The results show that new working arrangements involving outsourcing the management of operations to companies like United Utilities and Thames have been effective ,2
2002-04-06, A hush falls across the hundreds of people in the square in Csorna western Hungary The crowd which has treated the arriving prime minister Viktor Orban like a rock star start the election rally by singing the national anthem Many are wearing rosettes in the red white and green national colours just one of the symbols Mr Orban and Fidesz his centre-right party have appropriated It is an example of the nationalist symbolism that has provided a rallying point for the Hungarian right before elections with the first round tomorrow The tactic may yet win Mr Orban a second four-year term The last opinion polls published a week ago showed Fidesz with a lead of at least 4 percentage points over the ex-Communist Hungarian Socialist party Yet the campaign has barely discussed the most serious issues facing Hungary its European Union accession economic development and the decrepit healthcare system It has also been divisive At centre-left rallies supporters wear nooses round their necks or on their lapels in protest at recent remarks by Laszlo Kover a senior figure in Fidesz's campaign His comments were taken to mean that Hungary would be better off if the opposition hanged themselves Hungarian society is very very divided says Krisztian Szabados of Political Capital a policy research and consulting institute This division is a result of the Fidesz policies The basic question is what the swing-voters think about this campaign  Mr Orban's speech in Csorna shows the delicate balance between retaining nationalist support and not alienating those swing-voters He boasts about achievements such as opening a Hungarian-language university in Romania that chime with nationalist concerns He also hints that the Jewish-dominated opposition Free Democrats are not fully Hungarian Yet much of the speech is devoted to issues set to appeal to a wider electorate The centrepiece is a plan for Budapest to host the 2012 Summer Olympics The Olympic games for a nation are not just a matter of sport Mr Orban says The Olympic games are part of the Hungarian development plan  Fidesz's concentration on such feel-good issues has been mercilessly lampooned by the liberal Free Democrats One of their posters shows a man lying on a park bench I've been unemployed for two years it reads I have time to dream about the Olympics  The Socialists however have appeared confused The prime ministerial candidate for the party which ran a coalition government with the Free Democrats from 1994 to 1998 is Peter Medgyessy a former finance minister and banker He is a compromise candidate and not even a party member Before the outcry over Mr Kover's hanging remarks in the last opinion polls before a pre-election ban Socialist support was slipping During March the Socialists ran a very bad campaign and Fidesz were very strong says Mr Szabados The results could be decided by which small parties cross a 5 per cent threshold to enter parliament Much attention will be focused on the radical nationalist Hungarian Justice and Life party If in parliament it might support a Fidesz government Yet the decisive factor could now be public reaction to a Friday evening debate between Mr Medgyessy and Mr Orban Months of campaigning may come down to a slip of the tongue ,3

2002-06-19, Fund managers Which region of the world has the best quality earnings Wave a flag for Britain which has just ousted the US from the number one position in the monthly survey of fund managers' attitudes run by Merrill Lynch Enron Tyco et al have dealt a devastating blow to investors' faith in US accounts and UK companies and auditors are the deserved beneficiaries But that alas does not translate into a belief that UK equities are the bargain of all time The fund managers see much more value in emerging markets and in the eurozone with a negligible number thinking the UK is undervalued and a large majority thinking the US is most overvalued For what it is worth the latest survey shows a rise in the industry's confidence in stock market conditions with the recent market retreat convincing it that global equities are undervalued Some 73 per cent expect equity prices to be higher 12 months hence But a more sobering statistic in the report is that on average the fund managers expect a 6 7 per cent nominal annual rate of return from global assets over the coming decade Allow for inflation of 1-2 per cent a year and that is significantly below the long run total real return on US equities of 7 per cent seen over the past 200 years ,2
2002-06-28, Business leaders warned yesterday that Britain's economy was suffering permanent damage following news that investment fell sharply in the first three months of this year It is a familiar plaint but its very familiarity underlines the seriousness of the situation Investment by British businesses has fallen for the fifth straight quarter Investment by both manufacturers and service industries was considerably lower than a year ago with manufactur ing spending down particularly sharply From the mid-1990s until 2000 it looked as if businesses were responding finally making good the deficit in investment compared with their overseas rivals It looks now as if the pick-up in investment as a share of the economy might just have been temporary as transient as the upturn in the business cycle that provoked it although to be fair to British executives their overseas competitors have reined in investment too Some cuts in investment may simply reflect the return to plain common sense after the spending excesses of the technology boom Investment in computer software has fallen by £190m to £933m in a year and investment in hardware is down by £484m to £1576m John Llewellyn the chief global economist at Lehman Brothers says The world is working off a particularly high rate of investment particularly in telecoms which in some cases was excessive  But Dougie Peedle of the Engineering Employers' Federation insists that investment in new technology cannot be delayed indefinitely without harming companies' long-term viability Firms have some spare capacity which they can use up as orders and output come through But we haven't seen much investment in new technology recently and that could harm competitiveness  Exporters say sterling's strength against the euro which only recently began to unwind has hampered in-vestment Companies have been forced to cut margins leaving little spare cash for expensive investment projects The weak euro has also sharpened price competition in the domestic market Service businesses' net rate of return fell last year to its lowest in six years Manufacturers have been affected badly with their return falling to its worst in nine years Ian McCafferty chief economic adviser to the Confederation fo British Industry says Clearly manufacturing has been struggling with an overvalued currency for some time  Since the eurozone is British exporters' biggest market the 3p rise in euro-sterling since the spring to about £0 646 yesterday will free cash for investment But that unfortunately is nowhere near enough Large businesses want to see nothing less than a strong and firmly entrenched recovery in the global economy before they start increasing their investment Surveys from the CBI and other organisations show that manufacturers and other businesses expect demand to pick up but when it comes to big investment decisions hope of higher sales at higher margins some time in the future is not enough Mr McCafferty warns In time the rise in the euro will help profit margins and hence provide a greater opportunity to invest But it's only when we see a sustained rise in demand that we expect profitability to improve  But even sceptics about the usefulness of much of the last investment surge expect investment to pick up again Some economists even think that investment is set to grow in the long term relative to spending on labour as technology drives down the real cost of computer power and makes it seem ever better value Mr Llewellyn of Lehman Brothers concludes People have a pipeline but they're just not ready to invest yet ,2
2002-04-30, Josef Ackermann the 54-year-old Swiss banker who will take over as head of Deutsche Bank in two weeks yesterday moved to stamp his authority on Germany's biggest bank Under the banner of shareholder value Mr Ackermann plans to take an axe to Deutsche Bank's cost base and shed low margin operations in an attempt to bring more focus to the bank's motley collection of businesses The reasons are plain Mr Ackermann is concerned that Deutsche Bank's depressed share price down 30 per cent over the past 12 months makes it a takeover target More importantly perhaps a sagging share price limits his power to negotiate future business deals Two weeks ago Mr Ackermann and his newly created executive committee dominated by Deutsche Bank's London and New York investment bankers met just outside Frankfurt to put the finishing touches to a broad review of the bank's businesses They concluded that Deutsche Bank could no longer afford any sacred cows With competition for capital fierce we have to ensure it is allocated to the most profitable parts of the business said one executive The executive committee agreed that unprofitable businesses or ones incapable of delivering the returns the bank needed would be candidates for sale or closure Top of the list are passive asset management Deutsche Bank's index tracking funds with more than {XEU}170bn $153bn under management and its global custody business Both are low margin businesses heavily dependent on systems and scale Deutsche Bank acknowledges that although it is ranked number five or six in the global custody sector with {XEU}3700bn under custody it still lacks critical mass in a fast consolidating sector This is about hard decisions said one banker yesterday We have to focus on what we do best  Over the past year Deutsche Bank has sold its leasing and insurance businesses and we now have to show the market we'll do more of this he added Deutsche Bank is also thought to be gearing up to sell lossmaking units such as Banque Worms a French bank and Alex Brown a US private bank On the Mittelstand Deutsche Bank insisted it would continue to lend to the embattled mid-sized German corporate sector as long as it could generate a fair risk return But bankers said the strategy fell short of a wholehearted commitment to the Mittelstand Cutting lending to the mid-sized companies is a sensitive topic in an election year But that is what Deutsche is doing said one With lending margins at unprofitable levels Deutsche Bank is already concentrating on cross-selling higher margin investment banking services and products to bigger Mittelstand clients Smaller corporate clients will be transferred to the retail banking arm where borrowing will almost certainly become pricier It has to be said a Deutsche Bank executive Deutsche Bank also plans to revamp PCAM its struggling private clients and asset management unit by bundling the retail private and online banking into one subsidiary under a single management team It will be rebranded as Deutsche Bank reversing a strategy launched two years ago when the bank's mass market retail business was hived off into a separate unit Deutsche Bank 24 Deutsche Bank had hope to force the pace of banking consolidation in Germany but the strategy failed to attract partners in the wake of the ill-fated Deutsche-Dresdner merger in 2000 Now the plan is to build the unit into a pan-European Swiss-style private banking and asset management operation focusing on affluent customers But the first task of Mr Ackermann and his new executive remains attacking Deutsche Bank's bloated cost base a long-standing concern of international investors Yesterday he reaffirmed the bank's commitment to an annual cost-savings target of {XEU}2bn by 2003 drawn up late last year The bank has already announced a series of job cuts aimed at reducing the workforce by about 10 per cent Several thousand more are thought likely as Deutsche Bank trims costs across all businesses If all that does not help Deutsche Bank's share price Mr Ackermann has one further card to play Deutsche Bank said yesterday it would speed up the sale of stakes from its {XEU}15bn portfolio of industrial holdings The proceeds in the absence of suitable investment opportunities will be used for further share buy-backs As one Deutsche banker said We prefer to buy our own shares We believe in our restructuring story ,1
1998-04-03, Moody's Investors Service the ratings agency yesterday warned that several Australian companies faced possible downgrades or outlook reviews because of the Asian economic slowdown John Cunliffe Moody's Sydney office managing director said resource companies such as BHP were vulnerable along with lowly rated exporters companies with significant investments in the region and those involved in tourism We are monitoring rated entities in these areas very carefully at the present time he said If the situation in Asia does not improve in the near future I can see the ratings outlook for a number of Australian companies changing for the worse or even ratings being placed on review for a possible downgrade  Moody's placed ANZ the banking group on negative outlook in January while BHP is already under formal review for a possible downgrade on which a decision is expected soon Robert Prugue strategist at ANZ Securities in Sydney said weak commodities prices and falling demand from Asia had soured the outlook for resource companies around the world Australia was particularly vulnerable because of its heavy dependence on commodities exports to Asia 84 per cent of the country's coal exports went to greater Asia as well as 77 per cent of its agricultural exports However Robert Prugue cautioned against panic We are seeing severe problems in Asia but the Asian values high rate of savings education and the work ethic are still intact So although demand for imports is damped those values will ensure the region bounces back  Moody's warning came a day after Standard & Poor's the other of the big two rating agencies said that Qantas the airline was well positioned to ride out the Asian storm in spite of falling passenger numbers from the region S&P said management had reacted positively to cope with the downturn in traffic from Asia It said it expected a modest improvement in Qantas after-tax profit in 1998 largely driven by additional efficiency savings Shares in Qantas yesterday closed up 4 cents at A$2 52 while BHP fell 2 2 cents to A$15 41 ,2

2002-06-13, The results of the Financial Services Agency's FSA inspection of Mizuho the world's largest bank in terms of assets emerged yesterday and gave a disturbing glimpse into a bank that is struggling to make a success out of the three-way merger that created it Mizuho was formed from the alliance of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Fuji Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan and was officially launched under one brand name as Mizuho Bank and Mizuho Corporate Bank earlier this year The fanfare of the launch was sullied by a humiliating collapse of its computer systems during the first week leading to malfunctions at its nationwide ATM network and about 2 5m erroneous transactions According to local newspaper reports the FSA concluded that the problems were caused by a chief information officer who failed to inform the bank's management of the computer problems because he feared the launch might be delayed and so he decided to press ahead anyway The regulator is also understood to have concluded that infighting between the three constituent banks over who should take the lead in integrating the computer systems slowed the integration process and meant more attention was being paid to internal politics than to the systems These conclusions back up the widely held belief that although Mizuho may have merged in name it has struggled to unify successfully the individual identities and operations of the three banks and that internal spats over territory and responsibility remain common The disastrous introduction to the global banking community not only embarrassed the company but further undermined confidence in the Japanese banking system angering the government and triggering the FSA's decision to investigate the matter There are signs that the chief information officer is being used as a scapegoat to protect the former heads of the three banks Katsuyuki Sugita of DKB Yoshiro Yamamoto of Fuji Bank and Masao Nishimura of IBJ who were responsible for the integration process Tim Marrable banks analyst at WI Carr said In a recent article in a specialist magazine Uchiyama Ryoji IT co-ordinator in the systems department of Fuji Bank's Research Institute implicitly criticises Mizuho's CEO for claiming in a press conference that he had not even received an informal communication indicating that there were concerns about the system integration  The former presidents now appear set to retain their jobs although they will probably suffer a hefty pay cut of up to 50 per cent However they will be spared the embarrassment of having to step down in controversial circumstances The FSA summoned Terunobu Maeda Mizuho's president for a verbal dressing down which he described as harsh He told reporters The management did not appreciate the operational risks on consolidating our computer system  It is understood the FSA will next week request that Mizuho improve its management and give quarterly reports on its progress The FSA and Mizuho declined to comment yesterday ,1
2002-06-28, Food producer Geest plummeted 192 to 571p after the company said bad weather in May and June had affected salad sales As the stock price plunged to its lowest level for more than a year some dealers remembered that the executive chairman had fortuitously sold the majority of his holding only a few weeks beforehand On May 30 Mr Ian Menzies-Gow offloaded 154000 of his own shares and another 3000 on behalf of his wife The shares were sold at 780p close to the company's five-year high and 36 6 per cent above yesterday's close The disposal came shortly after the annual general meeting at which the company had said trading was in line with forecasts However yesterday Geest said full year profit would remain at 2001 levels following a 12 per cent decline in salad volume growth It said May was the coolest for five years with over double the rainfall and 20 per cent fewer sunshine hours The company said it used Met Office weather forecasts in its business planning It conceded it would therefore have been aware at the time of the disposal what the weather was likely to be in June The Met Office had predicted a changeable month The Financial Services Authority the City watchdog was aware of the share disposal and was last night weighing up whether to investigate It added without making specific comment on Geest Directors are not allowed to deal at any time if they have unpublished price sensitive information  A spokesman for Geest said Ian Menzies-Gow's share sale was instigated following his announced retirement at the AGM on the 14th May and was completed before a short-term sales issue developed into a trend which we now know may affect the summer's demand The spokesman said Mr Menzies-Gow had been advised to sell his shares before his September retirement because of changes in capital gains tax law The executive chairman had until mid-July to do so Railtrack off again Railtrack shares resumed trading at 215p about one fifth lower than 280p the price on the day it was suspended from trading in early October last year having been put into administration by the government The company's market value rose throughout the day to close at 224p But the much lower valuation of Railtrack against its previous price reflected the lack of confidence many shareholders felt about the way the government had handled the company analysts said Under an £8bn plan drafted by the government Railtrack will sell its business to state-owned company Network Rail Shareholders should receive between 245p and 255p per share from the deal which is well below the former market value of the rail operator The main question for investors is whether to sell now or wait to see if they can get the full amount at a later date said John Lawson an equity researcher at West LB If the share price moves closer to the 245p-255p range people will be more inclined to hang on  Elsewhere in the transport sector British Airways recovered some of the 11p which it lost on Wednesday Yesterday shares rose 4{1/4}p to 182p with investors beginning to feel that the travel industry may not suffer as badly as some had expected in the aftermath of September 11 Analysts said this meant BA's share price was not likely to fall much more than it had already We expect the trading environment to remain difficult at least until this autumn but there are some tentative signs from BA's more recent traffic figures that improving trends are edging nearer said Deutsche Bank's Jonathan Wober explaining an upgrade from underperform to market perform Among yesterday's big losers in the FTSE 250 was Avis Europe which lost nearly one third of its value on the back of a profits warning which it blamed on lower business travel budgets Its shares fell 54{1/4}p to 118{1/2}p Telecommunications shares were mixed the day after the WorldCom accounting fraud story hit the markets Shares that have been hit hard in the past few months bounced back quite strongly while others were stable or even lost a little one analyst said MM0{2} does well MM0{2} was among the best performers on the FTSE 100 as investors estimated that it offered the best chance of a bargain in current market conditions It is a restructuring story with some upsides and doesn't have any immediate refinancing issues one analyst said Its shares rose 3{3/4}p to 42{1/4}p Vodafone also won over investors keen on capitalising on Wednesday's troubles Its shares were up 2p to 88{1/2}p Among fixed-line operators BT gained 1p to close at 242p On the downside Cable & Wireless lost 4{3/4}p to 163{1/4}p MobileFuture the wireless internet service provider lost most of its market value on the back of a poor trading update and recognition by the company that its funding position may become untenable Its AIM-listed shares fell 2p to {3/4}p Most of the negative pressure among financial services providers came from the banking sector in spite of the fact that most banks have denied holding any risky positions in WorldCom Lloyds TSB fell 14p to 631p and HBOS was also among the sector's losers shedding 21p to 695p Egg the online bank on the FTSE 250 fell 13p to 156p Abbey National bucked the trend moving sharply up 9p to 746p West LB upgraded the stock to buy from outperform setting the target price at 1010p The analysts said the low-risk nature of Abbey National's mortgage-based portfolio was behind their recommendation An upbeat trading announcement from the Royal Bank of Scotland helped its shares trim losses which amounted to 6p RBOS shares closed at 1802p Insurance companies were generally higher after being put under pressure in recent weeks by falling equity indices Life assurers posted the strongest gains with Old Mutual gaining 2{1/4}p to 86{1/4}p and Prudential moving up 7{1/2}p to 560p Royal & Sun Alliance was also among the day's best performers rising 5p to 238p Among fund managers Man Group continued to climb after being one of the few stocks to rise on Wednesday Analysts said its funds are relatively less exposed to equity indices in the US giving it an edge over its competitors Its shares rose 49p to 1004p Pharmaceuticals were mixed with AstraZeneca falling 32p to 2660p and GlaxoSmithKline adding 43p to its share price which settled at 1396p There was little movement in the oil sector with BP moving slightly up only to end

2002-06-12, GE Capital in the latest transaction of a busy round of new financing has raised $6bn through an issue of extendable commercial notes a niche market that blends short- and long-term funding The deal marks the first time that GE Capital the financial arm of General Electric has tapped the ECN market It coincides with the pricing of another bond issue today when the company is to sell up to {XEU}4bn $3 8bn to investors as it continues to reduce its reliance on short-term funding In the past few weeks GE Capital has also raised $6bn Y200bn $1 6bn and £1 4bn $2bn in separate bond issues The company said yesterday that it had decided to issue the extendable notes because it allows us to reach a broader base of investors The issue was also part of its efforts to diversify its borrowings Bankers said the transaction met with good demand from a range of mutual funds money managers and short-term investors The ECNs are a variation on commercial paper although one banker said the investors were not necessarily CP buyers GE came under intense pressure earlier this year because of the extent of its outstanding commercial paper Since the beginning of the year the group has been tapping the financial markets through GE Capital with longer-term issues of debt and backing up its commercial paper holdings with credit lines The back-up credit lines now amount to $53bn GE has already reduced its commercial paper by $23bn this year from $117bn at the end of 2001 Its aim is to reduce the percentage of short-term debt from just under half of all borrowings to 25 to 35 per cent by the end of the year ECNs have been used as financing vehicles for the past few years but the market remains quite small The issuer is typically a company or bank with an A1/P1 short-term credit rating In total some $2bn to $4bn of notes are outstanding from corporate issuers with a further $18bn to $20bn of asset-backed issues The ECNs that GE Capital issued yesterday are of five-year duration extendable on a monthly basis Each month an investor can elect not to extend which would trigger the maturity of those notes in a year The longer an investor remains invested the higher the return In this case it ranges from 3 to 12 5 basis points over one-month Libor the benchmark short-term lending rate The issue carries GE Capital's AAA creditworthiness rating Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have put a limit of 20 per cent of an issuer's bank back-up facilities that can be issued as ECNs ,2
2002-06-13, APB Financial Group a brokerage firm that also manages $175m for wealthy investors has decided to stop charging clients for unprofitable trades Clients will pay fees on a sliding scale from 1 to 3 per cent of gains for example only if the value of their portfolio increases If they break even or lose money they pay only transaction fees on the trades their brokers make The pay-for-performance structure is an industry first according to APB's research Brokers that do not charge trading commissions usually deduct a percentage of clients' assets instead Some hedge funds charge only incentive fees 20 per cent in most cases but the majority take a percentage of assets as well By refusing to accept money for poor performance APB brokers ensure that their interests are in line with their clients' said Ed Coyle APB's president We only want to make money if we make money for our clients he said The firm had been considering the new fee structure since last year but recent allegations of misconduct at Merrill Lynch Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith Barney prompted APB to move ahead with the change This is a business model that can really help restore investors' faith in Wall Street said Jacqueline Chen director of marketing The timing couldn't be better  Steven Abernathy who launched APB in 1996 also runs a hedge fund the Abernathy Group which eschews management fees in return for a percentage of profits Therefore said Ms Chen he knows this model will work As with the hedge fund which is under the Abernathy Financial Services umbrella along with APB the firm's brokers will be able to short stocks ensuring the possibility of positive returns even in a down market Ms Chen added APB which sets a $250000 minimum on accounts currently has 300 clients It employs five brokers but hopes to expand that to 10 or 15 by 2003 This is a challenge to the best and brightest on Wall Street Ms Chen If they're good they can agree to our rules ,2

2002-04-20, Appeals by the main candidates in the French presidential election to rally voters and overcome a growing trend of abstentionism appeared to have failed as the campaign closed last night Last minute opinion polls allowed for the first time in a French presidential election showed the abstention rate averaging 30 per cent in Sunday's first round vote with 16 candidates in the field The polls also showed support for the two main candidates of the right and left President Jacques Chirac and premier Lionel Jospin gaining less than 40 per cent between them The bulk of the vote looked set to be well spread on the left and right among the other candidates As much as a third of the vote could go to candidates representing movements or parties with no parliamentary representation according to the polls Throughout the election campaign different polling organisations have highlighted the high potential abstention rate and have differed little in their percentages The previous highest abstention fate in a first round of 22 per cent was registered in 1969 Despite the biggest ever array of candidates the campaign has failed to make an impact on France's 40m voters Yesterday a Louis-Harris survey revealed 54 per cent of those asked had little or no interest in the campaign This was a drop of only 8 percentage points since the outset of campaigning in early February Furthermore 29 per cent said they would make their choice between Friday and polling day on Sunday With so many voters undecided pollsters have warned against early predictions But the main purpose of the first round is to select the two candidates with the largest share of the votes to contest the run-off on May 5 Throughout attention has centred more on the likely second round battle between Mr Chirac who is seeking a second mandate on a ticket of tougher law and order and lowering taxes and Mr Jospin pledging greater social justice But both the 69 year-old Mr Chirac and 64 year-old Mr Jospin who fought each other for the presidency in 1995 have seen their polls rating gradually slip Yesterday Mr Chirac was hovering at 19 per cent and Mr Jospin at 18 per cent losing support to the plethora of small candidates The nearest rival to have emerged is Jean-Marie Le Pen the veteran far right leader of the National Front with around 14 per cent of the vote Analysts believe if Mr Chirac leads Mr Jospin by over 4 per cent of the vote in the first round it will be hard for the outgoing premier to gain the momentum to overtake him in the run-off Mr Jospin has been weakened by a switch in support to the hard left notably three Trotskyite candidates whose backing in the second round is dubious But on the right Mr Chirac faces the challenge of having to win over hostile National Front supporters There is also a strong movement to ensure Francois Bayrou leader of the centrist UDF gains a healthy score of 8 per cent or over In this way he would be able to act as a powerful independent voice within the Chirac camp www ft com/france2002,3
2002-06-04, Europe's wireless valley received a fresh blow yesterday when Microsoft said it was closing its Mobile Internet Business Unit in Stockholm The US software company said the decision to shut the unit and cut 80 jobs was because mobile internet software was now integrated into its products However the decision was viewed in Sweden as further evidence of the deep crisis in the mobile telecom sector that clustered around Stockholm in the late 1990s Microsoft paid $100m in 1999 to buy the Swedish start-up Sendit which developed software allowing mobile users to access information on their corporate computer systems At the time Stockholm home to Ericsson the world's largest supplier of telecommunications infrastructure was the centre of Europe's mobile internet boom with enormous expectations pinned on the roll-out of mobile data services and the potential offered by third-generation mobile telephony A few months later Microsoft announced it was setting up a wide-ranging joint venture with Ericsson which on the day sent the Swedish company's shares up 12 per cent Since then the telecoms bubble has burst and the rush to use mobile data services has yet to materialise Ericsson has been forced to scale back its operations drastically and cut thousands of jobs The joint venture with Microsoft never materialised Yesterday Adam Anger lead business manager of Microsoft's Mobility Group said that despite the closure the acquisition of Sendit had been worthwhile as the company had provided Microsoft with the research and development it needed Employees affected would be offered new jobs at the company's US headquarters Mr Anger said ,2

2002-06-06, Atos Origin's move into consultancy with the {XEU}657m $620m purchase of two KPMG businesses comes two years after Cap Gemini its rival French information technology services company took over the consultancy arm of Ernst & Young another of the 'Big Five' accounting firms While the E&Y acquisition turned Cap Gemini into Europe's undisputed leader in the sector it also began a turbulent period for the group and it was forced to focus on a difficult internal reorganisation while the economy was slowing However Bernard Bourigeaud chief executive of Atos Origin insists the two deals are very different and we have probably learnt from what was done before Atos is buying two units in the UK and the Netherlands rather than a worldwide operation KPMG has undergone a major shake-up and has had to endure cost cuts Furthermore Mr Bourigeaud promises that Atos will leave its KPMG colleagues to run their side of the show KPMG has long been preparing itself for moving from a partnership structure to a corporate structure while Ernst & Young was probably not ready for the move Mr Bourigeaud says In our case there will not be any internal friction because they KPMG will lead the way  Investors and analysts yesterday gave a warm response to the deal which was also taken as a signal of confidence in an otherwise depressed sector Atos shares climbed 1 6 per cent to {XEU}61 in Paris KPMG has done the hard work and the restructuring and I don't see any major risks for Atos said Antonin Baudry analyst at ETC a French brokerage However rival consultants were less enthusiastic citing the high cost structure of KPMG's UK business average revenue per partner is one-third of that at Accenture and Cap Gemini and its lack of clout in outsourcing the one area to have weathered the downturn Rivals claimed the UK arm had missed its chance to tie up with its sister US company prompting a scramble for another buyer That desperation is reflected in the price said one former KPMG consultant Highlighting the recent downturn and the fall in valuations Atos is paying 1 1 times the sales of the two KPMG subsidiaries which compares with the 3 3 times sales paid by Cap Gemini two years ago The two businesses employ 2800 people and have combined sales of {XEU}600m Atos will derive about one-fifth of its sales from consultancy and add a portfolio of multinational customers such as Vodafone HSBC Novartis and Philip Morris The deal should also open doors for Atos in the public sector which it has so far neglected but which accounts for 17 per cent of the consulting work of KPMG in the UK and Netherlands Analysts also expressed optimism about Atos's acquisition record It was formed by the 1997 merger of two French IT services companies Sligos and Axime which were focused on services to the banking sector In 2000 Atos took over Origin the computer services arm of Philips leaving the Dutch electronics group as its largest shareholder Following the deal Philips' stake will fall to 44 9 per cent from 48 6 per cent Mr Bourigeaud has always shown very good timing in terms of acquisitions and integrating companies has never turned out to be a real problem says Patrick Legland of UBS Warburg Having spent 11 years with Deloitte & Touche Mr Bourigeaud says he is at ease with the Big Five environment which will facilitate the integration of the KPMG businesses In addition while Atos had to turn round some of its previous acquisitions it is now buying two units that are profitable and will not erode margins Atos expects to end 2002 with an operating margin of 9 5 per cent Meanwhile KPMG Consulting has an operating margin of 9 per cent in the UK and 10 per cent in the Netherlands While the deal's timing took the market by surprise Atos had long indicated it wanted a role in consultancy and stronger presence in the UK and Germany Having waived the opportunity to buy KPMG's German consultancy unit Mr Bourigeaud admitted Atos would eventually have to fill that gap in its portfolio The cautious Mr Bourigeaud however will steer clear of anything that could prove too much for Atos to swallow I really believe that it is dangerous for a company to try to move very far from its founding culture he says ,1

2002-06-21, Brazil's financial markets were battered yesterday with bond prices falling to their lowest in more than three years and the currency nearing an all-time low on mounting fears of a left-wing victory in October's election Brazilian markets were also dragged down by signs that the worsening economic crisis in Argentina was spreading to other Latin American countries Uruguay yesterday announced that it would allow its currency to float freely causing the official peso exchange rate to drop 18 per cent and prompting a sharp fall in bond prices Uruguay's currency first came under pressure in January 1999 when Brazil devalued and was hit badly early this year when Argentina dropped its decade-old peg to the dollar Like Argentina Uruguay's economy is suffering its fourth consecutive year of recession dollar gross domestic product has fallen by 17 per cent since 1998 The Brazilian central bank yesterday intervened to support its currency but the real still fell more than 3 per cent to close at R$2 80 against the dollar just off its all-time low of R$2 83 last October The country risk premium as measured by yield spreads over US treasury bonds jumped to 1594 basis points surpassing that of Nigeria By that measure only Argentine government bonds are more risky There was an element of self-fulfilling crisis in Brazilian markets said Felipe Illanes senior fixed income analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York The principal concern in Brazil is over the next government's ability to service public debt that has grown to 54 5 per cent of gross domestic product Much of it is linked to the dollar Investors were disappointed by a new opinion poll yesterday that showed Jose Serra the government presidential candidate and leading proponent of economic continuity remaining in a distant second place with 19 per cent of voter intention The poll showed Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftwing workers party falling only 1 percentage point to 38 per cent from two weeks ago Increasing investor nerves was a downgrade by Fitch the credit rating agency on Brazil's sovereign credit rating from BB-minus to B-plus Given the vulnerability of Brazil's public debt burden and balance of payments to investor sentiment and little likelihood that this sentiment will improve markedly in the coming months Brazil's sovereign credit fundamentals have taken a turn for the worse Fitch said Earlier yesterday Moody's Investors Service revised the country's ratings outlook from stable to negative The root issue is political uncertainty and until that disappears we are going to see continued pressure on financial markets said Marcelo Carvalho Brazil economist with Bank of America in Sao Paulo Uruguay floats peso Page 3 Capital markets Page 22 Currencies Page 23 www ft com/americas,2

2002-04-25, Afghanistan has begun the process of electing the emergency loya jirga the council of elders that will meet in June to pick a new interim head of state The emphasis is clearly on emergency as any one of the 21-member commission charged with planning the loya jirga can explain Province by province the overstretched commission has been sending representatives to spread the news explain the procedure and tally the result They must elect 1500-odd representatives from all of Afghanistan and even from Afghan refugee communities abroad in a little over a month We have had barely three months to adopt criteria for the voting which will satisfy everyone and to inform everyone and to implement the voting said Kasim Ahang a member of the 21-person commission appointed earlier this year by the UN which is charged with planning the loya jirga  Selecting the representatives has been done mainly by tribal custom with little oversight and virtually no international observers But this is how it has been done for centuries in Afghanistan Designed at UN-led peace talks in Bonn last December the aim of this loya jirga is to end the country's 23-year civil war Few believe that the result will be totally democratic but the main aim is to have a jirga that is broadly representative of Afghanistan's people and can elect a government that will be accepted as legitimate If this jirga even meets it will be a major victory for democracy said a western aid worker in Kabul In practice the first thing to get thrown out has been the scheduling Elections for Kabul slated for Sunday were pushed back to Monday then to next week Yesterday an election to be held in Kapisa province north of Kabul turned out to be just an information session The election will be tomorrow or maybe in a few days The process is continuing said Mr Ahang Among the tribal elders gathered at the Mosque in Gulbaha the capital of Kapisa opinions were solidly with the process We have not been able to choose our leaders for 23 years said Abdul Sabu Ghafuri an elderly townsman We absolutely support the process  Nonetheless the jirga process has its critics Burhanuddin Rabbani former president of Afghanistan has criticised the jirga procedures for discriminating against Afghanistan's Mujahideen the holy warriors who fought against the Russians and the Taliban The procedures ban participation by those who have committed war crimes which if interpreted broadly could apply to much of Afghanistan's leadership in the wake of the 23-year civil war Mr Rabbani has also charged that because the United Nations is heavily involved in the planning the jirga may be beholden to foreign governments rather than the Afghan people Sibghatullah Sanjar another commission member calls these charges rubbish You should never think that this loya jirga is rigged he said yesterday addressing the townspeople of Gulbahar It is you people who will select the representatives not by force not by money just by giving your vote ,3

2002-06-27, Ken Livingstone the mayor of London delivered a robust public rebuttal yesterday of claims that he was involved in a drunken fracas at a late night party where a guest was seriously injured In a theatrical statement to the London Assembly depicted by some as the mayor's fight for political survival Mr Livingstone denied being drunk or manhandling his pregnant girlfriend after a row over smoking and claimed he had been attacked by the man who was later injured The mayor also defended the use of the Greater London Authority's press office to issue a statement in which the man initially described the fall as an accident He denied that he his girlfriend or staff were involved in a cover-up The mayor claimed to have answered all the allegations made in a series of articles in the London Evening Standard which he accused of telling outright lies about the north London party given by the sister of Emma Beal his girlfriend Mr Livingstone repeatedly attacked Veronica Wadley the Standard's editor saying she was reckless and malicious He said the Standard was trying to bring my mayoralty to an end ruin my reputation and force me into resignation However Mr Livingstone resisted calls from members of the assembly the full-time elected body that scrutinises his office to sue the Standard for defamation or report it to the Press Complaints Commission He described the commission as toothless and said he had decided never to sue after being forced to settle an action against Private Eye for £5000 on legal advice The assembly took no vote after the hour-long session and the mayor was left waiting to see whether he will face a formal inquiry from the Local Government Standards Board The board could remove him from office if it found he had broken a code of conduct The assembly has no power to investigate the claims against Mr Living stone or to refer him to the board itself Members can refer the issue only if they have solid evidence However Trevor Phillips the assembly's Labour chairman was one of several members who urged Ms Wadley to refer the issue I wish the Standard would consider that because that would bring the whole thing out into the open everyone would have to tell what they knew there would be a body which had legal powers to requisition information and we would get to the bottom of this he said If we don't do that this is going to hang round like a bad smell for quite a long time  Lord Tope leader of the assembly's Liberal Democrat group said the Standard should put up or shut up  Eric Ollerenshaw the Conservative group leader urged Mr Livingstone to go to the Press Complaints Commission The Standard returned to the attack in late editions last night claiming that Mr Livingstone's statement was evasive and not accurate in important details The newspaper said it stood by its coverage and insisted that the mayor's statement had not changed its view However it did not respond to the challenge to refer the issue to the Standards board Ms Wadley's office would not comment The row appeared to have little impact on negotiations between Mr Livingstone and Charles Clarke chairman of the Labour party over the mayor's wish to stand as a Labour candidate in 2004 A meeting between Mr Clarke and London region Labour MPs on Tuesday night produced a shaky majority in favour of re-admitting Mr Livingstone although there was a large and vociferous minority against Less happily for the mayor a Confederation of British Industry survey of 100 London business published yesterday found that only 22 per cent thought he had delivered transport improvements in his first two years Observer Page 19,3
2002-06-11, German retail fund assets are expected to double to more than {XEU}800bn $754bn in the next five years helped by pension reforms and a growing equity culture according to Cerulli Associates the US consultancy Cerulli's projections come in spite of a disappointing performance last year when mutual fund assets fell by 1 per cent to {XEU}296bn and cross-border fund assets sourced from Germany were flat at {XEU}115bn People weren't pulling their money out of funds they just switched to real estate and money market funds said Thomas Marsh a Cerulli consultant Once people have got used to the idea of investing they don't want to go back to bank deposits  Mr Marsh says the retail market will benefit from strong demand for international fund products and the rise in internet-based distribution networks There has never been a better time for foreign funds to enter the German retail market  German banks are increasingly distributing investment products of rival financial houses As big banks focus on top foreign fund managers others would be pushed towards electronic fund supermarkets he said Last year fund supermarkets accounted for 18 per cent of net new inflows into German mutual funds Florian Gimbel,2
2002-04-02, Britain's biggest teaching union yesterday voted to escalate industrial action over classroom shortages defying government pleas for partnership The move threatens schools with a four-day week as members refuse to cover for absent colleagues The surprise vote by the National Union of Teachers threatens to derail a joint campaign by the three main unions to reduce teacher workload It casts a shadow over plans to win rank-and-file support for the creation of a super union NUT members inspired by a recent one-day strike in London decided to ballot on action which could see teachers refusing to cover for colleagues after one day's unforeseen absence and vetoing new government initiatives The London action was a great success and we need to build on it If we don't take action then who will This is our conference We should not let policy be decided by other conferences said Lorraine Hunt proposing the action As the NUT debated it was reported that the School Teachers' Review Body would suggest this month that teachers had four or five hours' guaranteed preparation time a week Government sources which will respond formally when the review body reports said It's pure speculation adding that up to three hours could be closer to the final recommendation The NUT motion which was opposed by the union's executive was passed by 116000 votes to 87000 at the annual conference in Bournemouth Earlier delegates voted to join the a campaign with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the NASUWT the second biggest teachers' union in threatening a work-to-rule in the autumn if the government failed to offer a new contract and provide the investment to implement it Tony Brockman an executive member said militant action was a huge mistake What you will achieve is the wrecking of professional unity and an end to negotiations with the government on a new contract  Nigel de Gruchy NASUWT general secretary said This certainly complicates things unhelpfully We will have to try and unravel it and get the show on the road  His union is due to back the joint action plan tomorrow Doug McAvoy NUT general secretary played down the significance of the motion and said the historic joint campaign would continue to put pressure on the government to concede a new contract and pave the way for a 35-hour week This motion is just parked until we have completed the dialogue with the government  Estelle Morris education secretary was said to be furious and disappointed that the NUT had backed the joint action  Damian Green Conservative education spokesman faced a walk-out by more than 200 delegates at the conference Many shouted disgusting when he was invited to speak He said any future Tory government would work closely with trade unions to deliver education reforms ,3

2002-06-26, Ever since President George W Bush promised a definitive statement on US policy towards peace in the Middle East raised expectations have been apparent It was hoped he would spell out a plan for a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians and then throw the full weight of his administration behind its implementation In the event Mr Bush has spelt out a vision without a road map He wants to see two states living side by side in peace and security But he does not have any new ideas about getting from here to there The good news is that Mr Bush is determined to engage in the peace process He wants the US to be involved with the European Union and the rest of the international community in building a viable and prosperous Palestinian state He knows that means Israel must halt the settlements being built on the West Bank just as Palestinian terrorist attacks must cease But for the time being he is putting all the pressure on the Palestinians to make the first concessions The US president managed to make his statement without naming Yassir Arafat the Palestinian leader But his determination to see a new and different Palestinian leadership    not compromised by terror was the overriding message he sought to convey That was the precondition for the realisation of his vision Undoubtedly Mr Arafat is a big part of the problem He has presided over a corrupt administration in the Palestinian territories He is loathed by the Israeli political leadership His own people have been growing increasingly frustrated with his failure to advance the peace process Yet he was elected president in 1996 by 88 per cent of his voters He has more popular support than most if not all of the Arab leaders in the region It is up to the Palestinian people to choose their own leaders That is democracy Mr Bush can urge them to change but he cannot dictate the outcome If new elections endorse Mr Arafat and his fellow Fatah leaders they are the people with whom peace will have to be negotiated By putting so much of the emphasis on a change in the Palestinian leadership Mr Bush is giving Ariel Sharon Israel's prime minister what he wants There is no immediate pressure on him to embark on a political process he can continue to pursue the path of military might and territorial occupation to suppress Palestinian militancy The US plan is for a Palestinian state whose borders and sovereignty will be provisional pending a final settlement Mr Bush believes that can be negotiated in three years although all the most difficult problems remain the final borders the capital and the question of ultimate sovereignty It would also mean ending the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 What is missing in all of this is a real incentive for the Palestinian people to behave as Mr Bush would wish He wants them to throw out their leaders for an uncertain future in which the viability and legitimacy of their state remain very much in question In the short term if they are to have fair elections Israel will have to withdraw from their towns In the long term they need to have a vision they can believe in On that score Mr Bush will have to do more ,3
1998-04-03, Indonesia's government has quietly pushed ahead with key legal reforms to facilitate bankruptcy and eradicate corruption in government tenders but advisers fear some of the new regulations leave loopholes big enough to render them ineffective Government officials and advisers said the cabinet last week received a draft bankruptcy law that would replace regulations dating back to 1905 which have been blamed for allowing just a handful of bankruptcies The cabinet is also considering an alternative proposal to leave the law intact but install special courts and independent receivers to replace ineffective civil courts and government agencies Banks which are owed more than $80bn by Indonesian enterprises insist on an effective bankruptcy procedure as a condition for rescheduling loans along the lines of a scheme discussed this week by the Indonesian government and the International Monetary Fund US advisers and some Indonesian officials have pushed the new draft law which would allow for a receivership similar to Chapter 11 in the US which encourages restructuring of companies They argue that enforcement of the old law would merely encourage liquidations and boost unemployment While hailing the legal reforms as significant progress government advisers also complain that one key legal improvement has been rendered ineffective by exemptions and deletions This presidential decree signed in January but not publicised regulates private investment in infrastructure projects for the first time introduces open tenders and requires feasibility studies before any state funds or resources are allocated If implemented it will lead to a much more active bidding market said Michael Horn president of the consultancy CB Indonesia which helped draft the decree The more bids you have the better price you get for the government  In theory the decree should rule out numerous investment projects set up by President Suharto's children and other well connected businesses that have been targeted by the IMF for gaining preferential treatment and draining state coffers But advisers said officials had deleted several key definitions articles and supplements from the original draft that were needed for it to work The decree leaves out bidding rules oversight a dispute settlement procedure for tender applicants as well as definitions of government support and public-private partnership One adviser said the deletions could perpetuate rent-seeking by state enterprises awarding of excessive subsidies to well connected contractors and simple rigging of tenders He added the decree was likely to be even less effective than an earlier decree on government procurement similarly weakened by exceptions and widely ignored A new ministerial decree also issued in January even exempts all state enterprises from reporting their procurement practices an exemption officials insist was a mistake but which they have yet to correct ,3
2002-06-21, It wasn't the easiest of initial public offerings but Alfa Laval the Swedish engineering group made it on to the Stockholm stock exchange last month During most of the offer period the company and its advisers fought a rearguard action against bad press and a weak stock market Indeed the offer period had to be extended and the price range cut from SKr108-SKr140 per share to the more modest SKr90-SKr95 to quell the dissenters This resulted in the offer being more than four times subscribed Yet for Industrial Kapital which reduced its holding in Alfa Laval to around 27 per cent from 60 per cent the offer's success proved that the Nordic region's largest stock market was again able to offer venture capitalists a partial exit We were ready with Alfa Laval last year says Christian Salamon a director of Industri Kapital one of Sweden's leading venture capital groups but market conditions were so unstable It may be an overstatement to describe the climate as stable today however away from the telecommunications and technology sector there does appear to be more confidence The flotation of Alfa Laval is likely to be the first of several non-technology initial public offerings IPOs to be introduced to the Stockholm market this summer Industri Kapital alone has Nobia the kitchens manufacturer and Intrum Justitia the debt collection and credit management company lined up Nor does Mr Salamon see any shortage of investment opportunities for venture capitalists that concentrate on more traditional businesses Large corporations are continuing to consolidate in Europe and in the process focusing more on core activities This means they are looking for the opportunity to sell off non-core operations that do not fit in with their strategic direction B-business Partners another large Nordic group has a very different profile yet has also been investing recently The group set up in March 2000 is focused on B2B technology mobile and wireless communications and software and services start-ups sectors that have seen their fair share of failures during the meltdown of the technology sector during the past 18 months Hans-Dieter Koch chief executive says the recent transactions prove that the market for investments is starting to open up again We were hesitant to do deals in the second third and fourth quarters of last year because when prices fall you get richer every day you wait he explains Companies are much cheaper today but it takes a lot of resources to buy Firms must hire more staff to conduct vital activities such as managing investments and conducting due diligence if they wish to maintain such a large fund he adds Since April the group has invested in third round financing of the French e-business technology group Esual Software and in AEP the Irish Internet security business With backing from some of Sweden's largest corporations B-business Partners has the resources to be patient yet in a region where so many venture capitalists sprang up on the back of the mobile boom in the late 1990s there is an expectation that many smaller ones will not survive So far the big shake-out has not materialised says Jan Sundberg chairman of the Swedish Venture Capital Association We have 145 active members compared with 150 at the height so there hasn't been any big reduction he says We have seen some headaches but not the big headaches seen in the US  He also points to the interest in the region from foreign venture capitalists perhaps the most significant being last year's purchase of Atle the listed Swedish VC group by 3i of the UK However there are those in the venture capitalist community who expect the restructuring to be more radical Ledstiernan a listed venture capitalist recently bought Speed Ventures a rival saying it believed the number of VCs in the region will eventually be reduced to as few as 20-30 more powerful companies We view this acquisition as a first step in our active participation in the coming process of consolidation of the venture capital industry explained Johan Wachtmeister Ledstiernan's president Just how painful this process will be for both the VC's and the companies seeking re-financing has yet to be seen Nicholas George,2
2002-04-16, US Treasuries built on last week's gains yesterday as the stock market sank after Citigroup became the latest corporation to disappoint on the earnings front with lower than expected profits The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen more than 100 points by midday Investors have given up on their optimistic hopes of sharp rebound in economic growth amid a weak first-quarter earnings season and as ongoing tensions in the Middle East have led to rising oil prices Recent economic data have also been mediocre The higher oil prices and poor data retail sales and consumer sentiment figures that disappointed last week are expected to give the Federal Reserve good reason to avoid raising interest rates when the Open Market Committee next meets in May Although real GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be more than 4 per cent second-quarter growth is now expected to reach only 2 7 per cent according to Bear Stearns The two-year US Treasury note had risen {1/16} to 100{9/16} to yield 3 325 per cent by midday while the 10-year note had gained {5/32} to 98 with a yield of 5 134 per cent The 30-year bond had risen {5/16} to 96{7/16} to yield 5 631 per cent Eurozone government bond prices rose as stock market weakness flat economic data and safe-haven buying due to international political uncertainty sent investors back into sovereign debt Eurozone investors are revising their expectations of a fast rise in interest rates it does not seem likely any longer said Herve' Cros a government bond strategist at BNP Paribas in London Italian industrial output fell in February by 3 per cent slightly more than expected but analysts said the data were not strong enough to damage bond investors' hopes of more sluggish economic recovery in the eurozone The two-year German schatz yield fell 5 6 basis points to 4 084 per cent while the 10-year German bund yield fell 4 4 basis points to 5 103 per cent The 10-year German bund futures contract price was up 0 32 to 106 6 UK gilt prices moved higher in thin trading as bonds tracked Treasuries and investors were cautious ahead of Wednesday's Budget The June Gilt futures price rose 0 18 to 112 15 Japanese government bonds rebounded from declines on Friday but gains were limited amid a dearth of news to drive the markets Analysts said investors were looking for cues during what is expected to be a quiet week with no major economic indicators or events scheduled However in the coming days the markets will be digesting a further downgrade in Japan's sovereign rating by Standard & Poor's which was announced yesterday when the Japanese markets were already closed Yields on the 10-year bond are expected to stay in a narrow range until the next Ministry of Finance auction on April 23 of 10-year JGBs with an expected 1 4 per cent coupon The key June 10-year JGB futures contract rose 0 27 to 138 50 and the No 237 10-year cash JGB rose 0 177 to 101 224 pushing the yield down 0 020 to 1 360 per cent ,2

2002-06-12, When a Frankfurt court opened insolvency proceedings last month into Gontard & MetallBank a small private bank it was merely the latest sign of the chronic structural problems afflicting Germany's fragmented and over-crowded banking sector Low domestic lending margins high operating costs and the large market share enjoyed by state-owned and co-operative banks have combined to ensure that the profitability of most German banks is among the lowest in Europe One obvious solution is to force the pace of consolidation According to Bundesbank data the number of credit institutions fell to just over 2700 by the end of 2000 from 3622 in 1995 But this still leaves Germany as by far the most over-banked country in the European Union Although public attention tends to focus on high-profile attempts at mergers such as the failed deal in 2000 between Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank the consolidation process is concentrated at the other end of the market primarily in the co-operative and savings bank sectors Partly as a result of pressure from the European Commission changes are gradually becoming visible at Germany's 12 Landesbanks the state-owned banks that are both regional commercial banks and house banks to the country's 16 federal states Together with the public sector savings banks the Landesbanks account for about 37 per cent of all banking business in Germany But the German government has agreed with the Commission to phase out state guarantees for the Landesbanks by 2005 a decision that seems certain to raise the banks' borrowing costs and force them to restructure themselves In March Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein otherwise known as LB Kiel announced its intention to merge next year with neighbouring Hamburgische Landesbank Stefan Jaecklin a director at Oliver Wyman & Co a financial services consultancy says the two banks are hoping to benefit from economies of scale in areas such as ship finance In 1999 Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg was formed out of a three-way merger between Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank Landesgirokasse and the commercial banking unit of Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg This example shows that consolidation in the public sector need not take the form of a plain horizontal merger between two Landesbanks Instead a Landesbank may prefer vertical consolidation that is a takeover of smaller savings banks Mr Jaecklin cautions the Landesbanks are unlikely to undergo radical change as long as there is no significant shareholder pressure something that in his view requires private owners or a public listing with freely tradable stock The consolidation trend will depend on the management of the Landesbanks having a long-term vision he says The decision of Westdeutsche Landesbank to split itself into a public sector holding company and a private commercial banking subsidiary does not address the heart of the problem because the private unit will still be 100 per cent publicly owned Germany's co-operative banks which together control about 20 per cent of the domestic banking market are also under increasing pressure to consolidate Many are too small with little automation old fashioned branches and a heavy reliance on low interest deposits There are still about 1800 of them although there are plans to reduce that number to 800 during the next few years But stepping up the pace of mergers in a sector where independence is closely guarded is not easy The difficulties were apparent last year when two of the sector's central banks which run commercial and investment banking businesses as well as settlement systems finally tied the knot after months of bitter infighting Nevertheless the creation of DZ Bank the country's sixth biggest bank represented the first significant tie-up between two German banks since 1997 when two Munich rivals linked up to form HVB Group the country's second biggest bank Peter Coym a director of Lehman Brothers in Frankfurt believes mounting competitive pressures will continue to force the pace of consolidation in the public and co-operative sectors We could even see cross sector mergers between public sector savings banks and co-operative banks in the next two to four years he says although the legal obstacles remain immense Those same pressures will almost certainly force all of Germany's banks to look closely at merging costly back office activities Earlier this year Deutsche and Dresdner agreed to join forces in the back office and bundle their payment system operations The breakthrough after years of on-off negotiations should trigger further agreements Two other Frankfurt banks Commerzbank and DZ Bank are already in talks on back office co-operation But experts say the big merger attempts that dominated headlines during the past two years are unlikely in the immediate future German banks are burdened by high costs and low profitability Their performance is poor    They have to concentrate on putting their own houses in order says Gael de Pontbriand of PricewaterhouseCoopers The big four private banks Deutsche HVB Allianz's Dresdner and Commerzbank are all focused on restructuring Rolf Breuer who stepped down as chairman of Deutsche Bank in May believes consolidation among the private banks is now a non-event too many opportunities had been missed But pressures for cross-border co-operation in Europe are mounting While more profitable UK French and Spanish banks set the pace there is a growing danger Germany's big banks will miss the boat ,1

2002-04-16, No one really expects more tax cuts this year But ardent champions of further tax reductions were out in force yesterday on the day that millions of Americans were scrambling to file their annual tax returns by the midnight deadline President George W Bush various administration officials and congressional Republicans fanned out across the country to press their case for making permanent Mr Bush's $1350bn £940bn tax cut plan passed last year Under a sunset provision necessitated by Senate budget rules it will expire in 2011 Paul O'Neill the Treasury secretary also used the annual tax-filing day to reiterate a call first made in the Bush budget for simplifying the tax code The tax code is an abomination said Mr O'Neill in a speech in Grand Rapids Michigan It is 9500 pages of confusion and complexity  Mr O'Neill proposed one small step toward simplification a single definition for a child as a qualifying dependant for tax purposes instead of the five definitions now in the code Mr Bush was travelling to Iowa yesterday where he first proposed his big tax cuts as part of his presidential election campaign Mr Bush and Mr O'Neill had hoped to have a new taxpayers' bill of rights to trumpet at their events However that legislation failed to pass the House of Representatives last week after Republican leaders tried to attach a poison pill amendment diluting campaign finance disclosure rules This Thursday the House of Representatives will vote on legislation to make last year's tax cuts permanent But it is unlikely to go anywhere in the Democrat-controlled Senate Democrats warn that the true cost of the Bush tax cuts will increase dramatically in the years after 2011 driving up deficits and wrecking fiscal discipline Some Republicans also have reservations about enacting more tax cuts at a time when the nation is facing an uncertain fiscal future and burgeoning demands on the federal Treasury as a result of the war on terrorism Some budget experts continue to believe that the nation could not afford Mr Bush's original tax cut The Brookings Institution recently concluded that new tax cuts would mean lower economic growth and higher budget deficits and warned of the danger of entrenching future claims on federal revenues The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities recently published a report noting that income tax for a family of four was at the lowest level in 44 years Nonetheless many Republicans are still pushing for new tax breaks for capital gains and expenses related to depreciation of business equipment ,3

1998-04-03, Wembley Stadium is to be sold to the English National Stadium Trust for £103m The decision by Wembley plc which owns the 75-year-old stadium had become inevitable after Arsenal Football Club withdrew its offer last week leaving the trust as the sole bidder The trust plans to knock down the antiquated stadium leaving only the twin towers and to create a national stadium at a cost of up to £240m The ground is to be the centrepiece of England's bid to host the football World Cup in 2006 Of the total spending on redevelopment £120m will come from lottery money and most of the rest from revenue from England football matches and FA Cup finals played at the stadium The trust leads a consortium consisting of the Football Association the English Sports Council the Rugby Football League and the British Athletics Federation all of which will use the national stadium The FA last month forced its partners to give it a larger say over stadium matters hinting it might otherwise consider building a dedicated football ground at King's Cross or Greenwich instead Unless Wembley's shareholders object contracts for the deal will be exchanged in June and the sale completed next year Wembley plc will continue to run the Wembley Arena and conference centre The Arsenal's bid had long been seen as a manoeuvre by the club to put pressure on Islington council to allow it to expand its Highbury Stadium Wembley shares fell 2p to 362{1/2}p yesterday ,2

2002-06-25, The story of KPNQwest would make one hell of a film says Jack McMaster the bankrupt Dutch data company's chief executive A soap opera has been the closer resemblance the unlikely twists cliff-hangers and a cast at each other's throats It has been a tale of survival as trustees and investment bankers make frantic and what may prove ultimately fruitless efforts to keep its Europe-wide 25000km data network running in the face of daily closure threats warnings and sabre rattling by those squabbling for scraps of value among the bones of the business But buried within the labyrinthine twists of this drama is a potentially more troubling tale This week a powerful banking syndicate will call for an investigation of KPNQwest's accounting practices The banks are owed {XEU}300m $293m by the company from a {XEU}525m credit facility Separately bondholders who face losses of {XEU}1 6bn are preparing to issue similar calls It is a bizarre soap opera in which the real issues have yet to come to light says Gary Klesch chairman of Klesch & Company the distressed debt specialist at the heart of the bondholders' claims The banks Citigroup ABN Amro Deutsche Bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein Fortis Barclays and BancAmerica are concerned by major discrepancies in the accounts They want to be told who knew what and when Did KPNQwest's management and its parents KPN of the Netherlands and Qwest Communications of the US know of its parlous predicament when in mid-April the company issued reduced but nonetheless still comfortable full-year results guidance Were the banks misled about the company's financial health when they agreed the credit facility that was tied to the March takeover by KPNQwest of Global TeleSytems of the US What was the relationship between KPNQwest and its parents who contributed 43 per cent of revenues or nearly {XEU}350m in 2001 KPN and Qwest challenge the amounts that KPNQwest accounts show they owe There is speculation too but again no proof that what was booked as revenues by KPNQwest amounted only to a shareholder loan from its parents Any inquiry would almost certainly require analysis of the parents' financial records given that they had consolidated their portion of the joint venture on their balance sheets The banks are also concerned that KPNQwest's key supplier Alcatel the French telecoms equipment company had not been paid since September and is said to be owed {XEU}135m Qwest which declined to comment on any aspect of the allegations has indicated it was paying $3m a month for services from its subsidiary Yet year-end figures from KPNQwest showed it contributed 29 per cent of annual revenues or about {XEU}232m A person close to Mr McMaster said that Qwest's $3m-a-month payment related to purchases of network capacity for specific customers such as Microsoft and AOL which would transmit data via KPNQwest's backbone The balance of the {XEU}232m paid in 2001 would have comprised additional capacity leased long-term by Qwest for its own use The situation was mirrored at KPN he said Jack McMaster denies anything untoward took place but he is keenly aware of the speculation I am glad we have the documents to prove it he says referring to the company's audited annual report for 2001 He says it contains a going concern statement signed by auditor Arthur Andersen But it has never been published because the auditors' opinion was overtaken by events according to the person close to Mr McMaster Meanwhile suitors are rummaging through the company's assets like customers at a car-boot sale Among 40 parties said to have expressed an interest in some or all of its operations are Interoute an alternative telecoms carrier a consortium led by Lehman Brothers Dublin-based communications group eTel AT&T of the US and Trimoteur a Dutch investment and management company Trimoteur says it may make a bid for the network as early as today but will not say how much it intends offering Two years ago KPNQwest was worth {XEU}40bn Today anyone paying even {XEU}100m would be crazy says another potential buyer And that price will fall further if the network closes and customers desert On Friday Dutch trustees Eddy Meijer and Jan van Apeldoorn failed in an attempt to get a court to force the release of funds needed to keep it running About {XEU}15m from KPNQwest's corporate clients paying bills is being held by the banks which want guarantees they will get it back from asset sales before they hand it over It was the trustees say the last throw of the dice The glass-fibre backbone upon which dozens of blue-chip customers and 40 per cent of European internet traffic relies may prove the only aspect of the soap opera that does not run and run ,1

2002-04-30, The management of Kirch-Media Kirch Gruppe's largest subsidiary which has filed for insolvency agreed yesterday to lift the veil on the business's accounts in a move to raise fresh funding Minority shareholders in KirchMedia who have offered to inject {XEU}800m $722m into the unit were allowed to start due diligence at the business's headquarters near Munich yesterday The investors have insisted on proper scrutiny ahead of any capital increase since the disclosure of hidden liabilities torpedoed earlier rescue talks a month ago They had grown perplexed over the reluctance of the new management and the court administrator to allow them a look into Kirch-Media's notoriously opaque accounts We are very satisfied an executive with one of the investors said yesterday It should take four to six weeks for the capital increase to be agreed barring any nasty surprise  One banker familiar with Kirch said The secrecy of the Kirch empire has been very damaging to the businesses and it was imperative for the new management to break with that legacy  Meanwhile Wolfgang van Betteray the insolvency expert who took over KirchMedia's management after its insolvency filing earlier this month and Michael Jaffe the court-appointed administrator are expected to appoint an investment bank as adviser this week The bank whose name could be known by Friday will seek out potential investors while the management continues to clean up its liability pile UBS Warburg and Goldman Sachs are understood to have pitched for the mandate KirchMedia's minority shareholders and other potential investors have their eyes on ProSiebenSAT 1 the 52 5 per cent-owned free-TV subsidiary of Kirch which one banker yesterday described as KirchMedia's only valuable business Axel Springer the publisher and ProSiebenSAT 1's second largest shareholder with an 11 8 per cent stake is seeking an increased stake in the business Its management will vote today on whether to file a {XEU}530m damage suit against KirchMedia The move is ostensibly aimed at enforcing payment of a put option against KirchMedia that becomes due today But Axel Springer thinks the prospect of a protracted court case could persuade Mr Betteray to swap the liability against shares in ProSiebenSAT 1 If you are Betteray and you are trying to dress up KirchMedia for potential investors you do not really want a lawsuit to hang over your head said one person close to Axel Springer ProSiebenSAT 1 which holds a 30 per cent share of the German free-TV market yesterday reported a net profit of {XEU}5 7m for the first quarter well below forecasts and 65 per cent down on the previous year's level as it continued to suffer from the weak advertising market Urs Rohner chief executive said the market was unlikely to recover before the fourth quarter ,2

2002-06-26, Josef Ackermann Deutsche Bank's new chairman will press ahead with selling its huge portfolio of industrial holdings in case a capital gains tax on disposals is reimposed after the German elections in September Mr Ackermann who formally took the helm at Germany's largest bank a month ago said Deutsche was ready to sell its stakes as it saw little hope of any turnround soon in the current market conditions Earlier this year Mr Ackermann said Deutsche would accelerate the sale of industrial assets worth up to {XEU}15bn $14 5bn as part of a restructuring drive aimed at reviving its sagging share price We cannot wait for markets to improve he said Yesterday he said We are preparing for a fairly difficult scenario  Last week Deutsche sold its remaining stake in Munich Re the world's largest reinsurer for about {XEU}1 6bn In the first quarter it booked gains of {XEU}1bn on sales of shares in Allianz the insurer and Munich Re Deutsche holds large stakes in a host of Germany's leading companies including DaimlerChrysler the carmaker tyremaker Continental insurer Allianz and Linde the energy group In his first briefing since taking over as chairman Mr Ackermann said the bank had to move fast because Germany's next government might move to reintroduce a capital gains tax on sales of corporate shareholdings I cannot rule out the possibility that a tax may come some time after September I don't want to be hit by that he said The markets would not be pleased if we failed to used this window intelligently  The abolition of capital gains tax at the start of this year was hailed by financial markets as one of the Social Democrat-led government's main achievements But the opposition headed by Edmund Stoiber the Bavarian premier has indicated it might review the reform if it wins the election Analysts believe a tax rate of 18-20 per cent on capital gains might be reintroduced Mr Ackermann said he could not rule out further job cuts at the bank as it focused on cutting its cost base and boosting profitability He said the bank would use every chance to cut costs including more use of outsourcing But further job losses on top of the 9200 already being shed could not be excluded Deutsche executives have said job losses could eventually total 12000-15000 Swiss-born Mr Ackermann said his mission was to drive up the bank's market capitalisation so it could play a role in future European or global consolidation He said the bank would focus on improving efficiency and would not be making any big strategic moves or acquisitions ,2

2002-06-03, Exchange-traded funds have seen their assets under management grow by 17 per cent to $122bn £83 5bn since the end of last year on the back of huge demand in Europe and Japan according to figures compiled by Morgan Stanley the US bank Created in 1993 in the US ETFs are based on the idea of gaining exposure to a stock index through a single tradeable share They can be used as an alternative to index-tracking funds and futures contracts Industry figures show that the US is the largest and most important market for ETFs with assets up 12 per cent at $95bn in the five months to May 24 But other markets are starting to gain ground Assets in Japanese ETFs jumped 66 per cent to $10 9bn while European assets rose 40 per cent to $7 9bn Retail investors tend to regard ETFs as a cheaper alternative to index-tracking mutual funds using them as part of a core satellite portfolio where the bulk of the assets is held in passive index trackers with the rest actively managed ETFs are also seen as a convenient short-selling tool Institutional investors are the main users of ETFs and often use them to park money as part of a trading strategy The launch of the first European ETF in 2000 triggered a wave of new products with stock exchanges and fund managers hoping to cash in on the expected rise in demand Today there are 92 European ETF products compared with 102 in the US It took the US seven years to do what Europe has done in two years said Deborah Fuhr head of ETFs at Morgan Stanley in London But some analysts say smaller European ETFs are struggling because of poor liquidity prompting investors to buy US ETFs instead Ric Lacaille head of structured products at State Street Global Advisors said growth in Europe was being held back by administrative hurdles such as the need to register funds separately in each country There is a lot of talk about European fund passports but what we need is a single financial market ,2
2002-06-04, Private affairs Geneva's private bankers have always been a cut above UBS and Credit Suisse The latter have shareholders to pay for their mistakes but would presumably scoff at the idea that keeping the family name going was more important than doing deals to boost the bottom line Nevertheless after Wall Street's Goldman Sachs and London's Cazenove had thrown in the towel as private partnerships it seemed Geneva's private bankers were the last bastions of an outdated business model That is not how it looked in Geneva where Lombard Odier and Darier Hentsch announced yesterday they were merging after 200 years apart Darier Hentsch the weaker of the two could easily have sold itself to one of a number of circling wealthy foreign predators Pierre de Weck a former UBS top honcho who heads Deutsche Bank's private banking operations is certainly on the prowl One of his relations is a Lombard Odier partner But de Weck comes from a Catholic family and Geneva's banks pride themselves on their protestant tradition So Deutsche Bank may have to content itself with a long overdue bid for Zurich's Bank Vontobel ,1
2002-06-03, Merrill Lynch Schroders and Gartmore are among a group of the world's best-known fund managers who suffered a dramatic fall in their UK pensions business last year The three fund managers once part of the so-called big four along with UBS Global Asset Management that dominated the industry in the mid-1990s saw the value of their flagship segregated pension funds plunge by a quarter or more Some of their rivals including State Street Global Advisors Legal & General and Capital International seized their opportunity to capture a slice of the UK's lucrative pensions business the biggest in Europe The findings in an FTfm survey of top UK pension fund managers suggest that the big-name investment houses are struggling to shed the bad memories of poor past performance high-profile court cases and problematic mergers Seventeen of the top 25 managers saw a slump in their segregated as opposed to their pooled pension fund business as markets tumbled and pension funds changed strategy awarding small specialist mandates to several fund managers rather than large mandates to one or two big balanced managers The biggest names continued to suffer from a lingering bad news factor Merrill Lynch Investment Managers which has suffered a net outflow of £3bn this year as well as a series of defections by top fund managers lost nearly £16bn of assets in its segregated funds falling 24 7 per cent to £47 9bn in 2001 It said a high-profile court case which ended when it paid about £70m to a former client the £4bn pension fund of Unilever the Anglo-Dutch consumer group did not contribute to its loss of business Pension fund clients and consultants very much perceive the court case as ancient history said Andrew Dyson head of MLIM's institutional marketing division They understand that we have moved on  Schroders MLIM's nearest competitor lost nearly £15bn of assets in its segregated funds falling 27 7 per cent to £38 9bn in 2001 It acknowledged that half this amount was attributable to a slump in the markets and half to client departures in the first half of 2001 when it was still struggling with investment performance Gartmore which fell out of the UK's top 10 for the first time saw its segregated fund business fall by 38 2 per cent to £14 9bn But it said this was primarily attributable to the sale of its index-tracking business which accounted for about £7bn of the £9 2bn decline UBS Global Asset Management which as Phillips & Drew saw an exodus of clients during the technology boom clung to its top five position despite a fall in segregated business of 12 2 per cent to £23 5bn Overall its funds under management rose by nearly 30 per cent to £278bn up from £215 5bn Other fund managers that suffered losses were Scottish Widows Investment Managers which saw a 34 4 per cent fall to £14 1bn as clients fled after its merger with Hill Samuel Asset Management Another casualty of M&A activity was Dresdner RCM Global Investors which saw its segregated business tumble by 51 3 per cent to £2 7bn in the year it was acquired by Allianz the German insurer Jupiter which has been put up for sale by Commerzbank its German proprietor tumbled out of the UK's top 25 pension fund managers as its segregated business fell by 30 2 per cent to £3 1bn The loss of business reflected a wider trend in the UK A report published today by UBS Global Asset Management says the value of UK company pension fund assets fell to £683 5bn their lowest for five years However some funds increased their presence in the market State Street saw its segregated business grow 145 7 per cent to £10 8bn This was in part due to its acquisition of Gartmore's index-tracking business It also reflected its performance elsewhere A survey by Pensions & Investments a US journal found that State Street was the world's largest manager of institutional assets with $766 5bn just ahead of Barclays Global Investors and Fidelity Investments Other fund managers that saw big rises were Legal & General 99 2 per cent Capital International 24 2 per cent and Morley Fund Management 23 4 per cent ,2

2002-06-04, A rebound in the US factory sector has reawakened hopes of a rise in interest rates in August leading investors to sell US Treasury bonds yesterday The Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index rose sharply in May increasing to 55 7 its highest since February 2000 from 53 9 in April The biggest improvement came from the new orders component suggesting that solid growth in manufacturing output will continue into the third quarter according to Jade Zelnik chief economist at Greenwich Capital The strong results also give the Federal Reserve leeway to increase the Federal funds rate in August Ms Zelnik said but added that any rise in rates would also depend on a faster pace of job creation and strong signs of an emerging recovery on capital spending The labour market remains weak with continuing claims for jobless benefits still high Economists also note that warnings of potential terrorist attacks and the possibility of military action against Iraq as well as the possibility of war between India and Pakistan have made financial markets nervous perhaps making the Fed cautious about increasing rates The 10-year US Treasury note had lost {3/16} to 98{15/32} yielding 5 072 at midday while the 30-year bond was down {3/8} to 96{5/32} to yield 5 646 per cent The two-year note was down {1/32} to 100{1/32} with a yield of 3 219 per cent Eurozone short-date bond prices fell in line with US Treasuries following strong manufacturing data in the US and higher than expected inflation data But trading volumes remained low as London markets stayed closed for a public holiday The yield on the two-year German schatz bond rose 1 8 basis points to 4 235 per cent However the yield on the 10-year German bund fell 1 6 basis points to 5 170 per cent The 10-year bund future rose 0 30 to 105 76 The market's attention is focused on this week's meeting of the European Central Bank which will decide the future of the interest rates in the eurozone Positive economic data last month convinced most market participants that the ECB will raise the base interest rate at some point over the summer but few expect to see an increase this Thursday Japanese government bonds rose on bargain-hunting yesterday shrugging off any lingering effects from the two-notch downgrade Japan suffered on Friday at the hands of Moody's Investors Service JGBs prices also were supported by position adjustments ahead of the expiry on June 11 of the June futures contract However market gains were limited by caution ahead of Thursday's auction of five-year government paper and Friday's release of first-quarter gross domestic product figures The GDP data are expected to show that Japan recovered from three successive quarters of contraction between January and March The market is also looking ahead to the Bank of Japan's two-day policy meeting from Tuesday June 11 The central bank has upgraded its assessment of the economy and may do so again amid signs the economy is heading for a cyclical recovery The benchmark No 239 10-year cash JGB rose 0 044 to 100 176 pushing the yield down 0 005 to 1 380 per cent June 10-year futures ended 0 09 higher at 139 10 Moody's downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating to A2 from Aa3 with a stable outlook The decision had little impact on the market as Moody's had warned of a rating cut three months earlier ,2
2002-06-24, When Germany's ruling Social Democrat coalition introduced radical pension reforms at the beginning of this year they were expected to herald a bonanza for the financial services industry as Germans rushed to save for their old age Financial analysts held out the prospect of a German savings market that would grow by a mouth-watering {XEU}20bn-{XEU}40bn £13bn-£26bn over the next five years But six months on barely 6 per cent of the 35m Germans entitled to take out a private pension product have done so Only 1 9m policies have been sold although the government says several million more people are set to sign up for corporate schemes Banks insurers and other providers have been putting a brave face on the figures But their initial euphoria is rapidly giving way to disenchantment Allianz the giant insurer and Deutsche Bank are among Germany's elite financial institutions that have publicly criticised the reforms The common view is that the Riester pension products named after Walter Riester the labour minister who piloted the reforms through parliament are too complicated The law is so perfect that no one really understands it says one Frankfurt-based banker It is a typically over-engineered German product  To add to the gloom consumer groups have strongly advised the public faced with as many as 3500 different products to take their time before taking the plunge That advice is echoed by the government's own promotional brochures There is little opposition to the principle of reform It has been hailed as an epoch-making first step But the Riester reforms have been seen by many as a cautious stop-gap solution aimed at bolstering a creaking pay-as-you-earn retirement system that is unable to bear the strain of a rapidly greying population Like most other European countries Germany funds retirement benefits by taxing current workers But with people living longer and having fewer children the all-important ratio of workers to dependents is calculated to double over the next 48 years By 2050 there will be two workers for every senior citizen compared with four workers at the moment In such circumstances the level of taxation required to sustain such a system would be unaffordable say pension experts The only solution is to encourage individuals to save for their retirement in individual or group plans by offering subsidies or tax benefits The Riester reforms set out to do just that Starting this year Germans have been able to put up to 4 per cent of their income into state-subsidised retirement schemes either individual Riester products or occupational plans offered by their employer But the financial incentives say critics have not been significant enough It will take more than this to break five decades of reliance on social security says a Frankfurt fund manager Already there is talk of making the schemes compulsory if the voluntary system fails to attract a sufficient number of savers Last week Udo Behrenwaldt head of Deutsche Asset Management's European operation said If behaviour can't be changed then maybe to make the whole system work one would need to make it compulsory  Joachim Faber Allianz's head of fund management has made similar comments This would be politically sensitive But there may be no alternative Recent polls show that more than 70 per cent of Germans are not interested in pension plans Dirk Fach of PwC Consulting says the main problem is that there are lots of rival equity-based products that provide better investment returns A Riester product comes with a money back insurance-style guarantee that by costing more has a negative impact on the returns to the saver But he is optimistic the market will develop A PwC survey of providers shows that most of them expect corporate or occupational schemes to account for two-thirds of the pension market over time The government estimates that 60m workers could join such company schemes Mr Fach says Providers are beginning to focus on corporate schemes If they can't reach the public directly through Riester products they will try it through employers  Under the pension legislation companies have to offer occupational schemes to employees At present most small- and medium-sized businesses the backbone of the German economy do not offer membership of a company pension scheme The potential is there and the pressure on individuals to save for retirement will only get higher The government is already gradually reducing pension benefits and it is widely expected to cut them further as budgetary difficulties mount Mr Fach says I think people have to get used to the idea of saving for retirement Funded pensions are the only way forward ,3

2002-06-29, Just when telecommunications operators thought things could not get any worse they have This week WorldCom one of the most acquisitive telecoms operators of the 1990s boom revealed that it had used highly questionable accounting techniques to inflate its earnings The revelation has prompted the US government's financial services committee to issue subpoenas to the current and former chief executives of the international carrier as well as Jack Grubman the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who has been criticised for being too close to the company The move follows growing fears among analysts and investors that more accounting irregularities could be lurking in WorldCom's books WorldCom announced this week that it had booked $3 8bn £2 6bn of operating expenses as capital expenditure So instead of writing off ongoing costs as they occurred by redefining costs such as employee expenses WorldCom was able to spread the bill over a number of years This had the effect of boosting its earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation a much-coveted measure of financial performance The alleged fraud has triggered a crisis of confidence in all global telecoms operators Analysts said that they were poring over the accounts of UK telecoms operators looking for similar irregularities and accountants reported a wave of calls from non-executive directors of European telecoms operators requesting a formal review of their own accounting practices There are a lot of non-executive directors running scared confessed a telecoms accountant at a big accountancy firm WorldCom's admissions have sparked outrage in the US But the practice of booking some employee costs as capital expenditure is deemed legitimate for many telecoms operators The key difference in WorldCom's case was the scale of costs it was seeking to pass off as capex which was seen as a blatant attempt by the company dramatically to flatter its earnings According to Goldman Sachs the $3 8bn of operating expenses that the company had sought to brush off as capex meant that operating expenses had actually accounted for 39 per cent of its total capex bill much higher than rival operators By contrast last year at BT Group and Cable and Wireless operating expenses such as employee costs accounted for 15 per cent of capex Analysts said the figures at most UK telecoms operators appeared reasonable Many had substantial one-off wage costs for building out their networks which analysts said was a legitimate capex charge But they said that developments at WorldCom were highlighting all aggressive accounting techniques even where these are allowable under UK accounting rules The whole area of accounting in the telecoms industry has a series of judgmental issues so there is the potential for management to step over the line said one telecoms accountant We are definitely focusing attention more closely on aggressive accounting and there is an increasing awareness among analysts that they have to look more closely at this area  In the US the now bankrupt carrier Global Crossing is the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting treatment of long-term capacity sales known as IRUs The investigation centres on how the carrier may have engaged in so-called hollow swaps illegal capacity sale transactions without any commercial benefit purely to boost its revenues Many telecoms operators buy and sell capacity from rivals to fill in gaps in their network coverage Under US accounting rules operators are not allowed to recognise capacity sales as revenue in the year that they are sold but must spread the revenue over the number of years of the lease However under UK rules all revenue can be booked immediately even though capacity leases can run for 20 years Some analysts have suggested this practice has encouraged operators to engage in capacity sales purely to flatter revenues In the last financial year Cable and Wireless booked £229m of capacity sales as revenue although the company has repeatedly insisted that all such sales have a commercial purpose To comply with separate US accounting rules it strips out capacity sales from its revenue line But a crackdown on accounting for capacity sales and swaps with other carriers is possible following an investigation into capacity swaps by the Accounting Standards Board Britain's main accounting rulemaker Accountants also point to the possibility of further aggressive accounting with the arrival of third generation data services Mobile operators are likely to reach revenue sharing agreements with third parties to provide interesting content for consumers But some accountants have warned that mobile operators desperate to generate growing revenues from data services may seek to book the entire amount spent by users rather than the actual amount generated by their revenue sharing agreements At the height of the internet boom dotcom companies adopted a similar technique known as internet bartering Here they swapped advertising space with rivals at no cost but booked the transaction as revenue to flatter their business models However despite the closer scrutiny of more aggressive accounting practices the overwhelming mood in the UK is that accounting fraud is less likely in Britain given the tougher corporate governance standards David Gould investment director at the National Association of Pension Funds points out that only a tiny number of individuals at FTSE 350 companies occupy the position of both chief executive and chairman By contrast Bernie Ebbers the founder of WorldCom had previously held the positions of chairman chief executive officer and head of the company's audit committee Pierre Danon chief executive of BT Retail BT Group's fixed line business agrees Having worked in the UK and spent three years working in the US there is no doubt that the US has a lot to learn about corporate governance from the UK he says But there are concerns over remuneration and bonus packages in the UK which some argue could provide senior executives with incentives to engage in creative accounting While shareholders welcome the UK's greater focus on performance-related pay there are worries that some performance hurdles particularly those tied to ebitda could encourage more aggressive accounting This is a concern says Mr Gould In the US it is very unusual to have a performance link to remuneration at all  Analysts and investors reported that there had been a flight to quality this week in the wake of WorldCom as investors sought out telecoms operators renowned for transparent accounting Immediately following WorldCom's announcement shares in all telecoms companies tumbled But as investors digested the implications most UK telecoms stocks rallied The main exception was C&W following the publication of a report into aggressive accounting practices of the telecoms operator by the Center for Financial Research a US-based accounting research organisation Immediate concerns about an accounting scandal in the UK appear to have receded for the time being But WorldCom has had a huge impact on investor confidence weakening the ability of investors to withstand further negative news The market seems to view this as a one-off rather than a widespread problem said Paul Sharma analyst at JP Morgan Chase But this is a bear market and if any more problems arise stocks will be severely hit  In the weeks to come telecoms operators can therefore expect much closer scrutiny not only on accounting practices but on pay and incentive schemes as investors seek to spot the next problem before everyone else ,1
2002-04-30, Here we go again Two years on from the last election and still America's elderly are paying for their prescription drugs despite universal agreement from both political parties and the drug companies that there should be some federal help Under Bill Clinton Medicare the system of federal healthcare aid for the elderly looked as if it might be expanded to cover prescription drugs administered outside hospitals But disagreements over the scope management and cost of the scheme meant that did not happen even in the last election year of 2000 Now under President George W Bush and with more polls on the way in November it is once again an election topic The difference is that the hot debate is this time so much hot air there is almost no chance of anything happening The House of Representatives with its Republican leadership has once again set aside money in its budget for a Medicare drug benefit It is $350bn over 10 years and starts in 2004 It will be administered by the private sector The Senate led by Democrats wants to set aside $500bn Influential Democratic senators among them Edward Kennedy want the government to run the benefit Mr Bush's own plan costs about $300bn The White House will be making as much political capital as it can out of the Senate's wish to outspend him Analysts see no chance of the differences being reconciled especially with the nation's finances in a far less healthy state than they were two years ago For the pharmaceutical companies despite their rhetoric in favour of a drug benefit for the elderly the lack of concrete action in Washington is good news The US is the world's largest market for prescription drugs accounting for more than 50 per cent of sales It is the only market of any size where the companies are largely free to set prices as they see fit They view this as essential for the high costs of research and development and the reason why the US has become the dominant pharmaceutical country It is why companies such as Pharmacia have relocated to the US and why GlaxoSmithKline's Philadelphia offices are becoming the power centre of the global group The drug companies agree that the elderly should have access to prescription drug funding Of course any curbs on pricing would not be on the scale they experience in Europe and Japan so the US's standing is not in threat Moreover any industry executive will admit privately that the longer it takes for any bill to be passed the better But the companies are sensitive to criticism on price and there has been plenty There is no doubt in my mind that there is a lot of pressure on these companies to set prices in a friendlier way than they have says Joan Woodward analyst at Goldman Sachs Busloads of pensioners have been crossing the Canadian border in search of cheaper drugs Insurance companies have been petitioning regulators to make allergy drugs available over the counter and therefore cheaper Consumer groups say drug companies spend millions enticing patients to their newest and most expensive drugs eroding the doctor/patient relationship when older medicines might be just as appropriate Drug companies are under fire for spuriously surrounding their drugs with walls of patents that collapse under legal challenge Critically ill patients in the Third World say they cannot gain access to the medicines they need At least one generic manufacturer Watson is changing its strategy because it is too hard predicting when it can launch generic products in the face of the legal onslaught Watson is trying to find more of its own drugs now The big pharmaceutical groups have been responding with some ideas of their own Pfizer and Eli Lilly were among the first to announce schemes to help poor elderly Americans Recently Abbott Labs Aventis Bristol-Myers Squibb GlaxoSmithKline Johnson & Johnson AstraZeneca and Novartis announced their own combined effort Pfizer the world's largest drugs group says the average US retail price of a brand-name drug prescription is almost $70 Its Share Card allows the elderly 30 days of any of the company's drugs for $15 President Bush's own plan for a discount card however which relies on industry to cut costs without any federal money is stalled in the courts challenged by the nation's pharmacies Meanwhile individual US states facing spiralling healthcare costs are continuing their own efforts to cut costs of Medicaid the assistance programme for the poor The industry has successfully fought off a move by Michigan to limit severely which drugs it will cover under Medicaid But in Florida some companies have pledged assistance and given meaningful concessions Some of those schemes the discount cards and the pressure from insurers all amount to some measure of price control But there is no need for anyone to hold their breath for more Other than the public relations attacks nothing onerous has happened to these companies yet says Ms Woodward ,3
1998-04-03, Skoda Plzen the Czech Republic's biggest engineering company shook the Czech stock market yesterday when its shares fell by 7 6 per cent after it reported preliminary consolidated net losses of Kc1 8bn $53m for 1997 The result marks the company's third consecutive year of consolidated net losses and Skoda's share price fell from Kc490 to Kc453 In 1996 the group suffered a consolidated loss of Kc2 2bn and in 1995 its consolidated loss was Kc431m Lubomir Soudek Skoda's chairman and biggest shareholder with 21 5 per cent has previously failed to deliver on his forecast that Skoda would soon become profitable He had forecast profits of Kc600m for 1996 and last autumn his company said it was expecting to turn in a consolidated net profit of some Kc200m for 1997 Skoda said yesterday it expected to post a consolidated gross profit of up to Kc900m for 1998 but analysts were not convinced There is never any good news from Skoda Plzen said Martin Vojta an equity analyst with Patria Finance in Prague Skoda Plzen now does not look able to improve its shape or its performance it has too many loss-making businesses and does not seem able to concentrate on its profitable ones  Mr Vojta said Skoda's consolidated operating loss of Kc800m was especially bad In 1996 the company reported operating losses of Kc1 24bn Skoda has nearly 60 divisions and subsidiaries many of which made big losses last year Its truck-making division Liaz lost Kc520m in 1997 against a loss of Kc380m the previous year The company's German metal-pressing subsidiary Umformtechnik lost Kc250m about the same as in 1996 Vladimir Kadlec engineering analyst at Expandia a Prague brokerage noted that even Skoda's so-called blue chip divisions now look as if they are struggling Revenues at its turbine-making subsidiary Skoda Turbiny fell from some Kc3bn in 1996 to about Kc1 4bn last year Mr Kadlec also pointed to Skoda's apparent inability to consistently meet its own sales forecasts Total sales in 1997 were a preliminary Kc23 5bn the same level as in 1996 and far short of Mr Saudek's sales forecast of Kc32bn Mr Kadlec said he expected Skoda shares to reach Kc400 or less in coming days Skoda Plzen is not related to Skoda Auto the carmaker in which Germany's Volkswagen has a 70 per cent stake ,2
2002-04-10, When the Berlin Congress Centre opens its gates today it will face a tide of thousands of angry DaimlerChrysler shareholders At this year's annual general meeting small shareholders and their associations are threatening to vent their anger over last year's steep dividend cut sky-high losses at Chrysler and Freightliner and the premature extension of the contract for Jurgen Schrempp chief executive until 2005 In an unusual twist Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda investment group DaimlerChrysler's third-largest shareholder may lend firepower to disgruntled minorities Mr Kerkorian sued DaimlerChrysler in late 2000 for $8bn in compensation arguing he was misled about the true nature of the merger between Chrysler and Daimler-Benz in 1998 We will attend the AGM But we have not yet decided whether we will ask questions or place counter-motions said a lawyer close to Tracinda The group owns just under 1 per cent in DaimlerChrysler after selling the bulk of its shares after the merger The merger with Chrysler is expected to top the agenda of shareholders' complaints In 2000 Chrysler's car business alone posted {XEU}5 4bn $4 7bn in losses including restructuring costs Freightliner its US trucks unit burdened the group with a loss of {XEU}514m DaimlerChrysler was forced to cut its dividend to {XEU}1 from {XEU}2 35 Mr Schrempp is expected to reject such complaints He will reiterate his belief that only a truly global car company can be successful in the long run With all its brands the DaimlerChrysler group is globally well balanced and therefore far more stable than other companies he said in an interview this week The chief executive also said he planned to buy a majority in Mitsubishi Motors once it became profitable and substantially reduced its {XEU}13bn debt DaimlerChrysler owns 37 per cent in the Japanese carmaker and has the right to buy more shares from autumn 2003 Mr Schrempp still clings to his failed idea of a world company said Jorg Pluta who represents DSW the association for the protection of shareholders Mr Pluta is particularly furious about the cryptic wording of a profit warning in February In it DaimlerChrysler cut its profit goal for 2002 by more than half substantially backtracking on an earlier outlook Mr Pluta is calling on investors to withhold their vote of confidence for Mr Schrempp and his management We should make sure that the milestones become stumbling blocks he says However according to an internal DaimlerChrysler estimate small shareholder associations represent about 0 05 per cent of the group's capital This compares with about 55 per cent for institutional investors Deutsche Bank and the Kuwait Investment Authority own 12 per cent and 7 per cent respectively Ahead of the meeting KIA the secretive investment fund for the Gulf country has reaffirmed its support for the management So despite the noise made by small shareholders institutions whose voting power far outweighs them will probably reject all the counter-motions and vote for the management The small shareholders will not leave empty-handed They will return home with stomachs full of sausages and beer and plastic bags filled with brochures and little presents Additional reporting by Guido Reinking www ft com/daimler,1
2002-06-14, J M Barrie maintained that there was nothing more frightening than a Scotsman on the make The profession that he loved did the cannily moist-eyed purveyor of whimsy for adults proud in Rosalind  a recent Radio 4 drama starring Dame Judi Dench Celia Imrie and reading Barrie's stage directions Bill Paterson This much-heralded touch showed that Barrie's directions were less prolix than Shaw's but also less revealing One merely wanted to shout Get on with it! to the radio Described by Radio Times as poignant the one-acter turned out to be a pawky vehicle for the Dame playing a famously glamorous actress in reality a comfortably middle-aged woman who off-stage passes herself off as the actress's mother for the sake of an undisturbed private life The whole thing was a tribute to the business like which we are always assured there is no other Barrie sprang to mind in last Saturday's Talking Politics when Sheena McDonald presented a discussion on Scottish devolution and showed how fascinating such programmes can be when peopled by the civilised and informed with no axes to grind or soap-boxes to mount and nary a shoulder bearing the slightest hint of a chip Kirsty Milne pointed out that the predicted anti-Scots backlash among the English has not materialised perhaps through ignorance she added graciously though recent researches show that the English dislike the Scots far less than the reverse Perhaps the English are just less rancorous than the Celts As one bland pundit put it the British taxpayer pays for Scots social benefits a canny wheeze that Barrie would have liked And a backlash has apparently started though the deprived north of England historically tends to identify with the Scots in terms of unfair distribution of wealth Intriguing predictions included the monarchy a century from now that slipped in surprisingly easily presiding over English Welsh and Scots parliaments and constitutional crises sparked by pro-Europe Wales and Scotland opposed by England anti as always Chairing the whole thing with her undeniably Caledonian accent the splendidly efficient McDonald claimed neutral status as an English resident And firmly declined to cheer for any football team I don't speak football  Football like the poor is still with us as is the jubilee Radio 4 putting into practice its theory of how to celebrate anniversaries of non-political institutions by assembling unopposed republicans for a bitching session in Broadcasting House and discussion programmes on whether the monarchy can survive Squeezing into the royal broadcasting category was Geoffrey Palmer's delightful reading of Henry and Mary Ponsonby  William M Kuhn's life of Queen Victoria's private secretary more proof that Britain's most rigidly formal institutions have survived through a leavening of eccentricity that would never be permitted by Habsburgs the White House or one suspects a republican House of Commons Mrs Ponsonby was a crack shot who roughed it with Canadian loggers A dab hand with the blow-torch she loved pottering in her carpentry workshop Her husband emerging dusty and white from a chalky trench in the Crimean war recorded how his fellow officers compared his appearance with the Commendatore in Don Giovanni  The ruling classes had an unabashed range of cultural reference in those days An interesting sidelight was the sneering Whiggish nicknames for the Queen and Prince Regent Joseph and Eliza the equivalent of a later century's Keith and Brenda Even more interesting was poor Ponsonby's behaviour during a stroke when gazing at his regal employer he murmured What a funny little old woman you are!

2002-06-03, As a classically educated Italian Mario Monti should be familiar with the ancient myth of Pandora's box And yet the European competition commissioner seems to have disregarded the experience of the woman whose curiosity has become legendary His decision last December to ask for comments on radical plans to overhaul the way European regulators scrutinise mergers and acquisitions has unleashed a barrage of responses European Commission officials express amazement at the large number of submissions more than 120 received from companies national governments and campaigning organisations since Mr Monti launched his consultation document or green paper They should not be so surprised Merger scrutiny arises strong passions inside and outside the European Union as shown by the bitter disputes over the Commission's vetoes of the General Electric-Honeywell deal and the all-French tie-up between electrical groups Schneider and Legrand It is only natural that Mr Monti's proposed reforms the first radical change of European merger rules since their introduction 12 years ago should release a lot of pent-up suggestions and emotions With Mr Monti due to outline the first results of the consultation in a speech tomorrow ahead of a formal proposal before the end of the year the Financial Times has taken a look at some of the responses that landed on his desk Despite the fact that Mr Monti specifically asked for comments on the merger rules many respondents focused on the wider subject of the Commission's sweeping powers Several submissions especially those from businesses criticise the current system for giving too much power to the Commission without adequate external control According to Unice the European employers' federation One of the greatest shortcomings of the merger regulation    is the lack of due process and proper checks and balances in the system  Unice's position shared by most of the businesses that submitted responses is that the Commission should not act as judge and jury by carrying out investigations into mergers and also making the final ruling on them The fact that the European Court of Justice the supreme arbiter on competition matters can take up to five years to judge an appeal to a Commission's decision is the main cause of the problem in Unice's view The current system of judicial review of merger decisions is unsatisfactory and in-effective The length of the proceedings clearly discourages and frustrates litigation Unice wrote to Mr Monti The commissioner usually dismisses such arguments by saying that it is beyond his powers and beyond the scope of the green paper to change the way the ECJ works He also points out that the Luxembourg-based court has recently introduced a so-called fast-track system to review some merger decisions in as little as eight months Some of the respondents do not buy this line however Many business representatives believe the current checks and balances could be strengthened without overhauling the inner workings of the ECJ The most radical proposal in this respect comes from the UK government London's Department of Trade and Industry wants Mr Monti to split the Commission's merger department in two to introduce stronger safeguards for companies According to the DTI each merger should be analysed by two separate groups from the Merger Task Force the team of 60 lawyers and economists that investigates mergers Under the current system one taskforce team usually four or five people analyses a merger throughout the entire process which can take up to five months The UK government would like one team to carry out the preliminary month-long investigation If it found serious competition problems the merger should be handed to a second team for the four-month in-depth inquiry that leads to a blocking or clearance The DTI says that this system would be the most straightforward way of introducing a'second pair of eyes' into the system Other business groups favour a less radical solution The two submissions by the Brussels-based American Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry both urge Mr Monti to strengthen the role of the hearing officer At present this official's main task is to ensure correct procedures are respected throughout the process This involves acting as an impartial referee during the oral hearing the showdown between the companies the Commission and anyone with a complaint about the merger under review The American Chamber of Commerce would like the officer to be made totally independent and be given more resources and more powers to judge on substance as well as procedures This the US organisation argues would create a powerful internal counterbalance to the Commission during the inquiry and when the decision is made The second main point of disagreement is about the key criterion used by the Commission to determine whether a merger is anti-competitive At present the Commission applies the dominance test deciding whether to block a merger by examining whether it would create or strengthen a company's dominant position in one market The US uses a different measure mergers should be blocked if they lead to a substantial lessening of competition in one market The difference does not appear to be large although legal experts say the US test is more flexible and could be used to block more mergers It could also be useful to have the world's two main antitrust authorities singing from the same hymn sheet Not surprisingly US businesses with half an eye on their legal costs press Mr Monti to look to the US The DTI which uses the US test is also in favour Not so the German competition authorities In a terse comment on this point the Bundeskartellamt says There are no convincing reasons for changing the prohibition criterion  Their view shared by other national regulators within Europe is that a switch would wipe out more than a decade of legal rulings on the dominance test creating huge uncertainties for companies Mr Monti has an open mind on the issue because he believes that the difference is not in the test but in the way the US and EU authorities apply it A possible compromise has been put forward by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer one of the largest competition law firms In a veiled criticism of the Commission Freshfields suggests that instead of moving to the US test the EU authorities should provide more detailed guidance on how they interpret the current one to avoid misunderstandings and surprising decisions There is more of a consensus among respondents on Mr Monti's proposals to allow companies to stop the clock for up to 15 days during both the preliminary and in-depth inquiry Most business respondents agree that extra time could help companies think about disposals and concessions to meet the Commission's concerns The commissioner however is facing a scrap on his proposals to streamline the system to allocate merger inquiries between Brussels and national authorities Mr Monti would like to do away with the current complex turnover thresholds and go for a simple three strikes and you are in system if a merger needs to be scrutinised by three national regulators it will go to Brussels This could save companies time and money but many national regulators are not impressed They fear an erosion of their powers with Brussels scooping up all the big cases The German regulators are among those who warn the Commission not to tamper with the system The procedure proposed by the Commission only seems to be simple and unbureaucratic at first sight In practice it will    make effective legal protection more difficult their submission argues Comments such as this highlight the magnitude of Mr Monti's task Whatever he decides in the next few months he is bound to disappoint at least a part of the varied competition world ,1

2002-06-05, The Budapest Stock Exchange said yesterday that in view of investor interest and the new Socialist-led Hungarian government's pro-market policies it would launch a roadshow to London and New York this month to refocus international attention on its undervalued equities There is an improving world macroeconomic environment and the new government has a much more positive attitude to the capital market said Zsolt Horvath chief executive of the Budapest bourse The BSE is in a decisive phase of reorganising into a shareholder company and we want to be more active communicating to investors both international and domestic who have been inquiring about the changes  The BSE which was one of the leading emerging markets from 1996 to 1998 has largely languished on the sidelines for the past four years depressed partly by world sentiment but also shunned by the nominally centre-right Fidesz-led coalition under prime minister Viktor Orban Csaba Laszlo the newly appointed Hungarian finance minister who will be part of the campaign team said the new government wanted the BSE to be a channel to redirect savings efficiently back into the working economy Mr Laszlo plans a package of measures to boost the bourse including the withdrawal of capital gains tax on stock profits which equity investors have long complained was discriminatory and an increase in employee contributions to mandatory pension funds from 2003 The government also plans more privatisations through the BSE and financial support for private companies making public offerings ,3
2002-06-01, Shares in GlaxoSmithKline tumbled to a four-year low yesterday as speculation revived that it would merge with Bristol Myers-Squibb of the US Analysts said the market was not ready for another merger so soon after one that had failed to deliver the hoped-for benefits Executives from GSK created from the merger of Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham 18 months ago were reported to have held exploratory merger talks with BMS last week Neither company would confirm talks although people close to events played down their significance stressing they had been no more advanced than the informal discussions BMS had held with most other big pharmaceutical companies All of the Big Pharma companies have run a slide rule over BMS said one That would normally extend to informal talks We talk to companies all the time  GSK shares fell 33p to £14 04 The decline followed last week's sharp sell-off when the company lost a court case on US patents that had protected Augmentin its blockbuster antibiotic from competition BMS has been considered a bid target for several months following a catalogue of bad news that has driven its shares 50 per cent lower since last October Analysts said GSK would find a quick fix to some of its problems if it stumped up the $60bn-$80bn £41bn-£55bn necessary to buy BMS Jonathan de Pass at Evaluate the pharmaceuticals analyst boutique said BMS would plug weaknesses in GSK's cardiovascular and oncology range  But the biggest benefit would be the cost savings that combining two big groups would generate When Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham came together they pledged £750m of net synergies over three years but achieved that figure in the first 12 months A similar shot in the arm would be useful now that GSK's earnings growth thanks to lost patents and a meagre flow of new drugs risks sliding to a fraction of recent levels Nevertheless many believe GSK should not be tempted by such short-term considerations Sir Richard Sykes architect of the merger that created GSK and chairman of the group until March told the Financial Times last week that the group should concentrate on internal research and development Most analysts agree A merger with BMS is just a cost-cutting story What GSK needs is a pipeline of development products and for that it needs to buckle down for a long hard slog said James Millett at Nomura GSK's official line suggests such words do not fall on deaf ears Jean-Pierre Garnier chief executive said last month Our number one priority at the moment is to build up our pipeline    acquisitions can be a distraction  Sure enough GSK has been busy buying in products from other companies to supplement its unproductive internal drug development projects But Mr Millett remains concerned that management could be drawn away from the current strategy JP Garnier is a man of action He's lost some credibility by telling the market to assume the best for Augmentin If the same happens with Paxil another drug whose patents are under threat he will lose even more credibility And that could put him under pressure to make his mark on the acquisitions trail  Lex Page 24,2
2002-06-21, The political career of Makiko Tanaka Japan's leading female politician and former foreign minister was in tatters yesterday after her membership of the Liberal Democratic party was suspended for two years a move that effectively expels her from the party The suspension of Mrs Tanaka's membership successfully curtails her immediate political career but threatens to backfire on Junichiro Koizumi prime minister by turning her into a potentially dangerous political adversary Mrs Tanaka who remains one of Japan's most popular political figures was sacked as foreign minister by Mr Koizumi after she openly challenged his authority and became embroiled in a damaging battle with foreign ministry bureaucrats The LDP's ethics committee decided that Mrs Tanaka's refusal to co-operate with an investigation into allegations that she misused state funds intended to pay her secretary's salary meant she should be suspended However there are strong indications that she was the target of strategically leaked corruption allegations to secure her suspension as according to experts many Japanese politicians use funds meant for their secretaries for illegal reasons Shinkichi Eto president of Toyo Eiwa university and architect of the current system that governs secretaries' pay said in an interview with the Financial Times that about 25 per cent of legislators have secretaries that share the same surname as them He said this indicates they are using state funds designated for a secretary's salary to pay sham secretaries who are in fact family members and then using the funds for other means He added that secretaries' salaries are routinely pooled into common accounts and dispersed based on the political contributions they generate although sometimes politicians use these pooled funds for personal reasons Now that Mrs Tanaka has been suspended she may choose to step up her criticism of Mr Koizumi and firm up her plans for the creation of a new political powerblock outside the LDP's control Mrs Tanaka's main weapon against the prime minister is her popularity Her appointment as foreign minister helped propel Mr Koizumi's popularity ratings to about 80 per cent as he benefited from her reputation as a reformist maverick Her sacking triggered a plunge in the ratings to about 40 per cent Following her suspension she will remain in parliament as an independent member and be prevented from running as an LDP candidate for the next two years unable to vote in party presidential elections and cut off from the party's finances ,3
2002-06-07, The ghost of Stephen Byers returned to haunt the government yesterday as the former transport secretary was forced to issue apology over what Tories called a planned smear campaign against members of a train crash survivors group It followed reports that one of Mr Byers' political advisers sent an e-mail trying to find out whether any of the survivors had ties to political parties Mr Byers said yesterday I want to apologise This e-mail should never have been sent  Alistair Darling the new transport secretary was said to be livid at the news which undermines his efforts to draw a line under Mr Byers' tumultuous time at the department He is very very angry absolutely livid said a senior official Alistair needs to be able to get off to a clean start These sort of things are certainly not helping him do that  The latest scandal has all the hallmarks of the Byers era a political aide and a confidential e-mail leaked to the press This time the aide was not Jo Moore but her erstwhile colleague Dan Corry a policy aide with a far lower profile who accompanied Mr Byers when he moved to transport from the Department of Trade and Industry Ms Moore's e-mails hit the headlines when she urged staff to bury bad news on September 11 Mr Corry who left the department along with Mr Byers sent an e-mail to Labour party headquarters on May 23 asking if people taking over leadership of the Paddington Survivors Group had any known political affiliations The day before the Daily Mail had published an interview in which Pam Warren who chairs the group said Mr Byers told her about his plans to put Railtrack into administration on September 12 This was four weeks before he announced the plan to parliament saying the decision had been reached in the last few days Her claims were embarrasing for Mr Byers and gave ammunition to investors threatening to sue the government Mrs Warren yesterday attacked the government over the investigation This is a pretty sneaky and very nasty and spiteful thing to do she said and demanded an apology from the prime minister The Tories claimed it was an attempt to dig dirt on critics of government policy This is another example of the government machine attempting to smear and discredit a member of the public who is attempting to voice genuine concerns said Theresa May shadow transport secretary The DoT said Alistair Darling strongly disapproves of the fact that this inquiry was made and has made it clear that it must stop immediately ,3
2002-06-21, From Mr Hans Ekdahl Sir The US recently slammed prohibitive tariffs of up to 30 per cent on steel imports from the European Union and a host of other countries in order to improve chances for Republican candidates in key states in the congressional elections The EU responded by imposing tariff quotas on steel imports to shield producers from increased competition from diverted imports It also announced that it would impose retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US worth {XEU}377m $354m this summer and several times this amount later on after getting an OK from a World Trade Organisation panel for full sanctions The recent US steel tariffs have everything to do with politics and nothing with economics They raise the cost of a host of products to consumers and inflict losses on many more companies than profit from them both in the US and in the EU Retaliation by the EU with possible re-retaliation from the US will only inflict more wounds on all sides Seen from the viewpoint of the average citizen and average company trade wars are simply irresponsible behaviour by politicians who for electoral reasons choose to pander to special-interest groups Citizens and companies should speak out against irresponsible politicians who start trade wars to please special interests at the expense of the rest of us Trade wars therefore simply cannot be justified on grounds of public interest Just as regular wars in the old days used to enrich a few warlords at an enormous expense for the suffering citizenry trade wars enrich narrow interest groups at the expense of the public in a destructive negative-sum game The WTO has certainly tried to stem the worst abuses of protectionism by introducing strict procedures for negotiations compensation through market openings in other areas and so on to prevent knee-jerk retaliation However the WTO system and most of the people acting within it still treat trade as a kind of surrogate war where perceived state interests ie short-term political advantage rule supreme Even if compensation for illegal barriers to its exports in one industry is given to a state in the form of tariff concessions in another industry this is cold comfort for the companies that remain affected by the initial unfair barriers Whatever compensation is given from one WTO state to another individual companies still suffer unfairly and the economy as a whole is worse off Consumers and companies are treated as mere pawns who should be happy to sacrifice themselves for the narrow electoral interests that fuel US steel protectionism as well as agricultural and industrial protectionism in other countries around the world It is time for consumers and companies to let politicians in these countries know that they are not doing their job properly and that we expect better from them Hans Ekdahl Director Trade Policy Confederation of Swedish Enterprise 114 82 Stockholm Sweden,3
2002-06-29, When Bernie Ebbers was ousted as WorldCom's chief executive officer in April in disgrace it seemed only a matter of time before Scott Sullivan followed The telecommunications company's 40-year-old chief financial officer had formed a close partnership with the buccaneering Mr Ebbers as they turned the company into a leading force in the bull market WorldCom had used a steadily rising stock price underpinned by rising earnings to take over several companies But John Sidgmore WorldCom's new chief executive spared the quiet intense Mr Sullivan He seemed too important to the company to lose exhibiting calmness under pressure never losing his temper or being tripped up by a question from an analyst He had an extraordinary command of the facts and figures says one person Just how extraordinary is now clear This week Mr Sullivan was abruptly fired by WorldCom's board accused of the biggest accounting fraud in US history He is said to have boosted the company's profits artificially by $3 8bn £2 5bn by counting some of its costs as capital investment That helped the company to sustain its apparently smooth and rapid earnings growth The shock was all the greater because Mr Sullivan seemed to provide the trustworthy anchor to Mr Ebbers' flamboyance He was the one that Wall Street and investors trusted the hardest worker in the history of the world with God's gift of being very bright says one insider It has left those around him struggling for an explanation Some suggest that Mr Sullivan may not have been able to resist the driving ambition of Mr Ebbers who relied on WorldCom's share price being sustained so that his personal stake would provide adequate security for a $400m loan he had taken from the company I think Bernie had a problem with ego and greed Scott had a problem not with Bernie but with trying to please Bernie says a former employee The WorldCom culture say those who worked there was all about living up to Mr Ebbers' demands You would have a budget and he would mandate that you had to be 2 per cent under budget Nothing else was acceptable 'Go find a way to fix the problem' says one Another says Scott didn't want to admit to his mentor that he couldn't find a way to work the company through crisis when the numbers started going south  Mr Sullivan began his career as an auditor at KPMG the same firm that nearly 20 years later would be given the task of trying to sort out the fraud he allegedly engineered After graduating with high marks from Oswego State university in New York in 1983 he left the accounting world four years later for a telecoms company Mr Sullivan joined forces with Mr Ebbers after the WorldCom founder bought Florida-based Advanced Telecommunications of which Mr Sullivan was treasurer The two made an odd pair physically Although he had wrestled at high school Mr Sullivan was dwarfed by Mr Ebbers' basketball-playing physique While Mr Ebbers was happiest wearing cowboy boots Mr Sullivan stuck to suits He was named chief financial officer in 1994 a title replacing the more sober one of finance director The CFO was supposed to be as much financial engineer as accountant For Mr Sullivan that meant ensuring WorldCom's acquisitions produced higher earnings and a rising share price allowing it to buy yet more companies To achieve this he became a pioneer of pro forma financial reporting This involved stripping out all the one-off usually negative items associated with a takeover to present what the company claimed was a truer picture of its underlying operating performance Since the end of the bull market such reshaping of figures has come under increasing scrutiny and criticism The deal-making also brought Mr Sullivan substantial personal rewards Along with the $29m in stock options that he cashed in during his years at WorldCom he was paid substantial bonuses including one of $10m in 2000 Before the company's stock price collapsed his personal stake in it had reached about $200m But there were drawbacks to working at WorldCom Mr Sullivan hated Jackson the Mississippi town where WorldCom was based He treated it like a Third World country and made fun of it every chance he got though he hid it from Bernie says one insider Mr Sullivan never moved to Jackson choosing instead to commute by air from his home in Boca Raton Florida Mr Ebbers had his own gripes According to someone who worked closely with both men Mr Ebbers become jealous of the attention that Mr Sullivan was attracting The financial whiz-kid had appeared on magazine covers and was praised for his brilliance He was gaining a reputation for being the brains behind the operation but Bernie only wanted himself to be the star Mr Sullivan worked a long day in an office next to that of Mr Ebbers arriving at 8 30am and leaving at 9pm He was generally respected and used to sponsor WorldCom's participation in an annual Jackson walk for diabetes research But his intensity could be off-putting and he had little time for social pleasantries prompting some to try to keep conversation light and airy Nor was Mr Sullivan always a congenial colleague Mr Ebbers frowned on senior managers openly criticising each other but Mr Sullivan would sometimes talk critically of colleagues when the chief executive was not around He took particular pride in having achieved so much so young He even tried to fake you out sometimes pretend he was younger says one insider The pressures on Mr Sullivan became more intense after WorldCom's $125bn attempt to take over its rival Sprint failed in July 2000 It marked the end of an era and the telecoms sector went into a rapid decline soon afterwards WorldCom alleges that the fraud started in early 2001 For now it is impossible to tell exactly what happened at WorldCom how the drive for growth turned into manipulating the numbers But one insider believes it is a familiar tale Sullivan sold his soul to the devil he says It's the old story money and power ,2
2002-06-25, It would be easy for policy-makers to lull themselves into a false sense of security over the fall of the dollar So far the currency's long-predicted fall is best seen as a boon both for the US and the world economy For the US it is helping manufacturers but without pushing up inflation and raising the spectre of higher interest rates With the GDP deflator in the US the widest measure of price pressures running at around 1 per cent inflation seems a distant threat Nor is the dollar's fall yet adding to the woes of US asset markets It may be deterring some foreign investors from increasing their exposure to the US but it has not yet led to an exodus of foreign investors from US markets In the eurozone the dollar's slide has been healing the hurt pride of eurozone policymakers over the euro's long decline The currency's recent rise has helped bring inflation back toward the European Central Bank's 2 per cent target forestalling the threat of higher interest rates Since eurozone exports have proved less affected by price movements than those from Japan or the US the gradual rise in the euro is not expected to choke off recovery Eurozone exports do not seem to be massively sensitive to price but more to demand says Ray Attrill head of research at 4Cast the economic consultancy But economists warn there is no room for complacency The dollar's fall has so far been benign mainly because it has been slow On a trade-weighted basis it is down 9 5 per cent since its peak in January Fears are growing that the dollar could reach an inflection point at which its fall will become rapid and disruptive A more rapid fall could lead investors todemand a premium for holding US assets to offset the currency risk It could also have a more profound effect on US inflation and inflict greater damage on eurozone and Japanese exports The prospect of such an aggressive fall is increasing by the day analysts argue We seem to be approaching the cliff edge says Avinash Persaud head of research at State Street the Boston-based investment bank He says the main danger is that the dollar is being seen as a one-way bet Even if everyone expects just a modest fall in the dollar they end up getting a violent one simply because everyone will wait before buying he says The key question is could policymakers prevent such a move In order to do so they would need to convince the market that the dollar was not a one-way bet A timely comment from Paul O'Neill the US Treasury secretary indicating that the administration was keeping a close eye on the currency's fall could accomplish this says Mr Persaud But this is considered unlikely The fact that policymakers are thought to view the situation as beneficial means they may be tempted to wait until it is clearly a problem before acting At this point the juggernaut may be harder to stop Broad pressures that have long been building up on the dollar would then be backed by market momentum The ballooning US current account deficit expected to top $450bn £310bn this year means the US needs to attract around $1 2bn of net overseas funds per day just to prevent the dollar from falling A collapse of confidence in corporate America is making this seem increasingly onerous A plethora of corporate scandals has also undermined confidence in US accounting standards By most standard valuation techniques US shares look overvalued says Mr Attrill The perception that US assets would offer superior returns which underpinned the dollar run has been gradually disappearing If international funds invested in the US over recent years turned homeward the US would need international co-operation The dollar's status as the world's currency has meant that the US has meanwhile seen little need to build up a large intervention war chest says David Bloom currency strategist at HSBC in London Foreign exchange reserves excluding gold and positions held by the IMF stand at a diminutive $30 8bn compared to $409 4bn in Japan Even co-ordinated foreign exchange intervention in the style of the Plaza and Louvre Accords of the 1980s would be more difficult now since international capital flows have grown massively in size In addition markets are sceptical about the capacity of Mr O'Neill to handle a crisis in the dollar Markets still pine for the adroit hand of Robert Rubin Bill Clinton's second Treasury secretary In contrast to Mr Rubin Mr O'Neill is seen to lack the sophistication to master the situation says Mr Persaud His reputation for laisser faire has convinced many economists that he may wait too long before giving direction to the financial markets With no consensus among economists about what point the dollar's fall is likely to become a problem judging the right moment to act will be the supreme challenge for policymakers But they may need to start acting fairly soon to prevent the emergence of a consensus in the market that the dollar will inevitably keep falling ,2
